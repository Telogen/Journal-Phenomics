TI  - Plants in silico: why, why now and what?--an integrative platform for plant 
      systems biology research.
PG  - 1049-57
LID - 10.1111/pce.12673 [doi]
AB  - A paradigm shift is needed and timely in moving plant modelling from largely 
      isolated efforts to a connected community endeavour that can take full advantage 
      of advances in computer science and in mechanistic understanding of plant 
      processes. Plants in silico (Psi) envisions a digital representation of layered 
      dynamic modules, linking from gene networks and metabolic pathways through to 
      cellular organization, tissue, organ and whole plant development, together with 
      resource capture and use efficiency in dynamic competitive environments, 
      ultimately allowing a mechanistically rich simulation of the plant or of a 
      community of plants in silico. The concept is to integrate models or modules from 
      different layers of organization spanning from genome to phenome to ecosystem in 
      a modular framework allowing the use of modules of varying mechanistic detail 
      representing the same biological process. Developments in high-performance 
      computing, functional knowledge of plants, the internet and open-source version 
      controlled software make achieving the concept realistic. Open source will 
      enhance collaboration and move towards testing and consensus on quantitative 
      theoretical frameworks. Importantly, Psi provides a quantitative knowledge 
      framework where the implications of a discovery at one level, for example, single 
      gene function or developmental response, can be examined at the whole plant or 
      even crop and natural ecosystem levels.

TI  - Meta-analysis of correlated traits via summary statistics from GWASs with an 
      application in hypertension.
PG  - 21-36

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many genetic variants 
      underlying complex traits. Many detected genetic loci harbor variants that 
      associate with multiple-even distinct-traits. Most current analysis approaches 
      focus on single traits, even though the final results from multiple traits are 
      evaluated together. Such approaches miss the opportunity to systemically 
      integrate the phenome-wide data available for genetic association analysis. In 
      this study, we propose a general approach that can integrate association evidence 
      from summary statistics of multiple traits, either correlated, independent, 
      continuous, or binary traits, which might come from the same or different 
      studies. We allow for trait heterogeneity effects. Population structure and 
      cryptic relatedness can also be controlled. Our simulations suggest that the 
      proposed method has improved statistical power over single-trait analysis in most 
      of the cases we studied. We applied our method to the Continental Origins and 
      Genetic Epidemiology Network (COGENT) African ancestry samples for three blood 
      pressure traits and identified four loci (CHIC2, HOXA-EVX1, IGFBP1/IGFBP3, and 
      CDH17; p < 5.0 × 10(-8)) associated with hypertension-related traits that were 
      missed by a single-trait analysis in the original report. Six additional loci 
      with suggestive association evidence (p < 5.0 × 10(-7)) were also observed, 
      including CACNA1D and WNT3. Our study strongly suggests that analyzing multiple 
      phenotypes can improve statistical power and that such analysis can be executed 
      with the summary statistics from GWASs. Our method also provides a way to study a 
      cross phenotype (CP) association by using summary statistics from GWASs of 
      multiple phenotypes.

AB  - Microarrays and next-generation sequencing technologies have been increasingly 
      employed in biomedical research. However, before they can be reliably used as 
      clinical biomarker tests, standardization and quality control measures need to be 
      developed to ensure their analytical validity. This review summarizes 
      community-wide efforts such as the MicroArray and Sequencing Quality Control 
      (MAQC/SEQC) project which have identified factors influencing the performance of 
      these technologies. Consequently, consensus-based standards and well-documented 
      best practices have been developed to improve the quality of scientific research, 
      and reference materials and reference datasets have been made available for 
      evaluating the technical proficiency in future studies. These efforts have built 
      the foundation on which the translational application of genomics based 
      technologies can help realize precision medicine.

      C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) level is elevated in a number of neurological 
      diseases involving neuron injury and death. We studied the hypothesis that UCH-L1 
      may be a potential biomarker for DHCA-induced ischemic neuronal apoptosis. 
      METHODS: Anesthetized piglets were used to perform cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). 
      DHCA was induced for 1 hour followed by CPB rewarming. Blood samples were 
      collected and serum UCH-L1 levels were measured. Neuron apoptosis and Bax and 
      Bcl-2 proteins in hippocampus were examined. The relationship between neuron 
      apoptosis and UCH-L1 level was determined by receiver operating characteristics 
      (ROC) curves and correlation analysis. RESULTS: DHCA resulted in marked neuronal 
      apoptosis, significant increase in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio in hippocampus and UCH-L1 
      level elevations in serum (all P<0.05). Positive correlation was obtained between 
      serum UCH-L1 level and the severity of neuron apoptosis (r= 0.78, P<0.01). By 
      ROC, the area under the curve were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.74-0.99; P<0.01), 0.81 (95% 
      CI: 0.81-0.96; P<0.05), 0.71 (95% CI: 0.47-0.92; P=0.11) for UCH-L1, Bax/Bcl-2 
      ratio and Bax, respectively. Using a cut-off point of 0.25, the UCH-L1 predicted 
      neuronal apoptosis with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 57%. CONCLUSION: 
      Serum UCH-L1, as an easy and quick measurable biomarker, can predict neural 
      apoptosis induced by DHCA. The elevation in UCH-L1 concentration is consistent 
      with the severity of neural apoptosis following DHCA.

AB  - Few studies have yet investigated the possible association between high-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and kidney function in elderly patients with 
      primary hypertension. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to evaluate 
      the relationship between HDL-C and kidney function in elderly hypertension. A 
      total of 14,644 elderly hypertensive subjects were enrolled in our 
      cross-sectional study. The patients were categorized based on serum HDL-C level 
      and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) value, respectively. One-way analysis of 
      variance was used to compare the parameters among different groups. Bonferroni 
      correction was performed for multiple comparisons. Analysis of covariance was 
      used to control for confounding factors. The significance of difference between 3 
      groups and more was determined by chi-square test for categorical variables. 
      Serum creatinine and uric acid were negatively related to HDL-C level, whereas 
      GFR was positively related to HDL-C level in elderly hypertensive patients 
      according to tertiles of HDL-C and tertiles of HDL-C/total cholesterol ratio (all 
      P for trends <0.05). The male elderly hypertensive patients showed stronger 
      relationship between HDL-C and renal function than the female elderly 
      hypertensive subjects. Low HDL-C was associated with renal insufficiency and 
      proteinuria in the hypertensive elderly (P < 0.05). The elderly 
      "renal-hyperfiltrator" appeared to have lower HDL-C level, compared with the 
      "normal renal-filtrator" (P < 0.05). There was an inverse "V" shape between HDL-C 
      and GFR by GFR strata. Our results point out that there is an association of low 
      HDL-C level with impaired kidney function in elderly hypertensive patients. 
      Glomerular hyperfiltration may also affect HDL-C level and sex might be an 
      influential factor for the association of HDL-C with kidney function in elderly 
      hypertension.

TI  - Clinical Zheng-hou Pharmacology: the Missing Link between Pharmacogenomics and 
      Personalized Medicine?
PG  - 423-32
AB  - In Chinese medicine, Zheng-hou, instead of disease, is used to define complex 
      medical problems in clinical practice. In the postgenomics era, it becomes 
      particularly compelling to review the application of Zheng-hou in characterizing 
      complex clinical problems independent of disease or syndrome. While disease or 
      syndrome describes a pathological phenotype or phenotypes, Zheng-hou spells the 
      pathological phenome. Clinical Zheng-hou pharmacology (CZP) is an emerging 
      clinical discipline that aims to leverage breakthroughs in the genome-wide 
      solutions for complex medical problems through a combination of the current 
      "omics" technology and the knowledge of Chinese medicine. The concept of CZP 
      suggests that systematic and standard studies of multiple phenotypes will be 
      important because of the collaborative cross between diversified external and 
      internal factors at different levels both in vitro and in vivo. In this paper, we 
      discuss the novel phenomic approaches to the understanding of Zheng-hou and the 
      link of pharmacogenomics to personalized medicine through CZP, or 
      pharmacophenomics. CZP enables ever-finer mapping of Zheng-hou and detection of 
      dynamic variations in most current omics platforms. Although major challenges 
      still remain in identifying and effectively investigating the diversity of 
      Zheng-hou, CZP is expected to pave new paths to the systemic understanding of 
      medical problems. While still at early stages in the clinical phenome domain, 
      there remains great promise that CZP can help us realize the application of 
      personalized medicine and contribute to rational holistic diagnosis and 
      treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Here we present an application of advanced registration and atlas 
      building framework DRAMMS to the automated annotation of mouse mandibles through 
      a series of tests using single and multi-atlas segmentation paradigms and compare 
      the outcomes to the current gold standard, manual annotation. RESULTS: Our 
      results showed multi-atlas annotation procedure yields landmark precisions within 
      the human observer error range. The mean shape estimates from gold standard and 
      multi-atlas annotation procedure were statistically indistinguishable for both 
      Euclidean Distance Matrix Analysis (mean form matrix) and Generalized Procrustes 
      Analysis (Goodall F-test). Further research needs to be done to validate the 
      consistency of variance-covariance matrix estimates from both methods with larger 
      sample sizes. CONCLUSION: Multi-atlas annotation procedure shows promise as a 
      framework to facilitate truly high-throughput phenomic analyses by channeling 
      investigators efforts to annotate only a small portion of their datasets.

TI  - Characterization of Cardiac Anoctamin1 Ca²⁺-Activated Chloride Channels and 
      Functional Role in Ischemia-Induced Arrhythmias.
PG  - 337-46
LID - 10.1002/jcp.24709 [doi]
AB  - Anoctamin1 (ANO1) encodes a Ca(2+)-activated chloride (Cl(-)) channel (CaCC) in 
      variety tissues of many species. Whether ANO1 expresses and functions as a CaCC 
      in cardiomyocytes remain unknown. The objective of this study is to characterize 
      the molecular and functional expression of ANO1 in cardiac myocytes and the role 
      of ANO1-encoded CaCCs in ischemia-induced arrhythmias in the heart. Quantitative 
      real-time RT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining assays, and immunohistochemistry 
      identified the molecular expression, location, and distribution of ANO1 in mouse 
      ventricular myocytes (mVMs). Patch-clamp recordings combined with pharmacological 
      analyses found that ANO1 was responsible for a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current 
      (I(Cl.Ca)) in cardiomyocytes. Myocardial ischemia led to a significant increase 
      in the current density of I(Cl.Ca), which was inhibited by a specific ANO1 
      inhibitor, T16A(inh)-A01, and an antibody targeting at the pore area of ANO1. 
      Moreover, cardiomyocytes isolated from mice with ischemia-induced arrhythmias had 
      an accelerated early phase 1 repolarization of action potentials (APs) and a 
      deeper "spike and dome" compared to control cardiomyocytes from non-ischemia 
      mice. Application of the antibody targeting at ANO1 pore prevented the 
      ischemia-induced early phase 1 repolarization acceleration and caused a much 
      shallower "spike and dome". We conclude that ANO1 encodes CaCC and plays a 
      significant role in the phase 1 repolarization of APs in mVMs. The 
      ischemia-induced increase in ANO1 expression may be responsible for the increased 
      density of I(Cl.Ca) in the ischemic heart and may contribute, at least in part, 
      to ischemia-induced arrhythmias.

TI  - Phenome-wide association studies (PheWASs) for functional variants.
PG  - 523-9
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2014.123 [doi]
AB  - The genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a powerful approach for studying the 
      genetic complexities of human disease. Unfortunately, GWASs often fail to 
      identify clinically significant associations and describing function can be a 
      challenge. GWAS is a phenotype-to-genotype approach. It is now possible to 
      conduct a converse genotype-to-phenotype approach using extensive electronic 
      medical records to define a phenome. This approach associates a single genetic 
      variant with many phenotypes across the phenome and is called a phenome-wide 
      association study (PheWAS). The majority of PheWASs conducted have focused on 
      variants identified previously by GWASs. This approach has been efficient for 
      rediscovering gene-disease associations while also identifying pleiotropic 
      effects for some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, the use of SNPs 
      identified by GWAS in a PheWAS is limited by the inherent properties of the GWAS 
      SNPs, including weak effect sizes and difficulty when translating discoveries to 
      function. To address these challenges, we conducted a PheWAS on 105 presumed 
      functional stop-gain and stop-loss variants genotyped on 4235 Marshfield Clinic 
      patients. Associations were validated on an additional 10 640 Marshfield Clinic 
      patients. PheWAS results indicate that a nonsense variant in ARMS2 (rs2736911) is 
      associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). These results demonstrate 
      that focusing on functional variants may be an effective approach when conducting 
      a PheWAS.

TI  - Global Prioritization of Disease Candidate Metabolites Based on a Multi-omics 
      Composite Network.
PG  - 17201
LID - 10.1038/srep17201 [doi]
LID - 17201
AB  - The identification of disease-related metabolites is important for a better 
      understanding of metabolite pathological processes in order to improve human 
      medicine. Metabolites, which are the terminal products of cellular regulatory 
      process, can be affected by multi-omic processes. In this work, we propose a 
      powerful method, MetPriCNet, to predict and prioritize disease candidate 
      metabolites based on integrated multi-omics information. MetPriCNet prioritized 
      candidate metabolites based on their global distance similarity with seed nodes 
      in a composite network, which integrated multi-omics information from the genome, 
      phenome, metabolome and interactome. After performing cross-validation on 87 
      phenotypes with a total of 602 metabolites, MetPriCNet achieved a high AUC value 
      of up to 0.918. We also assessed the performance of MetPriCNet on 18 disease 
      classes and found that 4 disease classes achieved an AUC value over 0.95. 
      Notably, MetPriCNet can also predict disease metabolites without known disease 
      metabolite knowledge. Some new high-risk metabolites of breast cancer were 
      predicted, although there is a lack of known disease metabolite information. A 
      predicted disease metabolic landscape was constructed and analyzed based on the 
      results of MetPriCNet for 87 phenotypes to help us understand the genetic and 
      metabolic mechanism of disease from a global view.

AB  - In the post-genomic era, biological studies are characterized by the rapid 
      development and wide application of a series of "omics" technologies, including 
      genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, lipidomics, cytomics, 
      metallomics, ionomics, interactomics, and phenomics. These "omics" are often 
      based on global analyses of biological samples using high through-put analytical 
      approaches and bioinformatics and may provide new insights into biological 
      phenomena. In this paper, the development and advances in these omics made in the 
      past decades are reviewed, especially genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and 
      metabolomics; the applications of omics technologies in pharmaceutical research 
      are then summarized in the fields of drug target discovery, toxicity evaluation, 
      personalized medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine; and finally, the 
      limitations of omics are discussed, along with the future challenges associated 
      with the multi-omics data processing, dynamics omics analysis, and analytical 
      approaches, as well as amenable solutions and future prospects.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaf traits with a 
      high-throughput leaf scorer.
PG  - 5605-15
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erv100 [doi]
AB  - Leaves are the plant's solar panel and food factory, and leaf traits are always 
      key issues to investigate in plant research. Traditional methods for leaf trait 
      measurement are time-consuming. In this work, an engineering prototype has been 
      established for high-throughput leaf scoring (HLS) of a large number of Oryza 
      sativa accessions. The mean absolute per cent of errors in traditional 
      measurements versus HLS were below 5% for leaf number, area, shape, and colour. 
      Moreover, HLS can measure up to 30 leaves per minute. To demonstrate the 
      usefulness of HLS in dissecting the genetic bases of leaf traits, a genome-wide 
      association study (GWAS) was performed for 29 leaf traits related to leaf size, 
      shape, and colour at three growth stages using HLS on a panel of 533 rice 
      accessions. Nine associated loci contained known leaf-related genes, such as Nal1 
      for controlling the leaf width. In addition, a total of 73, 123, and 177 new loci 
      were detected for traits associated with leaf size, colour, and shape, 
      respectively. In summary, after evaluating the performance with a large number of 
      rice accessions, the combination of GWAS and high-throughput leaf phenotyping 
      (HLS) has proven a valuable strategy to identify the genetic loci controlling 
      rice leaf traits.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a common complex disorder with poorly understood 
      mechanisms and no effective drug treatments. Despite the high prevalence and vast 
      unmet medical need represented by the disease, many drug companies have moved 
      away from the development of drugs for SCZ. Therefore, alternative strategies are 
      needed for the discovery of truly innovative drug treatments for SCZ. Here, we 
      present a disease phenome-driven computational drug repositioning approach for 
      SCZ. We developed a novel drug repositioning system, PhenoPredict, by inferring 
      drug treatments for SCZ from diseases that are phenotypically related to SCZ. The 
      key to PhenoPredict is the availability of a comprehensive drug treatment 
      knowledge base that we recently constructed. PhenoPredict retrieved all 18 
      FDA-approved SCZ drugs and ranked them highly (recall=1.0, and average ranking of 
      8.49%). When compared to PREDICT, one of the most comprehensive drug 
      repositioning systems currently available, in novel predictions, PhenoPredict 
      represented clear improvements over PREDICT in Precision-Recall (PR) curves, with 
      a significant 98.8% improvement in the area under curve (AUC) of the PR curves. 
      In addition, we discovered many drug candidates with mechanisms of action 
      fundamentally different from traditional antipsychotics, some of which had 
      published literature evidence indicating their treatment benefits in SCZ 
      patients. In summary, although the fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms of 
      SCZ remain unknown, integrated systems approaches to studying phenotypic 
      connections among diseases may facilitate the discovery of innovative SCZ drugs.

PG  - 1796-804
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu854 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Plant phenomics, the collection of large-scale plant phenotype data, 
      is growing exponentially. The resources have become essential component of modern 
      plant science. Such complex datasets are critical for understanding the 
      mechanisms governing energy intake and storage in plants, and this is essential 
      for improving crop productivity. However, a major issue facing these efforts is 
      the determination of the quality of phenotypic data. Automated methods are needed 
      to identify and characterize alterations caused by system errors, all of which 
      are difficult to remove in the data collection step and distinguish them from 
      more interesting cases of altered biological responses. RESULTS: As a step 
      towards solving this problem, we have developed a coarse-to-refined model called 
      dynamic filter to identify abnormalities in plant photosynthesis phenotype data 
      by comparing light responses of photosynthesis using a simplified kinetic model 
      of photosynthesis. Dynamic filter employs an expectation-maximization process to 
      adjust the kinetic model in coarse and refined regions to identify both 
      abnormalities and biological outliers. The experimental results show that our 
      algorithm can effectively identify most of the abnormalities in both real and 
      synthetic datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Software available at 
      www.msu.edu/%7Ejinchen/DynamicFilter .

LID - e0125138
AB  - MOTIVATION: The availability of ontologies and systematic documentations of 
      phenotypes and their genetic associations has enabled large-scale network-based 
      global analyses of the association between the complete collection of phenotypes 
      (phenome) and genes. To provide a fundamental understanding of how the network 
      information is relevant to phenotype-gene associations, we analyze the circular 
      bigraphs (CBGs) in OMIM human disease phenotype-gene association network and MGI 
      mouse phentoype-gene association network, and introduce a bi-random walk (BiRW) 
      algorithm to capture the CBG patterns in the networks for unveiling human and 
      mouse phenome-genome association. BiRW performs separate random walk 
      simultaneously on gene interaction network and phenotype similarity network to 
      explore gene paths and phenotype paths in CBGs of different sizes to summarize 
      their associations as predictions. RESULTS: The analysis of both OMIM and MGI 
      associations revealed that majority of the phenotype-gene associations are 
      covered by CBG patterns of small path lengths, and there is a clear correlation 
      between the CBG coverage and the predictability of the phenotype-gene 
      associations. In the experiments on recovering known associations in 
      cross-validations on human disease phenotypes and mouse phenotypes, BiRW 
      effectively improved prediction performance over the compared methods. The 
      constructed global human disease phenome-genome association map also revealed 
      interesting new predictions and phenotype-gene modules by disease classes.

PG  - 42169-82
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.5888 [doi]
AB  - STIM1 overexpression has been observed in a portion of colorectal cancer (CRC) 
      patients and associated with cancer cell invasion and migration. To characterize 
      the distinctive expression profiles associated with stromal interaction molecule 
      1 (STIM1) overexpression/low-expression between CRC subtypes, and further assess 
      the divergence transcription regulation impact of STIM1 between colon (COADs) and 
      rectum (READs) adenocarcinomas in order to depict the role of SOCE pathway in 
      CRCs, we have conducted a comprehensive phenome-transcriptome-interactome 
      analysis to clarify underlying molecular differences of COADs/READs contributed 
      by STIM1. Results demonstrated that a number of novel STIM1-associated signatures 
      have been identified in COADs but not READs. Specifically, the presence of STIM1 
      overexpression in COADs, which represented a disturbance of the SOCE pathway, was 
      associated with cell migration and cell motility properties. We identified 11 
      prognostic mRNA/miRNA predictors associated with the overall survival of COAD 
      patients, suggesting the correlation of STIM1-associated features to 
      clinicopathological outcomes. These findings enhance our understanding on 
      differences between CRC subtypes in panoramic view, and suggested STIM1 as a 
      promising therapeutic biomarker in COADs.

TI  - Development and Validation of a High-Throughput Ultrahigh-Performance Liquid 
      Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Approach for Screening of Oxylipins and Their 
      Precursors.
PG  - 11721-31
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.5b02794 [doi]
AB  - Lipid mediators, highly bioactive compounds synthesized from polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids (PUFAs), have a fundamental role in the initiation and signaling of 
      the inflammatory response. Although extensively studied in isolation, only a 
      limited number of analytical methods offer a comprehensive coverage of the 
      oxylipin synthetic cascade applicable to a wide range of human biofluids. We 
      report the development of an ultrahigh-performance liquid 
      chromatography-electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry 
      (UHPLC-MS) assay to quantify oxylipins and their PUFA precursors in 100 μL of 
      human serum, plasma, urine, and cell culture supernatant. A single 15 min UHPLC 
      run enables the quantification of 43 oxylipins and 5 PUFAs, covering pro and 
      anti-inflammatory lipid mediators synthesized across the cyclooxygenase (COX), 
      lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathways. The method was 
      validated in multiple biofluid matrixes (serum, plasma, urine, and cell 
      supernatant) and suppliers, ensuring its suitability for large scale metabonomic 
      studies. The approach is accurate, precise, and reproducible (RSD < 15%) over 
      multiple days and concentrations. Very high sensitivity is achieved with limits 
      of quantification inferior to picograms for the majority of analytes (0.05-125 
      pg) and linear range spanning up to 5 orders of magnitude. This enabled the 
      quantification of the great majority of these analytes at their low endogenous 
      level in human biofluids. We successfully applied the procedure to individuals 
      undergoing a fasting intervention; oxylipin profiles highlighted significantly 
      altered PUFA and inflammatory profiles in accordance with previously published 
      studies as well as offered new insight on the modulation of the biosynthetic 
      cascade responsible for the regulation of oxylipins.

AB  - Research into the genetic and environmental factors behind complex trait 
      variation has traditionally been segregated into distinct scientific camps. The 
      reductionist approach aims to decrypt phenotypic variability bit by bit, founded 
      on the underlying hypothesis that genome-to-phenome relations are largely 
      constructed from the additive effects of their molecular players. In contrast, 
      the systems approach aims to examine large-scale interactions of many components 
      simultaneously, on the premise that interactions in gene networks can be both 
      linear and non-linear. Both approaches are complementary, and they are becoming 
      increasingly intertwined due to developments in gene editing tools, omics 
      technologies, and population resources. Together, these strategies are beginning 
      to drive the next era in complex trait research, paving the way to improve 
      agriculture and toward more personalized medicine.

AB  - The convergence of two rapidly developing technologies - high-throughput 
      genotyping and electronic health records (EHRs) - gives scientists an 
      unprecedented opportunity to utilize routine healthcare data to accelerate 
      genomic discovery. Institutions and healthcare systems have been building 
      EHR-linked DNA biobanks to enable such a vision. However, the precise extraction 
      of detailed disease and drug-response phenotype information hidden in EHRs is not 
      an easy task. EHR-based studies have successfully replicated known associations, 
      made new discoveries for diseases and drug response traits, rapidly contributed 
      cases and controls to large meta-analyses, and demonstrated the potential of EHRs 
      for broad-based phenome-wide association studies. In this review, we summarize 
      the advantages and challenges of repurposing EHR data for genetic research. We 
      also highlight recent notable studies and novel approaches to provide an overview 
      of advanced EHR-based phenotyping.

AB  - Our aim was to uncover unrecognized phenomic relationships using force-based 
      network visualization methods, based on observed electronic medical record data. 
      A primary phenotype was defined from actual patient profiles in the 
      Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II database. Network 
      visualizations depicting primary relationships were compared to those 
      incorporating secondary adjacencies. Interactivity was enabled through a 
      phenotype visualization software concept: the Phenomics Advisor. Subendocardial 
      infarction with cardiac arrest was demonstrated as a sample phenotype; there were 
      332 primarily adjacent diagnoses, with 5423 relationships. Primary network 
      visualization suggested a treatment-related complication phenotype and several 
      rare diagnoses; re-clustering by secondary relationships revealed an emergent 
      cluster of smokers with the metabolic syndrome. Network visualization reveals 
      phenotypic patterns that may have remained occult in pairwise correlation 
      analysis. Visualization of complex data, potentially offered as point-of-care 
      tools on mobile devices, may allow clinicians and researchers to quickly generate 
      hypotheses and gain deeper understanding of patient subpopulations.

TI  - MiR-29 Induces K562 Cell Apoptosis by Down-Regulating FoxM1.
PG  - 3115-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Leukemia seriously threatens human life and health. MicroRNAs can 
      regulate cell growth, proliferation, and death. This article investigated the 
      role of miR-29 on regulating leukemia cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: miR-29 and scramble miRNA were transfected to K562 cells. 
      MTT assay, colony formation assay, caspase-3 activity detection, and flow 
      cytometry were applied to test miR-29 effect on cell growth, proliferation, and 
      apoptosis. Western blot was used to detect Forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1) 
      protein expression. After we transfected miR-29, K562 cells were transfected with 
      FoxM1 siRNA to test cell apoptosis. RESULTS: K562 cell growth and proliferation 
      were inhibited after transfection with miR-29. Apoptosis phenome and caspase-3 
      activation were observed. FoxM1 level decreased. SiRNA FoxM1 enhanced 
      miR-29-induced K562 cell apoptosis. FoxM1 overexpression suppressed 
      miR-26-induced K562 cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-29 restrained K562 cell 
      growth and proliferation. MiR-29 induced K562 cell apoptosis through 
      down-regulating FoxM1.

TI  - Dynamic Changes in Phenotypic Groups in Patients with Stable Angina Pectoris 
      after Treatment with Xinxuekang Capsule: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 492-503
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To reveal the cutoff point and influencing factors in the dynamic 
      change in phenotypic group in patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP) after 
      Xinxuekang capsule treatment. METHODS: Five hundred and seventy-six SAP patients 
      were randomly assigned to receive Xinxuekang (XXK) capsules or Compound Danshen 
      (CDS) tablets for 8 weeks. Global similarity degree analysis and nonlinear mixed 
      effects modeling (NONMEM) were employed to reveal the cutoff points and 
      influencing factors in dynamic changes in the SAP phenotypic group. The 
      phenotypic group was defined as the six phenotypes in SAP, including angina, 
      choking sensation in the chest, palpitations, dark purple lips, ecchymosis on the 
      tongue, and fine-choppy pulse, which were quantitatively evaluated on Days 0, 14, 
      28, 42, and 56. RESULTS: Variation in the six individual phenotypes and 
      distribution of the SAP phenotypic profile were similar between the two 
      experimental groups, but cutoff points for changes in the SAP phenotypic group 
      were 7.28 and 10.73 weeks in XXK and CDS groups, respectively. Degree of severity 
      of SAP as well as study site significantly affected the tendency for change in 
      the SAP Xueyu Zheng in both XXK and CDS treatment groups. Different Chinese 
      patent drugs affected the tendency for change in phenotypic group in patients 
      with SAP. XXK was superior to CDS in controlling a clinical phenotypic group. 
      CONCLUSION: Based on global similarity degree analysis and NONMEM, the cutoff 
      point and influencing factors in phenomic variation of SAP may be determined, to 
      improve the development and modification of treatment regimens.

TI  - Untargeted UPLC-MS profiling pipeline to expand tissue metabolome coverage: 
      application to cardiovascular disease.
PG  - 4184-93
LID - 10.1021/ac503775m [doi]
AB  - Metabolic profiling studies aim to achieve broad metabolome coverage in specific 
      biological samples. However, wide metabolome coverage has proven difficult to 
      achieve, mostly because of the diverse physicochemical properties of small 
      molecules, obligating analysts to seek multiplatform and multimethod approaches. 
      Challenges are even greater when it comes to applications to tissue samples, 
      where tissue lysis and metabolite extraction can induce significant systematic 
      variation in composition. We have developed a pipeline for obtaining the aqueous 
      and organic compounds from diseased arterial tissue using two consecutive 
      extractions, followed by a different untargeted UPLC-MS analysis method for each 
      extract. Methods were rationally chosen and optimized to address the different 
      physicochemical properties of each extract: hydrophilic interaction liquid 
      chromatography (HILIC) for the aqueous extract and reversed-phase chromatography 
      for the organic. This pipeline can be generic for tissue analysis as demonstrated 
      by applications to different tissue types. The experimental setup and fast 
      turnaround time of the two methods contributed toward obtaining highly 
      reproducible features with exceptional chromatographic performance (CV % < 0.5%), 
      making this pipeline suitable for metabolic profiling applications. We 
      structurally assigned 226 metabolites from a range of chemical classes (e.g., 
      carnitines, α-amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, phospholipids, sphingolipids, 
      free fatty acids, and glycerolipids) which were mapped to their corresponding 
      pathways, biological functions and known disease mechanisms. The combination of 
      the two untargeted UPLC-MS methods showed high metabolite complementarity. We 
      demonstrate the application of this pipeline to cardiovascular disease, where we 
      show that the analyzed diseased groups (n = 120) of arterial tissue could be 
      distinguished based on their metabolic profiles.

AB  - Standard protocols are available in order to apply Phenotype MicroArray (PM) 
      technology to characterize different groups of microorganisms. Nevertheless, 
      there is the need to pay attention to several crucial steps in order to obtain 
      high-quality and reproducible data from PM, such as the choice of the Dye mix, 
      the type and concentration of the carbon source in metabolic experiments, the use 
      of a buffered medium. A systematic research of auxotrophies in strains to be 
      tested should be carefully evaluated before starting with PM experiments. 
      Detailed protocols to obtain defined and reproducible phenotypic profiles for 
      bacteria and yeasts are shown. Moreover, the innovative software opm R packages 
      and DuctApe suite for the analysis of kinetic data produced by PM and panphenome 
      description are reported.

AB  - With the rapid rise in global population and the challenges caused by climate 
      changes, the maximization of plant productivity and the development of 
      sustainable agriculture strategies are vital for food security. One of the 
      resources more affected in this new environment will be the limitation of water. 
      In this study, we describe the use of non-invasive technologies exploiting 
      sensors for visible, fluorescent, and near-infrared lights to accurately screen 
      survival phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to water-limited conditions. 
      We implemented two drought protocols and a robust analysis methodology that 
      enabled us to clearly assess the wilting or dryness status of the plants at 
      different time points using a phenomics platform. In conclusion, our approach has 
      shown to be very accurate and suitable for experiments where hundred of samples 
      have to be screened making a manual evaluation unthinkable. This approach can be 
      used not only in functional genomics studies but also in agricultural 
      applications.

LID - e0181
AB  - In Arabidopsis, leaves contribute to the largest part of the aboveground biomass. 
      In these organs, light is captured and converted into chemical energy, which 
      plants use to grow and complete their life cycle. Leaves emerge as a small pool 
      of cells at the vegetative shoot apical meristem and develop into planar, complex 
      organs through different interconnected cellular events. Over the last decade, 
      numerous phenotyping techniques have been developed to visualize and quantify 
      leaf size and growth, leading to the identification of numerous genes that 
      contribute to the final size of leaves. In this review, we will start at the 
      Arabidopsis rosette level and gradually zoom in from a macroscopic view on leaf 
      growth to a microscopic and molecular view. Along this journey, we describe 
      different techniques that have been key to identify important events during leaf 
      development and discuss approaches that will further help unraveling the complex 
      cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie leaf growth.

TI  - Neuropathic pain phenotyping by international consensus (NeuroPPIC) for genetic

      recommendations.
PG  - 2337-2353

AB  - For genetic research to contribute more fully to furthering our knowledge of 
      neuropathic pain, we require an agreed, valid, and feasible approach to 
      phenotyping, to allow collaboration and replication in samples of sufficient 
      size. Results from genetic studies on neuropathic pain have been inconsistent and 
      have met with replication difficulties, in part because of differences in 
      phenotypes used for case ascertainment. Because there is no consensus on the 
      nature of these phenotypes, nor on the methods of collecting them, this study 
      aimed to provide guidelines on collecting and reporting phenotypes in cases and 
      controls for genetic studies. Consensus was achieved through a staged approach: 
      (1) systematic literature review to identify all neuropathic pain phenotypes used 
      in previous genetic studies; (2) Delphi survey to identify the most useful 
      neuropathic pain phenotypes and their validity and feasibility; and (3) meeting 
      of experts to reach consensus on the optimal phenotype(s) to be collected from 
      patients with neuropathic pain for genetic studies. A basic "entry level" set of 
      phenotypes was identified for any genetic study of neuropathic pain. This set 
      identifies cases of "possible" neuropathic pain, and controls, and includes: (1) 
      a validated symptom-based questionnaire to determine whether any pain is likely 
      to be neuropathic; (2) body chart or checklist to identify whether the area of 
      pain distribution is neuroanatomically logical; and (3) details of pain history 
      (intensity, duration, any formal diagnosis). This NeuroPPIC "entry level" set of 
      phenotypes can be expanded by more extensive and specific measures, as determined 
      by scientific requirements and resource availability.

AB  - Calendar age is the major risk factor for common disease. It is therefore 
      expected that understanding the aging process will eventually lead to promotion 
      of better health conditions in elderly populations. Such insight may be obtained 
      by identifying the genetic determinants of familial and exceptional longevity and 
      age-related disease. Research of these determinants has been performed in 
      candidate gene, genome-wide association and linkage studies. Because exploration 
      of the common variation in the genome did not explain much of the variation in 
      the rate of aging and longevity, researchers in the field have only recently 
      started to investigate the contribution of rare genetic variants to these traits. 
      The increased throughput and decreased costs of next generation sequencing (NGS) 
      have resulted in a great deal of novel applications for sequencing sets of 
      candidate genes, whole exomes, and whole genomes of individuals. Most of the 
      successful NGS applications are as yet those focused on genetic syndromes and 
      cancers for which causal mutations are readily being identified. In this chapter, 
      we discuss the genetic and phenomic aspects of human aging research and the use 
      of NGS data to identify genes relevant for age-related diseases and lifespan 
      regulation, and to investigate the accumulation of somatic genetic variation 
      during the course of life.

TI  - Disruptive de novo mutations of DYRK1A lead to a syndromic form of autism and ID.
PG  - 126-32
LID - 10.1038/mp.2015.5 [doi]
AB  - Dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1 A (DYRK1A) maps 
      to the Down syndrome critical region; copy number increase of this gene is 
      thought to have a major role in the neurocognitive deficits associated with 
      Trisomy 21. Truncation of DYRK1A in patients with developmental delay (DD) and 
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests a different pathology associated with 
      loss-of-function mutations. To understand the phenotypic spectrum associated with 
      DYRK1A mutations, we resequenced the gene in 7162 ASD/DD patients (2446 
      previously reported) and 2169 unaffected siblings and performed a detailed 
      phenotypic assessment on nine patients. Comparison of our data and published 
      cases with 8696 controls identified a significant enrichment of DYRK1A truncating 
      mutations (P=0.00851) and an excess of de novo mutations (P=2.53 × 10(-10)) among 
      ASD/intellectual disability (ID) patients. Phenotypic comparison of all novel 
      (n=5) and recontacted (n=3) cases with previous case reports, including larger 
      CNV and translocation events (n=7), identified a syndromal disorder among the 15 
      patients. It was characterized by ID, ASD, microcephaly, intrauterine growth 
      retardation, febrile seizures in infancy, impaired speech, stereotypic behavior, 
      hypertonia and a specific facial gestalt. We conclude that mutations in DYRK1A 
      define a syndromic form of ASD and ID with neurodevelopmental defects consistent 
      with murine and Drosophila knockout models.

TI  - The detection and characterization of pleiotropy: discovery, progress, and 
      promise.
PG  - 13-22
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbv050 [doi]
AB  - The impact of a single genetic locus on multiple phenotypes, or pleiotropy, is an 
      important area of research. Biological systems are dynamic complex networks, and 
      these networks exist within and between cells. In humans, the consideration of 
      multiple phenotypes such as physiological traits, clinical outcomes and drug 
      response, in the context of genetic variation, can provide ways of developing a 
      more complete understanding of the complex relationships between genetic 
      architecture and how biological systems function in health and disease. In this 
      article, we describe recent studies exploring the relationships between genetic 
      loci and more than one phenotype. We also cover methodological developments 
      incorporating pleiotropy applied to model organisms as well as humans, and 
      discuss how stepping beyond the analysis of a single phenotype leads to a deeper 
      understanding of complex genetic architecture.

TI  - Differentiation of Stem Cells From Human Exfoliated Deciduous Teeth Toward a 
      Phenotype of Corneal Epithelium In Vitro.
PG  - 1471-7
LID - 10.1097/ICO.0000000000000532 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to characterize stem cells from human 
      exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) and to investigate the potential of SHED to 
      differentiate toward corneal epithelium-like cells in vitro. METHODS: Mesenchymal 
      and embryonic stem cell markers were analyzed by flow cytometry. The SHED was 
      cocultured in either a transwell noncontact system or in a mixed culture system 
      with immortalized human corneal epithelial (HCE-T) cells to induce the epithelial 
      transdifferentiation. Expression of the mature corneal epithelium-specific marker 
      cytokeratin 3 (CK3) and corneal epithelial progenitor marker cytokeratin 19 
      (CK19) were detected by immunofluorescence and the reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. RESULTS: SHED strongly 
      expressed a set of mesenchymal stromal cell markers and pluripotency markers 
      including NANOG and OCT-4. Seven days after the transwells were cocultured with 
      HCE-T cells, SHED successfully upregulated epithelial lineage markers CK3 (16.6 ± 
      7.9%) and CK19 (10.0 ± 4.3%) demonstrating the potential for epithelial 
      transdifferentiation, whereas CK3 and CK19 were barely expressed in SHED when 
      cultured alone. Expression of transcript levels of CK3 and CK19 were 
      significantly upregulated when SHED were transwell cocultured or mixed cultured 
      with HCE-T cells by 7, 14, and 21 days. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that 
      SHED retain the potential for transdifferentiation to corneal epithelium-like 
      cells by in vitro coculture with immortal corneal epithelium cells. Thus, 
      exfoliated teeth may be an alternative tissue resource for providing stem cells 
      for potential clinical applications in ocular surface regeneration.

LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv077 [doi]
AB  - Modern biomedical data collection is generating exponentially more data in a 
      multitude of formats. This flood of complex data poses significant opportunities 
      to discover and understand the critical interplay among such diverse domains as 
      genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics, including imaging, biometrics, 
      and clinical data. The Big Data for Discovery Science Center is taking an "-ome 
      to home" approach to discover linkages between these disparate data sources by 
      mining existing databases of proteomic and genomic data, brain images, and 
      clinical assessments. In support of this work, the authors developed new 
      technological capabilities that make it easy for researchers to manage, 
      aggregate, manipulate, integrate, and model large amounts of distributed data. 
      Guided by biological domain expertise, the Center's computational resources and 
      software will reveal relationships and patterns, aiding researchers in 
      identifying biomarkers for the most confounding conditions and diseases, such as 
      Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of predictors of treatment response holds 
      tremendous potential for the improvement of clinical outcomes in bipolar disorder 
      (BP). The goal of this project is to evaluate the test-retest reliability of a 
      new clinical tool, the Lithium Questionnaire (LQ), for the retrospective 
      assessment of long-term lithium use in research participants with BP. METHODS: 
      Twenty-nine individuals with BP-I (n=27), major depression (n=1), or 
      schizoaffective disorder (n=1) were recruited for participation. The LQ was 
      administered to all participants at two time-points, spaced 17 months apart on 
      average, and used to determine each subject׳s score on the Retrospective Criteria 
      of Long-Term Treatment Response in Research Subjects with Bipolar Disorder Scale, 
      or the Alda Scale. Scores were confirmed through a best-estimate procedure, and 
      test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC]) of the LQ was 
      calculated. RESULTS: The correlation between the total Alda Scale scores at the 
      two time-points was in the moderate range (ICC=0.60). Relevant clinical factors 
      such as age or presence of Axis I psychiatric comorbidity did not influence the 
      reliability. LIMITATIONS: The validity of the LQ was not examined. Inclusion of 
      two participants with non-BP diagnoses may have affected the LQ׳s reliability, 
      but re-analysis of our data after exclusion of these participants did not 
      influence the reliability. The absence of measures of mood and cognition at time 
      of LQ may be a limitation of this work. CONCLUSIONS: The LQ holds promise for the 
      standardization of the retrospective assessment of long-term treatment in BP.

TI  - Infertility etiologies are genetically and clinically linked with other diseases 
      in single meta-diseases.
PG  - 31

LID - 31
AB  - The present review aims to ascertain whether different infertility etiologies 
      share particular genes and/or molecular pathways with other pathologies and are 
      associated with distinct and particular risks of later-life morbidity and 
      mortality. In order to reach this aim, we use two different sources of 
      information: (1) a public web server named DiseaseConnect ( 
      http://disease-connect.org ) focused on the analysis of common genes and 
      molecular mechanisms shared by diseases by integrating comprehensive omics and 
      literature data; and (2) a literature search directed to find clinical comorbid 
      relationships of infertility etiologies with only those diseases appearing after 
      infertility is manifested. This literature search is performed because 
      DiseaseConnect web server does not discriminate between pathologies emerging 
      before, concomitantly or after infertility is manifested. Data show that 
      different infertility etiologies not only share particular genes and/or molecular 
      pathways with other pathologies but they have distinct clinical relationships 
      with other diseases appearing after infertility is manifested. In particular, (1) 
      testicular and high-grade prostate cancer in male infertility; (2) non-fatal 
      stroke and endometrial cancer, and likely non-fatal coronary heart disease and 
      ovarian cancer in polycystic ovary syndrome; (3) osteoporosis, psychosexual 
      dysfunction, mood disorders and dementia in premature ovarian failure; (4) breast 
      and ovarian cancer in carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations in diminished ovarian 
      reserve; (5) clear cell and endometrioid histologic subtypes of invasive ovarian 
      cancer, and likely low-grade serous invasive ovarian cancer, melanoma and 
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma in endometriosis; and (6) endometrial and ovarian cancer in 
      idiopathic infertility. The present data endorse the principle that the 
      occurrence of a disease (in our case infertility) is non-random in the population 
      and suggest that different infertility etiologies are genetically and clinically 
      linked with other diseases in single meta-diseases. This finding opens new 
      insights for clinicians and reproductive biologists to treat infertility problems 
      using a phenomic approach instead of considering infertility as an isolated and 
      exclusive disease of the reproductive system/hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. 
      In agreement with a previous validation analysis of the utility of DiseaseConnect 
      web server, the present study does not show a univocal correspondence between 
      common gene expression and clinical comorbid relationship. Further work is needed 
      to untangle the potential genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic relationships that 
      may be present among different infertility etiologies, morbid conditions and 
      physical/cognitive traits.

TI  - Comparison of Leaf Sheath Transcriptome Profiles with Physiological Traits of 
      Bread Wheat Cultivars under Salinity Stress.
PG  - e0133322
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0133322 [doi]
LID - e0133322
AB  - Salinity stress has significant negative effects on plant biomass production and 
      crop yield. Salinity tolerance is controlled by complex systems of gene 
      expression and ion transport. The relationship between specific features of mild 
      salinity stress adaptation and gene expression was analyzed using four commercial 
      varieties of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) that have different levels of 
      salinity tolerance. The high-throughput phenotyping system in The Plant 
      Accelerator at the Australian Plant Phenomics Facility revealed variation in 
      shoot relative growth rate and salinity tolerance among the four cultivars. 
      Comparative analysis of gene expression in the leaf sheaths identified genes 
      whose functions are potentially linked to shoot biomass development and salinity 
      tolerance. Early responses to mild salinity stress through changes in gene 
      expression have an influence on the acquisition of stress tolerance and 
      improvement in biomass accumulation during the early "osmotic" phase of salinity 
      stress. In addition, results revealed transcript profiles for the wheat cultivars 
      that were different from those of usual stress-inducible genes, but were related 
      to those of plant growth. These findings suggest that, in the process of 
      breeding, selection of specific traits with various salinity stress-inducible 
      genes in commercial bread wheat has led to adaptation to mild salinity 
      conditions.

TI  - Profiling phenome-wide associations: a population-based observational study.
PG  - 896-9
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocu019 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To objectively characterize phenome-wide associations observed in the 
      entire Taiwanese population and represent them in a meaningful, interpretable 
      way. STUDY DESIGN: In this population-based observational study, we analyzed 782 
      million outpatient visits and 15 394 unique phenotypes that were observed in the 
      entire Taiwanese population of over 22 million individuals. Our data was obtained 
      from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database.Results We stratified 
      the population into 20 gender-age groups and generated 28.8 million and 31.8 
      million pairwise odds ratios from male and female subpopulations, respectively. 
      These associations can be accessed online at http://associations.phr.tmu.edu.tw. 
      To demonstrate the database and validate the association estimates obtained, we 
      used correlation analysis to analyze 100 phenotypes that were observed to have 
      the strongest positive association estimates with respect to essential 
      hypertension. The results indicated that association patterns tended to have a 
      strong positive correlation between adjacent age groups, while correlation 
      estimates tended to decline as groups became more distant in age, and they 
      diverged when assessed across gender groups. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation 
      analysis of pairwise disease association patterns across different age and gender 
      groups led to outcomes that were broadly predicted before the analysis, thus 
      confirming the validity of the information contained in the presented database. 
      More diverse individual disease-specific analyses would lead to a better 
      understanding of phenome-wide associations and empower physicians to provide 
      personalized care in terms of predicting, preventing, or initiating an early 
      management of concomitant diseases.

TI  - Automatic estimation of wheat grain morphometry from computed tomography data.
PG  - 452-459
LID - 10.1071/FP14068 [doi]
AB  - Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain size and morphology are playing an 
      increasingly important role as agronomic traits. Whole spikes from two disparate 
      strains, the commercial type Capelle and the landrace Indian Shot Wheat, were 
      imaged using a commercial computed tomography system. Volumetric information was 
      obtained using a standard back-propagation approach. To extract individual grains 
      within the spikes, we used an image processing pipeline that included adaptive 
      thresholding, morphological filtering, persistence aspects and volumetric 
      reconstruction. This is a fully automated, data-driven pipeline. Subsequently, we 
      extracted several morphometric measures from the individual grains. Taking the 
      location and morphology of the grains into account, we show distinct differences 
      between the commercial and landrace types. For example, average volume is 
      significantly greater for the commercial type (P=0.0024), as is the crease depth 
      (P=1.61×10-5). This pilot study shows that the fully automated approach described 
      can retain developmental information and reveal new morphology information at an 
      individual grain level.

TI  - Building Zebrafish Neurobehavioral Phenomics: Effects of Common Environmental 
      Factors on Anxiety and Locomotor Activity.
PG  - 339-48
LID - 10.1089/zeb.2015.1106 [doi]
AB  - Zebrafish are emerging as an important model organism for neurobehavioral 
      phenomics research. Given the likely variation of zebrafish behavioral phenotypes 
      between and within laboratories, in this study, we examine the influence and 
      variability of several common environmental modifiers on adult zebrafish anxiety 
      and locomotor activity. Utilizing the novel tank paradigm, this study assessed 
      the role of various laboratory factors, including experimenter/handling, testing 
      time and days, batch, and the order of testing, on the behavior of a large 
      population of experimentally naive control fish. Although time of the day, 
      experimenter identity, and order of testing had little effect on zebrafish 
      anxiety and locomotor activity levels, subtle differences were found for testing 
      days and batches. Our study establishes how zebrafish behaviors are modulated by 
      common environmental/laboratory factors and outlines several implications for 
      zebrafish neurobehavioral phenomics research.

AB  - The high prevalence of brain disorders and the lack of their efficient treatments 
      necessitate improved in-vivo pre-clinical models and tests. The zebrafish (Danio 
      rerio), a vertebrate species with high genetic and physiological homology to 
      humans, is an excellent organism for innovative central nervous system (CNS) drug 
      discovery and small molecule screening. Here, we outline new strategies for 
      developing higher-throughput zebrafish screens to test neuroactive drugs and 
      predict their pharmacological mechanisms. With the growing application of 
      automated 3D phenotyping, machine learning algorithms, movement pattern- and 
      behavior recognition, and multi-animal video-tracking, zebrafish screens are 
      expected to markedly improve CNS drug discovery.

TI  - An image database of Drosophila melanogaster wings for phenomic and biometric 
      analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracting important descriptors and features from images of 
      biological specimens is an ongoing challenge. Features are often defined using 
      landmarks and semi-landmarks that are determined a priori based on criteria such 
      as homology or some other measure of biological significance. An alternative, 
      widely used strategy uses computational pattern recognition, in which features 
      are acquired from the image de novo. Subsets of these features are then selected 
      based on objective criteria. Computational pattern recognition has been 
      extensively developed primarily for the classification of samples into groups, 
      whereas landmark methods have been broadly applied to biological inference. 
      RESULTS: To compare these approaches and to provide a general community resource, 
      we have constructed an image database of Drosophila melanogaster wings - 
      individually identifiable and organized by sex, genotype and replicate imaging 
      system - for the development and testing of measurement and classification tools 
      for biological images. We have used this database to evaluate the relative 
      performance of current classification strategies. Several supervised parametric 
      and nonparametric machine learning algorithms were used on principal components 
      extracted from geometric morphometric shape data (landmarks and semi-landmarks). 
      For comparison, we also classified phenotypes based on de novo features extracted 
      from wing images using several computer vision and pattern recognition methods as 
      implemented in the Bioimage Classification and Annotation Tool (BioCAT). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Because we were able to thoroughly evaluate these strategies using 
      the publicly available Drosophila wing database, we believe that this resource 
      will facilitate the development and testing of new tools for the measurement and 
      classification of complex biological phenotypes.

TI  - Genetic control of root growth: from genes to networks.
PG  - 9-24
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcv160 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Roots are essential organs for higher plants. They provide the plant 
      with nutrients and water, anchor the plant in the soil, and can serve as energy 
      storage organs. One remarkable feature of roots is that they are able to adjust 
      their growth to changing environments. This adjustment is possible through 
      mechanisms that modulate a diverse set of root traits such as growth rate, 
      diameter, growth direction and lateral root formation. The basis of these traits 
      and their modulation are at the cellular level, where a multitude of genes and 
      gene networks precisely regulate development in time and space and tune it to 
      environmental conditions. SCOPE: This review first describes the root system and 
      then presents fundamental work that has shed light on the basic regulatory 
      principles of root growth and development. It then considers emerging 
      complexities and how they have been addressed using systems-biology approaches, 
      and then describes and argues for a systems-genetics approach. For reasons of 
      simplicity and conciseness, this review is mostly limited to work from the model 
      plant Arabidopsis thaliana, in which much of the research in root growth 
      regulation at the molecular level has been conducted. CONCLUSIONS: While forward 
      genetic approaches have identified key regulators and genetic pathways, 
      systems-biology approaches have been successful in shedding light on complex 
      biological processes, for instance molecular mechanisms involving the 
      quantitative interaction of several molecular components, or the interaction of 
      large numbers of genes. However, there are significant limitations in many of 
      these methods for capturing dynamic processes, as well as relating these 
      processes to genotypic and phenotypic variation. The emerging field of systems 
      genetics promises to overcome some of these limitations by linking genotypes to 
      complex phenotypic and molecular data using approaches from different fields, 
      such as genetics, genomics, systems biology and phenomics.

TI  - Unraveling the intricate nexus of molecular mechanisms governing rice root 
      development: OsMPK3/6 and auxin-cytokinin interplay.
PG  - e0123620

LID - e0123620
AB  - The root system is an imperative component of a plant, involved in water and 
      nutrient acquisition from the soil. Any subtle change in the root system may lead 
      to drastic changes in plant productivity. Both auxin and cytokinin are implicated 
      in regulating various root developmental aspects. One of the major signaling 
      cascades facilitating various hormonal and developmental allocations is the 
      Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade. Innumerable efforts have been 
      made to unravel the complex nexus involved in rice root development. In spite of 
      a plethora of studies, a comprehensive study aiming to decipher the plausible 
      cross-talk of MAPK signaling module with auxin and cytokinin signaling components 
      in rice is missing. In the present study, extensive phenomics analysis of 
      different stages of rice roots; transcript profiling by qRT-PCR of entire gene 
      family of MAPK, MAPKK and PIN genes; as well as protein level and activity of 
      potential MAPKs was investigated using western and immuno kinase assays both on 
      auxin and cytokinin treatment. The above study led to the identification of 
      various novel rice root specific phenotypic traits by using GiA roots software 
      framework. High expression profile of OsMPK3/6, OsMKK4/5 and OsPIN 1b/9 and their 
      marked transcript level modulation in response to both auxin and cytokinin was 
      observed. Finally, the protein levels and activity assay further substantiated 
      our present findings. Thus, OsMPK3/6-OsMKK4/5 module is elucidated as the 
      putative, key player in auxin-cytokinin interaction augmenting their role by 
      differentially regulating the expression patterns of OsPIN 1b/9 in root 
      development in rice.

AB  - The Rat Genome Database (RGD, http://rgd.mcw.edu) provides the most comprehensive 
      data repository and informatics platform related to the laboratory rat, one of 
      the most important model organisms for disease studies. RGD maintains and updates 
      datasets for genomic elements such as genes, transcripts and increasingly in 
      recent years, sequence variations, as well as map positions for multiple 
      assemblies and sequence information. Functional annotations for genomic elements 
      are curated from published literature, submitted by researchers and integrated 
      from other public resources. Complementing the genomic data catalogs are those 
      associated with phenotypes and disease, including strains, QTL and experimental 
      phenotype measurements across hundreds of strains. Data are submitted by 
      researchers, acquired through bulk data pipelines or curated from published 
      literature. Innovative software tools provide users with an integrated platform 
      to query, mine, display and analyze valuable genomic and phenomic datasets for 
      discovery and enhancement of their own research. This update highlights recent 
      developments that reflect an increasing focus on: (i) genomic variation, (ii) 
      phenotypes and diseases, (iii) data related to the environment and experimental 
      conditions and (iv) datasets and software tools that allow the user to explore 
      and analyze the interactions among these and their impact on disease.

      for neurologic diagnosis.
PG  - 881-8
LID - 10.1177/0883073814545884 [doi]
AB  - We describe an "integrated genome-phenome analysis" that combines both genomic 
      sequence data and clinical information for genomic diagnosis. It is novel in that 
      it uses robust diagnostic decision support and combines the clinical differential 
      diagnosis and the genomic variants using a "pertinence" metric. This allows the 
      analysis to be hypothesis-independent, not requiring assumptions about mode of 
      inheritance, number of genes involved, or which clinical findings are most 
      relevant. Using 20 genomic trios with neurologic disease, we find that pertinence 
      scores averaging 99.9% identify the causative variant under conditions in which a 
      genomic trio is analyzed and family-aware variant calling is done. The analysis 
      takes seconds, and pertinence scores can be improved by clinicians adding more 
      findings. The core conclusion is that automated genome-phenome analysis can be 
      accurate, rapid, and efficient. We also conclude that an automated process offers 
      a methodology for quality improvement of many components of genomic analysis.

AB  - A common feature of stress signalling pathways are alterations in the 
      concentration of cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]cyt), which allow the specific and 
      rapid transmission of stress signals through a plant after exposure to a stress, 
      such as salinity. Here, we used an aequorin based bioluminescence assay to 
      compare the NaCl-induced changes in [Ca2+]cyt of the Arabidopsis ecotypes Col-0 
      and C24. We show that C24 lacks the NaCl specific component of the [Ca2+]cyt 
      signature compared to Col-0. This phenotypic variation could be exploited as a 
      screening methodology for the identification of yet unknown components in the 
      early stages of the salt signalling pathway.

TI  - Comparative genomic and phenomic analysis of Clostridium difficile and 
      Clostridium sordellii, two related pathogens with differing host tissue 
      preference.
PG  - 448
LID - 10.1186/s12864-015-1663-5 [doi]
LID - 448
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile and C. sordellii are two anaerobic, spore 
      forming, gram positive pathogens with a broad host range and the ability to cause 
      lethal infections. Despite strong similarities between the two Clostridial 
      strains, differences in their host tissue preference place C. difficile 
      infections in the gastrointestinal tract and C. sordellii infections in soft 
      tissues. RESULTS: In this study, to improve our understanding of C. sordellii and 
      C. difficile virulence and pathogenesis, we have performed a comparative genomic 
      and phenomic analysis of the two. The global phenomes of C. difficile and C. 
      sordellii were compared using Biolog Phenotype microarrays. When compared to C. 
      difficile, C. sordellii was found to better utilize more complex sources of 
      carbon and nitrogen, including peptides. Phenotype microarray comparison also 
      revealed that C. sordellii was better able to grow in acidic pH conditions. Using 
      next generation sequencing technology, we determined the draft genome of C. 
      sordellii strain 8483 and performed comparative genome analysis with C. difficile 
      and other Clostridial genomes. Comparative genome analysis revealed the presence 
      of several enzymes, including the urease gene cluster, specific to the C. 
      sordellii genome that confer the ability of expanded peptide utilization and 
      survival in acidic pH. CONCLUSIONS: The identified phenotypes of C. sordellii 
      might be important in causing wound and vaginal infections respectively. Proteins 
      involved in the metabolic differences between C. sordellii and C. difficile 
      should be targets for further studies aimed at understanding C. difficile and C. 
      sordellii infection site specificity and pathogenesis.

TI  - Bile acid profiling and quantification in biofluids using ultra-performance 
      liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 9662-70
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.5b01556 [doi]
AB  - Bile acids are important end products of cholesterol metabolism. While they have 
      been identified as key factors in lipid emulsification and absorption due to 
      their detergent properties, bile acids have also been shown to act as signaling 
      molecules and intermediates between the host and the gut microbiota. To further 
      the investigation of bile acid functions in humans, an advanced platform for high 
      throughput analysis is essential. Herein, we describe the development and 
      application of a 15 min UPLC procedure for the separation of bile acid species 
      from human biofluid samples requiring minimal sample preparation. High resolution 
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry was applied for profiling applications, 
      elucidating rich bile acid profiles in both normal and disease state plasma. In 
      parallel, a second mode of detection was developed utilizing tandem mass 
      spectrometry for sensitive and quantitative targeted analysis of 145 bile acid 
      (BA) species including primary, secondary, and tertiary bile acids. The latter 
      system was validated by testing the linearity (lower limit of quantification, 
      LLOQ, 0.25-10 nM and upper limit of quantification, ULOQ, 2.5-5 μM), precision 
      (≈6.5%), and accuracy (81.2-118.9%) on inter- and intraday analysis achieving 
      good recovery of bile acids (serum/plasma 88% and urine 93%). The ultra 
      performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS)/MS targeted method 
      was successfully applied to plasma, serum, and urine samples in order to compare 
      the bile acid pool compositional difference between preprandial and postprandial 
      states, demonstrating the utility of such analysis on human biofluids.

TI  - Phage Phenomics: Physiological Approaches to Characterize Novel Viral Proteins.
PG  - e52854
LID - 10.3791/52854 [doi]
LID - 52854
AB  - Current investigations into phage-host interactions are dependent on 
      extrapolating knowledge from (meta)genomes. Interestingly, 60 - 95% of all phage 
      sequences share no homology to current annotated proteins. As a result, a large 
      proportion of phage genes are annotated as hypothetical. This reality heavily 
      affects the annotation of both structural and auxiliary metabolic genes. Here we 
      present phenomic methods designed to capture the physiological response(s) of a 
      selected host during expression of one of these unknown phage genes. 
      Multi-phenotype Assay Plates (MAPs) are used to monitor the diversity of host 
      substrate utilization and subsequent biomass formation, while metabolomics 
      provides bi-product analysis by monitoring metabolite abundance and diversity. 
      Both tools are used simultaneously to provide a phenotypic profile associated 
      with expression of a single putative phage open reading frame (ORF). 
      Representative results for both methods are compared, highlighting the phenotypic 
      profile differences of a host carrying either putative structural or metabolic 
      phage genes. In addition, the visualization techniques and high throughput 
      computational pipelines that facilitated experimental analysis are presented.

AB  - Recent progress in genomics and phenomics allows for a more accurate and 
      comprehensive characterization of the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs)—hereafter 
      defined 'QTLome' as a whole—that govern the variation targeted in breeding 
      programs. High-density genotyping now provides unambiguous identification of QTL 
      alleles, and for several traits beneficial alleles at major QTLs have already 
      been deployed in marker-assisted breeding. However, the amount of QTLome 
      information is enormous and approaches to distill and translate this information 
      to breeders remain to be refined. Improved QTL meta-analyses, better estimation 
      of QTL effects, improved crop modelling and full sharing of raw QTL data will 
      enable a more effective exploitation of the QTLome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, there is no software or database solution that 
      supports large volumes of biological time series sensor data efficiently and 
      enables data visualization and analysis in real time. Existing solutions for 
      managing data typically use unstructured file systems or relational databases. 
      These systems are not designed to provide instantaneous response to user queries. 
      Furthermore, they do not support rapid data analysis and visualization to enable 
      interactive experiments. In large scale experiments, this behaviour slows 
      research discovery, discourages the widespread sharing and reuse of data that 
      could otherwise inform critical decisions in a timely manner and encourage 
      effective collaboration between groups. RESULTS: In this paper we present 
      SensorDB, a web based virtual laboratory that can manage large volumes of 
      biological time series sensor data while supporting rapid data queries and 
      real-time user interaction. SensorDB is sensor agnostic and uses web-based, 
      state-of-the-art cloud and storage technologies to efficiently gather, analyse 
      and visualize data. CONCLUSIONS: Collaboration and data sharing between different 
      agencies and groups is thereby facilitated. SensorDB is available online at 
      http://sensordb.csiro.au.

TI  - Snapshot prediction of carbon productivity, carbon and protein content in a 
      Southern Ocean diatom using FTIR spectroscopy.
PG  - 416-26
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2015.123 [doi]
AB  - Diatoms, an important group of phytoplankton, bloom annually in the Southern 
      Ocean, covering thousands of square kilometers and dominating the region's 
      phytoplankton communities. In their role as the major food source to marine 
      grazers, diatoms supply carbon, nutrients and energy to the Southern Ocean food 
      web. Prevailing environmental conditions influence diatom phenotypic traits (for 
      example, photophysiology, macromolecular composition and morphology), which in 
      turn affect the transfer of energy, carbon and nutrients to grazers and higher 
      trophic levels, as well as oceanic biogeochemical cycles. The paucity of 
      phenotypic data on Southern Ocean phytoplankton limits our understanding of the 
      ecosystem and how it may respond to future environmental change. Here we used a 
      novel approach to create a 'snapshot' of cell phenotype. Using mass spectrometry, 
      we measured nitrogen (a proxy for protein), total carbon and carbon-13 enrichment 
      (carbon productivity), then used this data to build spectroscopy-based predictive 
      models. The models were used to provide phenotypic data for samples from a third 
      sample set. Importantly, this approach enabled the first ever rate determination 
      of carbon productivity from a single time point, circumventing the need for 
      time-series measurements. This study showed that Chaetoceros simplex was less 
      productive and had lower protein and carbon content during short-term periods of 
      high salinity. Applying this new phenomics approach to natural phytoplankton 
      samples could provide valuable insight into understanding phytoplankton 
      productivity and function in the marine system.

AB  - To enhance knowledge of gene variation in outbred populations, and to provide a 
      dataset with utility in research and clinical genomics, we performed exome 
      sequencing of 1,000 UK individuals from the general population and applied a 
      high-quality analysis pipeline that includes high sensitivity and specificity for 
      indel detection. Each UK individual has, on average, 21,978 gene variants 
      including 160 rare (0.1%) variants not present in any other individual in the 
      series. These data provide a baseline expectation for gene variation in an 
      outbred population. Summary data of all 295,391 variants we detected are included 
      here and the individual exome sequences are available from the European 
      Genome-phenome Archive as the ICR1000 UK exome series. Furthermore, samples and 
      other phenotype and experimental data for these individuals are obtainable 
      through application to the 1958 Birth Cohort committee.

AB  - PURPOSE: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT-1) plays a 
      crucial role in cytokine-induced beta-cell destruction. However, its precise 
      downstream pathways have not been completely clarified. We performed a proteome 
      analysis of cytokine-exposed C57Bl/6 and STAT-1(-/-) mouse islets and prioritized 
      proteins for their potential in relation to type 1 diabetes (T1D). EXPERIMENTAL 
      DESIGN: Differential proteins were identified using a combination of 2D-DIGE and 
      MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis and were subjected to ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). 
      Protein-protein interaction networks were created and a phenome-interactome 
      ranking of the differential proteins based on their assignment to T1D was 
      performed. RESULTS: Numerous STAT-1-regulated proteins were identified and 
      divided in different groups according to their biological function. The largest 
      group of proteins was the one involved in protein synthesis and processing. 
      Network analysis revealed a complex interaction between proteins from different 
      functional groups and IPA analysis confirmed the protective effect of STAT-1 
      deletion on cytokine-induced beta-cell death. Finally, a central role in this 
      STAT-1-regulated mechanism was assigned to small ubiquitin-related modifier 4 
      (SUMO4). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These findings confirm a central 
      role for STAT-1 in pancreatic islet inflammation induced destruction and most 
      importantly elucidate the underlying proteomic pathways involved.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factors 19 and 21 (FGF19 and FGF21) have been implicated, 
      independently, in type 2 diabetes (T2D) but it is not known if their circulating 
      levels correlate with each other or whether the associated hepatic signaling 
      mechanisms that play a role in glucose metabolism are dysregulated in diabetes. 
      We used a cross-sectional, case/control, experimental design involving Class III 
      obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery (RYGB), and measured FGF19 
      and FGF21 serum levels and hepatic gene expression (mRNA) in perioperative liver 
      wedge biopsies. We found that T2D patients had lower FGF19 and higher FGF21 serum 
      levels. The latter was corroborated transcriptionally, whereby, FGF21, as well as 
      CYP7A1, β-Klotho, FGFR4, HNF4α, and glycogen synthase, but not of SHP or FXR mRNA 
      levels in liver biopsies were higher in T2D patients that did not remit diabetes 
      after RYGB surgery, compared to T2D patients that remitted diabetes after RYGB 
      surgery or did not have diabetes. In a Phenome-wide association analysis using 
      205 clinical variables, higher FGF21 serum levels were associated with higher 
      glucose levels and various cardiometabolic disease phenotypes. When serum levels 
      of FGF19 were < 200 mg/mL and FGF21 > 500 mg/mL, 91% of patients had diabetes. 
      These data suggest that FGF19/FGF21 circulating levels and hepatic gene 
      expression of the associated signaling pathway are significantly dysregulated in 
      type 2 diabetes.

AB  - The recent discovery of heterozygous human mutations that truncate full-length 
      titin (TTN, an abundant structural, sensory, and signaling filament in muscle) as 
      a common cause of end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) promises new prospects 
      for improving heart failure management. However, realization of this opportunity 
      has been hindered by the burden of TTN-truncating variants (TTNtv) in the general 
      population and uncertainty about their consequences in health or disease. To 
      elucidate the effects of TTNtv, we coupled TTN gene sequencing with cardiac 
      phenotyping in 5267 individuals across the spectrum of cardiac physiology and 
      integrated these data with RNA and protein analyses of human heart tissues. We 
      report diversity of TTN isoform expression in the heart, define the relative 
      inclusion of TTN exons in different isoforms (using the TTN transcript 
      annotations available at http://cardiodb.org/titin), and demonstrate that these 
      data, coupled with the position of the TTNtv, provide a robust strategy to 
      discriminate pathogenic from benign TTNtv. We show that TTNtv is the most common 
      genetic cause of DCM in ambulant patients in the community, identify clinically 
      important manifestations of TTNtv-positive DCM, and define the penetrance and 
      outcomes of TTNtv in the general population. By integrating genetic, 
      transcriptome, and protein analyses, we provide evidence for a length-dependent 
      mechanism of disease. These data inform diagnostic criteria and management 
      strategies for TTNtv-positive DCM patients and for TTNtv that are identified as 
      incidental findings.

AB  - Enhancers play a major role in animal development by modulating spatiotemporal 
      expression of genes. They interact with sequence-specific transcriptional 
      regulators in response to internal and external cues to bring about 
      transcriptional changes, thus serving as the critical link between an organism's 
      genome and its phenotypic traits. Deciphering the biology of enhancers is a key 
      to understanding the genetic basis of common human diseases. Although a large 
      number of candidate enhancers have been annotated through genome-wide analyses of 
      chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, and histone modification 
      in diverse cell types, efforts to characterize their biological roles in human 
      diseases have only begun. Recent experiments have suggested a role for the 
      three-dimensional chromatin architecture in regulation of gene expression by 
      enhancers.

TI  - A 1-night operant learning task without food-restriction differentiates among 
      mouse strains in an automated home-cage environment.

AB  - Individuals are able to change their behavior based on its consequences, a 
      process involving instrumental learning. Studying instrumental learning in mice 
      can provide new insights in this elementary aspect of cognition. Conventional 
      appetitive operant learning tasks that facilitate the study of this form of 
      learning in mice, as well as more complex operant paradigms, require 
      labor-intensive handling and food deprivation to motivate the animals. Here, we 
      describe a 1-night operant learning protocol that exploits the advantages of 
      automated home-cage testing and circumvents the interfering effects of food 
      restriction. The task builds on behavior that is part of the spontaneous 
      exploratory repertoire during the days before the task. We compared the behavior 
      of C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ and DBA/2J mice and found various differences in behavior 
      during this task, but no differences in learning curves. BALB/cJ mice showed the 
      largest instrumental learning response, providing a superior dynamic range and 
      statistical power to study instrumental learning by using this protocol. Insights 
      gained with this home-cage-based learning protocol without food restriction will 
      be valuable for the development of other, more complex, cognitive tasks in 
      automated home-cages.

AB  - In the past decade, and pointing onwards to the immediate future, clinical 
      radiotherapy has undergone considerable developments, essentially including 
      technological advances to sculpt radiation delivery, the demonstration of the 
      benefit of adding concomitant cytotoxic agents to radiotherapy for a range of 
      tumour types and, intriguingly, the increasing integration of targeted 
      therapeutics for biological optimization of radiation effects. Recent molecular 
      and imaging insights into radiobiology will provide a unique opportunity for 
      rational patient treatment, enabling the parallel design of next-generation 
      trials that formally examine the therapeutic outcome of adding targeted drugs to 
      radiation, together with the critically important assessment of radiation volume 
      and dose-limiting treatment toxicities. In considering the use of systemic agents 
      with presumed radiosensitizing activity, this may also include the identification 
      of molecular, metabolic and imaging markers of treatment response and 
      tolerability, and will need particular attention on patient eligibility. In 
      addition to providing an overview of clinical biomarker studies relevant for 
      personalized radiotherapy, this communication will highlight principles in 
      addressing clinical evaluation of combined-modality-targeted therapeutics and 
      radiation. The increasing number of translational studies that bridge large-scale 
      omics sciences with quality-assured phenomics end points-given the imperative 
      development of open-source data repositories to allow investigators the access to 
      the complex data sets-will enable radiation oncology to continue to position 
      itself with the highest level of evidence within existing clinical practice.

TI  - Genomics and phenomics of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in children and adolescents: a 
      prospective study from Southern India.
PG  - 280
LID - 10.3978/j.issn.2305-5839.2015.10.46 [doi]
LID - 280
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the commonest cause of acquired 
      hypothyroidism in children and adolescents in iodine non-endemic areas. The 
      genetic analysis in HT shows two types of susceptibility genes-immune regulatory 
      and thyroid specific genes. The exact genotype-phenotypic correlations and risk 
      categorization of hypothyroid phenotypes resulting from these known mutations are 
      largely speculative. The genetic studies in pediatric HT are very sparse from 
      Indian sub-continent. In this context, we analysed the prevalence of TPO, NIS and 
      DUOX2 gene mutations along with genotype-phenotype correlations in hypothyroid 
      children with HT. METHODS: This is inter-disciplinary study conducted by 
      collaboration between a tertiary care endocrinology hospital, biochemistry 
      department of a teaching medical institute and genetics lab. In this prospective 
      study, we employed 8 sets of primers and screened for 142 known single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms in TPO, NIS, DUOX2 genes. The subjects were children and 
      adolescents with hypothyroidism due to HT. Congenital hypothyroidism, iodine 
      deficiency and dyshormonogenetic hypothyroidism cases were excluded. RESULTS: We 
      detected 8 mutations in 7/20 (35%) children in the entire cohort (6 in NIS and 2 
      in TPO genes. No mutations were observed in DUOX2 gene. All our mutations were 
      localized in introns and we found none in exons. Except for bi-allelic, 
      synonymous polymorphism of TPO gene in child No. 18, all other mutations were 
      heterozygous in nature. Genotype-phenotype correlations show that our mutations 
      significantly expressed the presence of associated autoimmune manifestations and 
      existence of family history. Clinical phenotypes of painful thyroiditis, severity 
      of hypothyroidism and absence of goiter were statistically significant in the 
      presence of these mutations. But, they could not reach significance on 
      multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: NIS gene followed by TPO mutations appears to 
      be most prevalent mutations in HT amongst South Indian children and these 
      mutations significantly influenced phenotypic expressions such as severity of 
      hypothyroidism, goiter, auto-immune manifestations and family history.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing approaches have considerably advanced our 
      understanding of genome function and regulation. However, the knowledge of gene 
      function and complex cellular processes remains a challenge and bottleneck in 
      biological research. Phenomics is a rapidly emerging area, which seeks to 
      rigorously characterize all phenotypes associated with genes or gene variants. 
      Such high-throughput phenotyping under different conditions can be a potent 
      approach toward gene function. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. 
      pombe) is a proven eukaryotic model organism that is increasingly used for 
      genomewide screens and phenomic assays. In this review, we highlight current 
      large-scale, cell-based approaches used with S. pombe, including computational 
      colony-growth measurements, genetic interaction screens, parallel profiling using 
      barcodes, microscopy-based cell profiling, metabolomic methods and transposon 
      mutagenesis. These diverse methods are starting to offer rich insights into the 
      relationship between genotypes and phenotypes.

AB  - Capillary LC (cLC) coupled to MS has the potential to improve detection limits, 
      address limited sample volumes and allow multiple analyses from one sample. This 
      is particularly attractive in areas where ultrahigh assay sensitivity, low limits 
      of detection and small sample volumes are becoming commonplace. However, 
      implementation of cLC-MS in the bioanalytical-drug metabolism area had been 
      hampered by the lack of commercial instrumentation and the need for experts to 
      operate the system. Recent advances in microfabricated devices such as chip-cube 
      and ion-key technologies offer the potential for true implementation of cLC in 
      the modern laboratory including the benefits of the combination of this type of 
      separation with high-resolution MS.

AB  - Studies on the biology of mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells) in 
      mice have been hampered by a lack of specific reagents. Using MR1-antigen (Ag) 
      tetramers that specifically bind to the MR1-restricted MAIT T cell receptors 
      (TCRs), we demonstrate that MAIT cells are detectable in a broad range of tissues 
      in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. These cells include CD4(-)CD8(-), CD4(-)CD8(+), and 
      CD4(+)CD8(-) subsets, and their frequency varies in a tissue- and strain-specific 
      manner. Mouse MAIT cells have a CD44(hi)CD62L(lo) memory phenotype and produce 
      high levels of IL-17A, whereas other cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, 
      IL-13, and GM-CSF, are produced at low to moderate levels. Consistent with high 
      IL-17A production, most MAIT cells express high levels of retinoic acid-related 
      orphan receptor γt (RORγt), whereas RORγt(lo) MAIT cells predominantly express 
      T-bet and produce IFN-γ. Most MAIT cells express the promyelocytic leukemia zinc 
      finger (PLZF) transcription factor, and their development is largely PLZF 
      dependent. These observations contrast with previous reports that MAIT cells from 
      Vα19 TCR transgenic mice are PLZF(-) and express a naive CD44(lo) phenotype. 
      Accordingly, MAIT cells from normal mice more closely resemble human MAIT cells 
      than previously appreciated, and this provides the foundation for further 
      investigations of these cells in health and disease.

AB  - Due to an increase in the consumption of food, feed, fuel and to meet global food 
      security needs for the rapidly growing human population, there is a necessity to 
      breed high yielding crops that can adapt to the future climate changes, 
      particularly in developing countries. To solve these global challenges, novel 
      approaches are required to identify quantitative phenotypes and to explain the 
      genetic basis of agriculturally important traits. These advances will facilitate 
      the screening of germplasm with high performance characteristics in 
      resource-limited environments. Recently, plant phenomics has offered and 
      integrated a suite of new technologies, and we are on a path to improve the 
      description of complex plant phenotypes. High-throughput phenotyping platforms 
      have also been developed that capture phenotype data from plants in a 
      non-destructive manner. In this review, we discuss recent developments of 
      high-throughput plant phenotyping infrastructure including imaging techniques and 
      corresponding principles for phenotype data analysis.

AB  - Nucleotide alterations detected by next generation sequencing are not always true 
      biological changes but could represent sequencing errors. Even highly accurate 
      methods can yield substantial error rates when applied to millions of 
      nucleotides. In this study, we examined the reproducibility of nucleotide variant 
      calls in replicate sequencing experiments of the same genomic DNA. We performed 
      targeted sequencing of all known human protein kinase genes (kinome) (~3.2 Mb) 
      using the SOLiD v4 platform. Seventeen breast cancer samples were sequenced in 
      duplicate (n=14) or triplicate (n=3) to assess concordance of all calls and 
      single nucleotide variant (SNV) calls. The concordance rates over the entire 
      sequenced region were >99.99%, while the concordance rates for SNVs were 
      54.3-75.5%. There was substantial variation in basic sequencing metrics from 
      experiment to experiment. The type of nucleotide substitution and genomic 
      location of the variant had little impact on concordance but concordance 
      increased with coverage level, variant allele count (VAC), variant allele 
      frequency (VAF), variant allele quality and p-value of SNV-call. The most 
      important determinants of concordance were VAC and VAF. Even using the highest 
      stringency of QC metrics the reproducibility of SNV calls was around 80% 
      suggesting that erroneous variant calling can be as high as 20-40% in a single 
      experiment. The sequence data have been deposited into the European 
      Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) with accession number EGAS00001000826.

TI  - Large-Scale Discovery and Validation Studies Demonstrate Significant Reductions 
      in Circulating Levels of IL8, IL-1Ra, MCP-1, and MIP-1β in Patients With Type 1 
      Diabetes.
PG  - E1179-87
LID - 10.1210/JC.2015-1388 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Previous studies have attempted to elucidate the potential role of 
      various cytokines and chemokines in human type 1 diabetes (T1D); however, the 
      precise role of these serum proteins in T1D is still controversial and 
      undetermined primarily due to the small sample sizes of the previous studies. We 
      profiled a panel of serum cytokines and chemokines using a large-scale, two-stage 
      study design for the discovery and validation of the serum proteins associated 
      with T1D. PARTICIPANTS: The participants were patients with T1D and islet 
      autoantibody-negative control subjects from the Phenome and Genome of Diabetes 
      Autoimmunity study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thirteen cytokines and chemokines were 
      measured in serum of 4424 subjects using multiplex immunoassays. RESULTS: Using 
      1378 samples in Stage 1, we found that four of the 13 proteins are significantly 
      lower in patients with T1D than controls (IL8: odds ratio [OR] = 0.40; P = 5.7 × 
      10(-19); IL-1Ra: OR = 0.42; P = 1.1 × 10(-13); MCP-1: OR = 0.60; P = 6.7 × 
      10(-9); and MIP-1β: OR = 0.63; P = 4.2 × 10(-7)). Our confirmation data with 3046 
      samples in Stage 2 further confirmed the significant negative associations of 
      these four proteins with T1D (IL8: OR = 0.43; P = 8.9 × 10(-32); IL-1Ra: OR = 
      0.56, P = 3.7 × 10(-27); MCP-1: OR = 0.61, P = 4.3 × 10(-17); and MIP-1β: OR = 
      0.69, P = 2.4 × 10(-13)). Quartile analyses also suggested that significantly 
      more T1D cases have protein levels in the bottom quartile than in the top 
      quartile for all four proteins: IL8 (OR = 0.09), IL-1Ra (OR = 0.18), MCP-1 (OR = 
      0.38), and MIP-1β (OR = 0.44). Furthermore, the negative associations between T1D 
      and serum levels of all four proteins are stronger in genetically high-risk 
      groups compared with the moderate and low-risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: IL8, IL-1Ra, 
      MCP-1, and MIP-1β are significantly lower in patients with T1D than controls.

AB  - The advent of high-throughput technologies has provided exceptional assistance 
      for lung scientists to discover novel genetic variants underlying the development 
      and progression of complex lung diseases. However, the discovered variants thus 
      far do not explain much of the estimated heritability of complex lung diseases. 
      Here, we review the literature of successfully used genome-wide association 
      studies (GWASs) and identified the polymorphisms that reproducibly underpin the 
      susceptibility to various noncancerous complex lung diseases or affect 
      therapeutic responses. We also discuss the inherent limitations of GWAS 
      approaches and how the use of next-generation sequencing technologies has 
      furthered our understanding about the genetic determinants of these diseases. 
      Next, we describe the contribution of the metagenomics to understand the 
      interactions of the airways microbiome with lung diseases. We then highlight the 
      urgent need for new integrative genomics-phenomics methods to more effectively 
      interrogate and understand multiple downstream "omics" (eg, chromatin 
      modification patterns). Finally, we address the scarcity of genetic studies 
      addressing under-represented populations such as African Americans and Hispanics.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders are characterized by major fluctuations in psychological 
      function over the course of weeks and months, but the dynamic characteristics of 
      brain function over this timescale in healthy individuals are unknown. Here, as a 
      proof of concept to address this question, we present the MyConnectome project. 
      An intensive phenome-wide assessment of a single human was performed over a 
      period of 18 months, including functional and structural brain connectivity using 
      magnetic resonance imaging, psychological function and physical health, gene 
      expression and metabolomics. A reproducible analysis workflow is provided, along 
      with open access to the data and an online browser for results. We demonstrate 
      dynamic changes in brain connectivity over the timescales of days to months, and 
      relations between brain connectivity, gene expression and metabolites. This 
      resource can serve as a testbed to study the joint dynamics of human brain and 
      metabolic function over time, an approach that is critical for the development of 
      precision medicine strategies for brain disorders.

AB  - We present the Unsupervised Phenome Model (UPhenome), a probabilistic graphical 
      model for large-scale discovery of computational models of disease, or 
      phenotypes. We tackle this challenge through the joint modeling of a large set of 
      diseases and a large set of clinical observations. The observations are drawn 
      directly from heterogeneous patient record data (notes, laboratory tests, 
      medications, and diagnosis codes), and the diseases are modeled in an 
      unsupervised fashion. We apply UPhenome to two qualitatively different mixtures 
      of patients and diseases: records of extremely sick patients in the intensive 
      care unit with constant monitoring, and records of outpatients regularly followed 
      by care providers over multiple years. We demonstrate that the UPhenome model can 
      learn from these different care settings, without any additional adaptation. Our 
      experiments show that (i) the learned phenotypes combine the heterogeneous data 
      types more coherently than baseline LDA-based phenotypes; (ii) they each 
      represent single diseases rather than a mix of diseases more often than the 
      baseline ones; and (iii) when applied to unseen patient records, they are 
      correlated with the patients' ground-truth disorders. Code for training, 
      inference, and quantitative evaluation is made available to the research 
      community.

TI  - Plant stress biomarkers from biosimulations: the Transcriptome-To-Metabolome 
      (TTM) technology - effects of drought stress on rice.
PG  - 63-73
LID - 10.1111/plb.12221 [doi]
AB  - Measuring biomarkers from plant tissue samples is challenging and expensive when 
      the desire is to integrate transcriptomics, fluxomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, 
      proteomics, physiomics and phenomics. We present a computational biology method 
      where only the transcriptome needs to be measured and is used to derive a set of 
      parameters for deterministic kinetic models of metabolic pathways. The technology 
      is called Transcriptome-To-Metabolome (TTM) biosimulations, currently under 
      commercial development, but available for non-commercial use by researchers. The 
      simulated results on metabolites of 30 primary and secondary metabolic pathways 
      in rice (Oryza sativa) were used as the biomarkers to predict whether the 
      transcriptome was from a plant that had been under drought conditions. The rice 
      transcriptomes were accessed from public archives and each individual plant was 
      simulated. This unique quality of the TTM technology allows standard analyses on 
      biomarker assessments, i.e. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative 
      predictive values, accuracy, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve and 
      area under the ROC curve (AUC). Two validation methods were also used, the 
      holdout and 10-fold cross validations. Initially 17 metabolites were identified 
      as candidate biomarkers based on either statistical significance on binary 
      phenotype when compared with control samples or recognition from the literature. 
      The top three biomarkers based on AUC were gibberellic acid 12 (0.89), trehalose 
      (0.80) and sn1-palmitate-sn2-oleic-phosphatidylglycerol (0.70). Neither heat map 
      analyses of transcriptomes nor all 300 metabolites clustered the stressed and 
      control groups effectively. The TTM technology allows the emergent properties of 
      the integrated system to generate unique and useful 'Omics' information.

AB  - The translational value of animal models is an issue of ongoing discussion. We 
      argue that 'Refinement' of animal experiments is needed and this can be achieved 
      by exploiting an ethological approach when setting up and conducting experiments. 
      Ethology aims to assess the functional meaning of behavioral changes, due to 
      experimental manipulation or treatment, in animal models. Although the use of 
      ethological concepts is particularly important for studies involving the 
      measurement of animal behavior (as is the case for most studies on 
      neuro-psychiatric conditions), it will also substantially benefit other 
      disciplines, such as those investigating the immune system or inflammatory 
      response. Using an ethological approach also involves using more optimal testing 
      conditions are employed that have a biological relevance to the animal. Moreover, 
      using a more biological relevant analysis of the data will help to clarify the 
      functional meaning of the modeled readout (e.g. whether it is psychopathological 
      or adaptive in nature). We advocate for instance that more behavioral studies 
      should use animals in group-housed conditions, including the recording of their 
      ultrasonic vocalizations, because (1) social behavior is an essential feature of 
      animal models for human 'social' psychopathologies, such as autism and 
      schizophrenia, and (2) social conditions are indispensable conditions for 
      appropriate behavioral studies in social species, such as the rat. Only when 
      taking these elements into account, the validity of animal experiments and, thus, 
      the translation value of animal models can be enhanced.

AB  - The inherent complexity of biological systems can be leveraged for a greater 
      understanding of the impact of genetic architecture on outcomes, traits, and 
      pharmacological response. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach has 
      well-developed methods and relatively straight-forward methodologies; however, 
      the bigger picture of the impact of genetic architecture on phenotypic outcome 
      still remains to be elucidated even with an ever-growing number of GWAS 
      performed. Greater consideration of the complexity of biological processes, using 
      more data from the phenome, exposome, and diverse -omic resources, including 
      considering the interplay of pleiotropy and genetic interactions, may provide 
      additional leverage for making the most of the incredible wealth of information 
      available for study. Here, we describe how incorporating greater complexity into 
      analyses through the use of additional phenotypic data and widespread deployment 
      of phenome-wide association studies may provide new insights into genetic factors 
      influencing diseases, traits, and pharmacological response.

TI  - Phenome-Wide Association Studies: Leveraging Comprehensive Phenotypic and 
      Genotypic Data for Discovery.
PG  - 92-100
AB  - With the large volume of clinical and epidemiological data being collected, 
      increasingly linked to extensive genotypic data, coupled with expanding 
      high-performance computational resources, there are considerable opportunities 
      for comprehensively exploring the networks of connections that exist between the 
      phenome and the genome. These networks can be identified through Phenome-Wide 
      Association Studies (PheWAS) where the association between a collection of 
      genetic variants, or in some cases a particular clinical lab variable, and a wide 
      and diverse range of phenotypes, diagnoses, traits, and/or outcomes are 
      evaluated. This is a departure from the more familiar genome-wide association 
      study (GWAS) approach, which has been used to identify single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with one outcome or a very limited phenotypic 
      domain. In addition to highlighting novel connections between multiple phenotypes 
      and elucidating more of the phenotype-genotype landscape, PheWAS can generate new 
      hypotheses for further exploration, and can also be used to narrow the search 
      space for research using comprehensive data collections. The complex results of 
      PheWAS also have the potential for uncovering new mechanistic insights. We review 
      here how the PheWAS approach has been used with data from epidemiological 
      studies, clinical trials, and de-identified electronic health record data. We 
      also review methodologies for the analyses underlying PheWAS, and emerging 
      methods developed for evaluating the comprehensive results of PheWAS including 
      genotype-phenotype networks. This review also highlights PheWAS as an important 
      tool for identifying new biomarkers, elucidating the genetic architecture of 
      complex traits, and uncovering pleiotropy. There are many directions and new 
      methodologies for the future of PheWAS analyses, from the phenotypic data to the 
      genetic data, and herein we also discuss some of these important future PheWAS 
      developments.

TI  - Combining field performance with controlled environment plant imaging to identify 
      the genetic control of growth and transpiration underlying yield response to 
      water-deficit stress in wheat.
PG  - 5481-92
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erv320 [doi]
AB  - Crop yield in low-rainfall environments is a complex trait under multigenic 
      control that shows significant genotype×environment (G×E) interaction. One way to 
      understand and track this trait is to link physiological studies to genetics by 
      using imaging platforms to phenotype large segregating populations. A wheat 
      population developed from parental lines contrasting in their mechanisms of yield 
      maintenance under water deficit was studied in both an imaging platform and in 
      the field. We combined phenotyping methods in a common analysis pipeline to 
      estimate biomass and leaf area from images and then inferred growth and relative 
      growth rate, transpiration, and water-use efficiency, and applied these to 
      genetic analysis. From the 20 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) found for several 
      traits in the platform, some showed strong effects, accounting for between 26 and 
      43% of the variation on chromosomes 1A and 1B, indicating that the G×E 
      interaction could be reduced in a controlled environment and by using dynamic 
      variables. Co-location of QTLs identified in the platform and in the field showed 
      a possible common genetic basis at some loci. Co-located QTLs were found for 
      average growth rate, leaf expansion rate, transpiration rate, and water-use 
      efficiency from the platform with yield, spike number, grain weight, grain 
      number, and harvest index in the field. These results demonstrated that imaging 
      platforms are a suitable alternative to field-based screening and may be used to 
      phenotype recombinant lines for positional cloning.

AB  - We investigated systematic differences in corpus callosum morphology in 
      periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH). Differences in corpus callosum 
      mid-sagittal area and subregional area changes were measured using an automated 
      software-based method. Heterotopic gray matter deposits were automatically 
      labeled and compared with corpus callosum changes. The spatial pattern of corpus 
      callosum changes were interpreted in the context of the characteristic 
      anterior-posterior development of the corpus callosum in healthy individuals. 
      Individuals with periventricular nodular heterotopia were imaged at the Melbourne 
      Brain Center or as part of the multi-site Epilepsy Phenome Genome project. Whole 
      brain T1 weighted MRI was acquired in cases (n=48) and controls (n=663). The 
      corpus callosum was segmented on the mid-sagittal plane using the software 
      "yuki". Heterotopic gray matter and intracranial brain volume was measured using 
      Freesurfer. Differences in corpus callosum area and subregional areas were 
      assessed, as well as the relationship between corpus callosum area and 
      heterotopic GM volume. The anterior-posterior distribution of corpus callosum 
      changes and heterotopic GM nodules were quantified using a novel metric and 
      compared with each other. Corpus callosum area was reduced by 14% in PVNH 
      (p=1.59×10(-9)). The magnitude of the effect was least in the genu (7% reduction) 
      and greatest in the isthmus and splenium (26% reduction). Individuals with higher 
      heterotopic GM volume had a smaller corpus callosum. Heterotopic GM volume was 
      highest in posterior brain regions, however there was no linear relationship 
      between the anterior-posterior position of corpus callosum changes and PVNH 
      nodules. Reduced corpus callosum area is strongly associated with PVNH, and is 
      probably associated with abnormal brain development in this neurological 
      disorder. The primarily posterior corpus callosum changes may inform our 
      understanding of the etiology of PVNH. Our results suggest that interhemispheric 
      pathways are affected in PVNH.

AB  - There is growing recognition that co-morbidity and co-occurrence of disease 
      traits are often determined by shared genetic and molecular mechanisms. In most 
      cases, however, the specific mechanisms that lead to such trait-trait 
      relationships are yet unknown. Here we present an analysis of a broad spectrum of 
      behavioral and physiological traits together with gene-expression measurements 
      across genetically diverse mouse strains. We develop an unbiased methodology that 
      constructs potentially overlapping groups of traits and resolves their underlying 
      combination of genetic loci and molecular mechanisms. For example, our method 
      predicts that genetic variation in the Klf7 gene may influence gene transcripts 
      in bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, which in turn affect 17 behavioral traits 
      following morphine injection; this predicted effect of Klf7 is consistent with an 
      in vitro perturbation of Klf7 in bone marrow cells. Our analysis demonstrates the 
      utility of studying hidden causative mechanisms that lead to relationships 
      between complex traits.

LID - 10.1091/mbc.E15-07-0466 [doi]
AB  - The demand for phenomics, a high-dimensional and high-throughput phenotyping 
      method, has been increasing in many fields of biology. The budding yeast 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a unicellular model organism, provides an invaluable 
      system for dissecting complex cellular processes using high-resolution 
      phenotyping. Moreover, the addition of spatial and temporal attributes to 
      subcellular structures based on microscopic images has rendered this cell 
      phenotyping system more reliable and amenable to analysis. A well-designed 
      experiment followed by appropriate multivariate analysis can yield a wealth of 
      biological knowledge. Here we review recent advances in cell imaging and 
      illustrate their broad applicability to eukaryotic cells by showing how these 
      techniques have advanced our understanding of budding yeast.

TI  - Increased Surface Area, but not Cortical Thickness, in a Subset of Young Boys 
      With Autism Spectrum Disorder.
PG  - 232-48
LID - 10.1002/aur.1520 [doi]
AB  - The Autism Phenome Project is the largest, single site, longitudinal magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) study of young children with autism spectrum disorder 
      (ASD). Previous analyses from this cohort have shown that the children with 
      autism have a total brain volume at time 1 (∼3 years of age) that is 6% larger 
      than typically developing (TD) children. This finding is driven primarily by 15% 
      of the boys with ASD that have disproportionate megalencephaly (ASD-DM) or brain 
      size that is 1.5 standard deviations above what would be expected for the child's 
      height. In the current study, cerebral cortical grey matter volume, thickness, 
      and surface area were assayed from MRI scans of 112, 3-year-old boys with ASD and 
      50 age-matched TD boys. The boys with ASD-DM (n = 17) were analyzed separately 
      from the boys with normal brain size (ASD-N, n = 95). Previous studies of 
      cortical thickness and surface area for ASD children in this age range have come 
      to diametrically different conclusions concerning the significance of cortical 
      thickness vs. surface area. Current analyses indicate that cortical thickness was 
      comparable across the ASD and TD groups. However, surface area was significantly 
      greater in the ASD group compared to the TD group. This result was driven largely 
      by the children with ASD-DM. Even in the ASD-DM group, not all cortical regions 
      demonstrated increased surface area. These results provide strong evidence that 
      the early cortical overgrowth associated with ASD is due primarily to increased 
      surface area and not to increased cortical thickness.

TI  - The digital revolution in phenotyping.
PG  - 819-30
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbv083 [doi]
AB  - Phenotypes have gained increased notoriety in the clinical and biological domain 
      owing to their application in numerous areas such as the discovery of disease 
      genes and drug targets, phylogenetics and pharmacogenomics. Phenotypes, defined 
      as observable characteristics of organisms, can be seen as one of the bridges 
      that lead to a translation of experimental findings into clinical applications 
      and thereby support 'bench to bedside' efforts. However, to build this 
      translational bridge, a common and universal understanding of phenotypes is 
      required that goes beyond domain-specific definitions. To achieve this ambitious 
      goal, a digital revolution is ongoing that enables the encoding of data in 
      computer-readable formats and the data storage in specialized repositories, ready 
      for integration, enabling translational research. While phenome research is an 
      ongoing endeavor, the true potential hidden in the currently available data still 
      needs to be unlocked, offering exciting opportunities for the forthcoming years. 
      Here, we provide insights into the state-of-the-art in digital phenotyping, by 
      means of representing, acquiring and analyzing phenotype data. In addition, we 
      provide visions of this field for future research work that could enable better 
      applications of phenotype data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant phenotype datasets include many different types of data, 
      formats, and terms from specialized vocabularies. Because these datasets were 
      designed for different audiences, they frequently contain language and details 
      tailored to investigators with different research objectives and backgrounds. 
      Although phenotype comparisons across datasets have long been possible on a small 
      scale, comprehensive queries and analyses that span a broad set of reference 
      species, research disciplines, and knowledge domains continue to be severely 
      limited by the absence of a common semantic framework. RESULTS: We developed a 
      workflow to curate and standardize existing phenotype datasets for six plant 
      species, encompassing both model species and crop plants with established genetic 
      resources. Our effort focused on mutant phenotypes associated with genes of known 
      sequence in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (Arabidopsis), Zea mays L. subsp. 
      mays (maize), Medicago truncatula Gaertn. (barrel medic or Medicago), Oryza 
      sativa L. (rice), Glycine max (L.) Merr. (soybean), and Solanum lycopersicum L. 
      (tomato). We applied the same ontologies, annotation standards, formats, and best 
      practices across all six species, thereby ensuring that the shared dataset could 
      be used for cross-species querying and semantic similarity analyses. Curated 
      phenotypes were first converted into a common format using taxonomically broad 
      ontologies such as the Plant Ontology, Gene Ontology, and Phenotype and Trait 
      Ontology. We then compared ontology-based phenotypic descriptions with an 
      existing classification system for plant phenotypes and evaluated our semantic 
      similarity dataset for its ability to enhance predictions of gene families, 
      protein functions, and shared metabolic pathways that underlie informative plant 
      phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ontologies, annotation standards, shared 
      formats, and best practices for cross-taxon phenotype data analyses represents a 
      novel approach to plant phenomics that enhances the utility of model genetic 
      organisms and can be readily applied to species with fewer genetic resources and 
      less well-characterized genomes. In addition, these tools should enhance future 
      efforts to explore the relationships among phenotypic similarity, gene function, 
      and sequence similarity in plants, and to make genotype-to-phenotype predictions 
      relevant to plant biology, crop improvement, and potentially even human health.

TI  - The Founder Strains of the Collaborative Cross Express a Complex Combination of 
      Advantageous and Deleterious Traits for Male Reproduction.
PG  - 2671-83
LID - 10.1534/g3.115.020172 [doi]
AB  - Surveys of inbred strains of mice are standard approaches to determine the 
      heritability and range of phenotypic variation for biomedical traits. In 
      addition, they may lead to the identification of novel phenotypes and models of 
      human disease. Surprisingly, male reproductive phenotypes are among the 
      least-represented traits in the Mouse Phenome Database. Here we report the 
      results of a broad survey of the eight founder inbred strains of both the 
      Collaborative Cross (CC) and the Diversity Outbred populations, two new mouse 
      resources that are being used as platforms for systems genetics and sources of 
      mouse models of human diseases. Our survey includes representatives of the three 
      main subspecies of the house mice and a mix of classical and wild-derived inbred 
      strains. In addition to standard staples of male reproductive phenotyping such as 
      reproductive organ weights, sperm counts, and sperm morphology, our survey 
      includes sperm motility and the first detailed survey of testis histology. As 
      expected for such a broad survey, heritability varies widely among traits. We 
      conclude that although all eight inbred strains are fertile, most display a mix 
      of advantageous and deleterious male reproductive traits. The CAST/EiJ strain is 
      an outlier, with an unusual combination of deleterious male reproductive traits 
      including low sperm counts, high levels of morphologically abnormal sperm, and 
      poor motility. In contrast, sperm from the PWK/PhJ and WSB/EiJ strains had the 
      greatest percentages of normal morphology and vigorous motility. Finally, we 
      report an abnormal testis phenotype that is highly heritable and restricted to 
      the WSB/EiJ strain. This phenotype is characterized by the presence of a large, 
      but variable, number of vacuoles in at least 10% of the seminiferous tubules. The 
      onset of the phenotype between 2 and 3 wk of age is temporally correlated with 
      the formation of the blood-testis barrier. We speculate that this phenotype may 
      play a role in high rates of extinction in the CC project and in the phenotypes 
      associated with speciation in genetic crosses that use the WSB/EiJ strain as 
      representative of the Mus muculus domesticus subspecies.

TI  - Utilization of a high-throughput shoot imaging system to examine the dynamic 
      phenotypic responses of a C4 cereal crop plant to nitrogen and water deficiency 
      over time.
PG  - 1817-32
LID - 10.1093/jxb/eru526 [doi]
AB  - The use of high-throughput phenotyping systems and non-destructive imaging is 
      widely regarded as a key technology allowing scientists and breeders to develop 
      crops with the ability to perform well under diverse environmental conditions. 
      However, many of these phenotyping studies have been optimized using the model 
      plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, The Plant Accelerator(®) at The 
      University of Adelaide, Australia, was used to investigate the growth and 
      phenotypic response of the important cereal crop, Sorghum bicolor L. Moench and 
      related hybrids to water-limited conditions and different levels of fertilizer. 
      Imaging in different spectral ranges was used to monitor plant composition, 
      chlorophyll, and moisture content. Phenotypic image analysis accurately measured 
      plant biomass. The data set obtained enabled the responses of the different 
      sorghum varieties to the experimental treatments to be differentiated and 
      modelled. Plant architectural instead of architecture elements were determined 
      using imaging and found to correlate with an improved tolerance to stress, for 
      example diurnal leaf curling and leaf area index. Analysis of colour images 
      revealed that leaf 'greenness' correlated with foliar nitrogen and chlorophyll, 
      while near infrared reflectance (NIR) analysis was a good predictor of water 
      content and leaf thickness, and correlated with plant moisture content. It is 
      shown that imaging sorghum using a high-throughput system can accurately identify 
      and differentiate between growth and specific phenotypic traits. R scripts for 
      robust, parsimonious models are provided to allow other users of phenomic imaging 
      systems to extract useful data readily, and thus relieve a bottleneck in 
      phenotypic screening of multiple genotypes of key crop plants.

TI  - Druggable cancer secretome: neoplasm-associated traits.
PG  - 119-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genome association databases provide valuable clues to identify 
      novel targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Genes harboring 
      phenotype-associated polymorphisms for neoplasm traits can be identified using 
      diverse bioinformatics tools. The recent availability of various protein 
      expression datasets from normal human tissues, including the body fluids, enables 
      for baseline expression profiling of the cancer secretome. Chemoinformatics 
      approaches can help identify drug-like compounds from the protein 3D structures. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 
      Phenome Genome Integrator (PheGenI) tool was enriched for neoplasm-associated 
      traits. The neoplasm genes were characterized using diverse bioinformatics tools 
      for pathways, gene ontology, genome-wide association, protein expression and 
      functional class. Chemogenomics analysis was performed using the canSAR protein 
      annotation tool. RESULTS: The neoplasm-associated traits segregated into 1,305 
      genes harboring 2,837 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Also identified 
      were 65 open reading frames (ORFs) encompassing 137 SNPs. The neoplasm genes and 
      the associated SNPs were classified into distinct tumor types. Protein expression 
      in the secretome was seen for 913 of the neoplasm-associated genes, including 17 
      novel uncharacterized ORFs. Druggable proteins, including enzymes, transporters, 
      channel proteins and receptors, were detected. Thirty-four novel druggable lead 
      genes emerged from these studies, including seven cancer lead targets. 
      Chemogenomics analysis using the canSAR protein annotation tool identified 168 
      active compounds (<1 μM) for the neoplasm genes in the body fluids. Among these, 
      7 most active lead compounds with drug-like properties (1-600 nM) were identified 
      for the cancer lead targets, encompassing enzymes and receptors. CONCLUSION: Over 
      seventy percent of the neoplasm trait-associated genes were detected in the body 
      fluids, such as ascites, blood, tear, milk, semen, urine, etc. Ligand-based 
      druggabililty analysis helped establish lead prioritization. The association of 
      these proteins with diverse cancer types and other diseases provides a framework 
      to develop novel diagnosis and therapy targets.

TI  - Phenome-genome association studies of pancreatic cancer: new targets for therapy 
      and diagnosis.
PG  - 9-19
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer, has a very high mortality rate and requires novel 
      molecular targets for diagnosis and therapy. Genetic association studies over 
      databases offer an attractive starting point for gene discovery. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Phenome Genome 
      Integrator (PheGenI) tool was enriched for pancreatic cancer-associated traits. 
      The genes associated with the trait were characterized using diverse 
      bioinformatics tools for Genome-Wide Association (GWA), transcriptome and 
      proteome profile and protein classes for motif and domain. RESULTS: Two hundred 
      twenty-six genes were identified that had a genetic association with pancreatic 
      cancer in the human genome. This included 25 uncharacterized open reading frames 
      (ORFs). Bioinformatics analysis of these ORFs identified putative druggable 
      proteins and biomarkers including enzymes, transporters and G-protein-coupled 
      receptor signaling proteins. Secreted proteins including a neuroendocrine factor 
      and a chemokine were identified. Five out of these ORFs encompassed non coding 
      RNAs. The ORF protein expression was detected in numerous body fluids, such as 
      ascites, bile, pancreatic juice, milk, plasma, serum and saliva. Transcriptome 
      and proteome analyses showed a correlation of mRNA and protein expression for 
      nine ORFs. Analysis of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) 
      database revealed a strong correlation across copy number variations and mRNA 
      over-expression for four ORFs. Mining of the International Cancer Gene Consortium 
      (ICGC) database identified somatic mutations in a significant number of 
      pancreatic patients' tumors for most of these ORFs. The pancreatic 
      cancer-associated ORFs were also found to be genetically associated with other 
      neoplasms, including leukemia, malignant melanoma, neuroblastoma and prostate 
      carcinomas, as well as other unrelated diseases and disorders, such as 
      Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease, coronary diseases, attention deficit 
      disorder and addiction. CONCLUSION: Based on Genome-Wide Association Studies 
      (GWAS), copy number variations, somatic mutational status and correlation of gene 
      expression in pancreatic tumors at the mRNA and protein level, expression 
      specificity in normal tissues and detection in body fluids, six ORFs emerged as 
      putative leads for pancreatic cancer. These six targets provide a basis for 
      accelerated drug discovery and diagnostic marker development for pancreatic 
      cancer.

TI  - A GWAS Study on Liver Function Test Using eMERGE Network Participants.
PG  - e0138677

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Liver enzyme levels and total serum bilirubin are under genetic 
      control and in recent years genome-wide population-based association studies have 
      identified different susceptibility loci for these traits. We conducted a 
      genome-wide association study in European ancestry participants from the 
      Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network dataset of patient 
      medical records with available genotyping data in order to identify genetic 
      contributors to variability in serum bilirubin levels and other liver function 
      tests and to compare the effects between adult and pediatric populations. 
      METHODS: The process of whole genome imputation of eMERGE samples with standard 
      quality control measures have been described previously. After removing missing 
      data and outliers based on principal components (PC) analyses, 3294 samples from 
      European ancestry were used for the GWAS study. The association between each 
      single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and total serum bilirubin and other liver 
      function tests was tested using linear regression, adjusting for age, gender, 
      site, platform and ancestry principal components (PC). RESULTS: Consistent with 
      previous results, a strong association signal has been detected for UGT1A gene 
      cluster (best SNP rs887829, beta = 0.15, p = 1.30x10-118) for total serum 
      bilirubin level. Indeed, in this region more than 176 SNPs (or indels) had p<10-8 
      spanning 150Kb on the long arm of chromosome 2q37.1. In addition, we found a 
      similar level of magnitude in a pediatric group (p = 8.26x10-47, beta = 0.17). 
      Further imputation using sequencing data as a reference panel revealed 
      association of other markers including known TA7 repeat indels (rs8175347) (p = 
      9.78x10-117) and rs111741722 (p = 5.41x10-119) which were in proxy (r2 = 0.99) 
      with rs887829. Among rare variants, two Asian subjects homozygous for coding SNP 
      rs4148323 (G71R) were identified. Additional known effects for total serum 
      bilirubin were also confirmed including organic anion transporters 
      SLCO1B1-SLCO1B3, TDRP and ZMYND8 at FDR<0.05 with no gene-gene interaction 
      effects. Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) suggest a protective effect of 
      TA7 repeat against cerebrovascular disease in an adult cohort (OR = 0.75, p = 
      0.0008). Among other liver function tests, we also confirmed the previous effect 
      of the ABO blood group locus for variation in serum alkaline phosphatase 
      (rs579459, p = 9.44x10-15). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data present 
      interesting findings with strong confirmation of previous effects by simply using 
      the eMERGE electronic health record phenotyping. In addition, our findings 
      indicate that similar to the adult population, the UGT1A1 is the main locus 
      responsible for normal variation of serum bilirubin in pediatric populations.

AB  - Grapevine leafroll is the most complex and intriguing viral disease of grapevine 
      (Vitis spp.). Several monopartite closteroviruses (family Closteroviridae) from 
      grapevines have been molecularly characterized, yet their role in disease 
      etiology is not completely resolved. Hence, these viruses are currently 
      designated under the umbrella term of Grapevine leafroll-associated viruses 
      (GLRaVs). This review examines our current understanding of the genetically 
      divergent GLRaVs and highlights the emerging picture of several unique aspects of 
      the leafroll disease pathosystem. A systems biology approach using contemporary 
      technologies in molecular biology, -omics, and cell biology aids in exploring the 
      comparative molecular biology of GLRaVs and deciphering the complex network of 
      host-virus-vector interactions to bridge the gap between genomics and phenomics 
      of leafroll disease. In addition, grapevine-infecting closteroviruses have a 
      great potential as designer viruses to pursue functional genomics and for the 
      rational design of novel disease intervention strategies in this agriculturally 
      important perennial fruit crop.

TI  - Genetics of the dentofacial variation in human malocclusion.
PG  - 91-9
LID - 10.1111/ocr.12083 [doi]
AB  - Malocclusions affect individuals worldwide, resulting in compromised function and 
      esthetics. Understanding the etiological factors contributing to the variation in 
      dentofacial morphology associated with malocclusions is the key to develop novel 
      treatment approaches. Advances in dentofacial phenotyping, which is the 
      comprehensive characterization of hard and soft tissue variation in the 
      craniofacial complex, together with the acquisition of large-scale genomic data 
      have started to unravel genetic mechanisms underlying facial variation. Knowledge 
      on the genetics of human malocclusion is limited even though results attained 
      thus far are encouraging, with promising opportunities for future research. This 
      review summarizes the most common dentofacial variations associated with 
      malocclusions and reviews the current knowledge of the roles of genes in the 
      development of malocclusions. Lastly, this review will describe ways to advance 
      malocclusion research, following examples from the expanding fields of phenomics 
      and genomic medicine, which aim to better patient outcomes.

AB  - Background.  Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) identify genetic 
      associations across multiple phenotypes. Clinical trials offer opportunities for 
      PheWAS to identify pharmacogenomic associations. We describe the first PheWAS to 
      use genome-wide genotypic data and to utilize human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
      clinical trials data. As proof-of-concept, we focused on baseline laboratory 
      phenotypes from antiretroviral therapy-naive individuals. Methods.  Data from 4 
      AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) studies were split into 2 datasets: Dataset I 
      (1181 individuals from protocol A5202) and Dataset II (1366 from protocols A5095, 
      ACTG 384, and A5142). Final analyses involved 2547 individuals and 5 954 294 
      imputed polymorphisms. We calculated comprehensive associations between these 
      polymorphisms and 27 baseline laboratory phenotypes. Results.  A total of 10 584 
      (0.17%) polymorphisms had associations with P < .01 in both datasets and with the 
      same direction of association. Twenty polymorphisms replicated associations with 
      identical or related phenotypes reported in the Catalog of Published Genome-Wide 
      Association Studies, including several not previously reported in HIV-positive 
      cohorts. We also identified several possibly novel associations. Conclusions. 
       These analyses define PheWAS properties and principles with baseline laboratory 
      data from HIV clinical trials. This approach may be useful for evaluating 
      on-treatment HIV clinical trials data for associations with various clinical 
      phenotypes.

TI  - Comparison of predicted and actual consequences of missense mutations.
PG  - E5189-98
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1511585112 [doi]
AB  - Each person's genome sequence has thousands of missense variants. Practical 
      interpretation of their functional significance must rely on computational 
      inferences in the absence of exhaustive experimental measurements. Here we 
      analyzed the efficacy of these inferences in 33 de novo missense mutations 
      revealed by sequencing in first-generation progeny of 
      N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-treated mice, involving 23 essential immune system genes. 
      PolyPhen2, SIFT, MutationAssessor, Panther, CADD, and Condel were used to predict 
      each mutation's functional importance, whereas the actual effect was measured by 
      breeding and testing homozygotes for the expected in vivo loss-of-function 
      phenotype. Only 20% of mutations predicted to be deleterious by PolyPhen2 (and 
      15% by CADD) showed a discernible phenotype in individual homozygotes. Half of 
      all possible missense mutations in the same 23 immune genes were predicted to be 
      deleterious, and most of these appear to become subject to purifying selection 
      because few persist between separate mouse substrains, rodents, or primates. 
      Because defects in immune genes could be phenotypically masked in vivo by 
      compensation and environment, we compared inferences by the same tools with the 
      in vitro phenotype of all 2,314 possible missense variants in TP53; 42% of 
      mutations predicted by PolyPhen2 to be deleterious (and 45% by CADD) had little 
      measurable consequence for TP53-promoted transcription. We conclude that for de 
      novo or low-frequency missense mutations found by genome sequencing, half those 
      inferred as deleterious correspond to nearly neutral mutations that have little 
      impact on the clinical phenotype of individual cases but will nevertheless become 
      subject to purifying selection.

TI  - MR-PheWAS: hypothesis prioritization among potential causal effects of body mass 
      index on many outcomes, using Mendelian randomization.
PG  - 16645

AB  - Observational cohort studies can provide rich datasets with a diverse range of 
      phenotypic variables. However, hypothesis-driven epidemiological analyses by 
      definition only test particular hypotheses chosen by researchers. Furthermore, 
      observational analyses may not provide robust evidence of causality, as they are 
      susceptible to confounding, reverse causation and measurement error. Using body 
      mass index (BMI) as an exemplar, we demonstrate a novel extension to the 
      phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) approach, using automated screening with 
      genotypic instruments to screen for causal associations amongst any number of 
      phenotypic outcomes. We used a sample of 8,121 children from the ALSPAC dataset, 
      and tested the linear association of a BMI-associated allele score with 172 
      phenotypic outcomes (with variable sample sizes). We also performed an 
      instrumental variable analysis to estimate the causal effect of BMI on each 
      phenotype. We found 21 of the 172 outcomes were associated with the allele score 
      at an unadjusted p < 0.05 threshold, and use Bonferroni corrections, permutation 
      testing and estimates of the false discovery rate to consider the strength of 
      results given the number of tests performed. The most strongly associated 
      outcomes included leptin, lipid profile, and blood pressure. We also found novel 
      evidence of effects of BMI on a global self-worth score.

TI  - Genetic diversity for root plasticity and nitrogen uptake in wheat seedlings.
PG  - 942-956
LID - 10.1071/FP15041 [doi]
AB  - Enhancing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of wheat is a major focus for wheat 
      breeding programs. NUE may be improved by identifying genotypes that are 
      competitive for nitrogen (N) uptake in early vegetative stages of growth and are 
      able to invest that N in grain. Breeders tend to select high yielding genotypes 
      under conditions of medium to high N supply, but it is not known whether this 
      influences the selection of root plasticity traits or whether, over time, 
      breeders have selected genotypes with higher N uptake efficiency. To address 
      this, genotypes were selected from CIMMYT (1966-1985) and Australian (1999-2007) 
      breeding programs. Genotypes from both programs responded to low N supply by 
      expanding their root surface area through increased total root number and/or 
      length of lateral roots. Australian genotypes were N responsive (accumulated more 
      N under high N than under low N) whereas CIMMYT genotypes were not very N 
      responsive. This could not be explained by differences in N uptake capacity as 
      shown by 15N flux analysis of two representative genotypes with contrasting N 
      accumulation. Expression analysis of nitrate transporter genes revealed that the 
      high-affinity transport system accounted for the majority of root nitrate uptake 
      in wheat seedlings under both low and high N conditions.

TI  - $1 DNA barcodes for reconstructing complex phenomes and finding rare species in 
      specimen-rich samples.
PG  - 100-110
LID - 10.1111/cla.12115 [doi]
AB  - Several of the biggest challenges in taxonomy and systematics are related to a 
      toxic mixture of small size, abundance, and rarity. There are too many species in 
      groups with too few taxonomists and many of these species are very rare and hard 
      to find because they are hidden in mass samples. To make matters worse, these 
      species often have life-history stages that are morphologically so different that 
      it is difficult to identify them as semaphoronts of the same species. We 
      demonstrate that these biodiversity challenges can be addressed with 
      cost-effective molecular markers. Here, we describe a next-generation-sequencing 
      protocol that can yield barcodes at a chemical cost of < 0.40 USD per specimen. 
      We use this protocol to generate molecular markers for 1015 specimens of tropical 
      midges (Diptera: Chironomidae). The barcodes cluster into 52-61 molecular 
      operational taxonomic units (OTUs) depending on whether Objective Clustering 
      (OC), Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC), or Poisson Tree Process (PTP) is 
      used. More than half of the putative species are rare (< 10 specimens) and we are 
      able to match larvae and adults for 24 of these OTUs. We argue that the proposed 
      protocol will help with processing specimen-rich biodiversity samples at low 
      cost.

TI  - Surpassing the Target: How a Recruitment Campaign Transformed the Participant 
      Accrual Trajectory in the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project.
PG  - 518-25
LID - 10.1111/cts.12307 [doi]
AB  - Participant recruitment challenges pervade the majority of publicly funded 
      clinical trials. However, little is known about methods for enhancing participant 
      accrual. The Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP), a multicenter study funded 
      by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), aimed to 
      enroll a total of 5,250 participants to better understand the genetic causes and 
      phenotypic manifestations of epilepsy. However, similar to other trials, EPGP 
      encountered recruitment challenges, and by the end of its first year, net 
      enrollment was only 48% of the target for that time. To address this, EPGP 
      established a National Participant Recruitment Campaign and began implementing 
      and tracking the enrollment outcomes of a variety of proven and relatively novel 
      recruitment methods. At the conclusion of the project, EPGP had successfully 
      enrolled a total of 5,445 participants, thus surpassing its enrollment target. 
      Data pertaining to EPGP's National Participant Recruitment Campaign was analyzed 
      retrospectively, and the results are reported here, so that other multicenter 
      trials may consider these methods in their recruitment planning and potentially 
      avoid the costly repercussions of participant accrual issues.

AB  - Modern cancer research on prognostic and predictive biomarkers demands the 
      integration of established and emerging high-throughput technologies. However, 
      these data are meaningless unless carefully integrated with patient clinical 
      outcome and epidemiological information. Integrated datasets hold the key to 
      discovering new biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer. We have developed a 
      novel approach and set of methods for integrating and interrogating phenomic, 
      genomic and clinical data sets to facilitate cancer biomarker discovery and 
      patient stratification. Applied to a known paradigm, the biological and clinical 
      relevance of TP53, PICan was able to recapitulate the known biomarker status and 
      prognostic significance at a DNA, RNA and protein levels.

TI  - Association of brain immune genes with social behavior of inbred mouse strains.
PG  - 75
LID - 10.1186/s12974-015-0297-5 [doi]
LID - 75
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social deficit is one of the core symptoms of neuropsychiatric 
      diseases, in which immune genes play an important role. Although a few immune 
      genes have been shown to regulate social and emotional behaviors, how immune gene 
      network(s) may jointly regulate sociability has not been investigated so far. 
      METHODS: To decipher the potential immune-mediated mechanisms underlying social 
      behavior, we first studied the brain microarray data of eight inbred mouse 
      strains with known variations in social behavior and retrieved the differentially 
      expressed immune genes. We then made a protein-protein interaction analysis of 
      them to find the major networks and explored the potential association of these 
      genes with the behavior and brain morphology in the mouse phenome database. To 
      validate the expression and function of the candidate immune genes, we selected 
      the C57BL/6 J and DBA/2 J strains among the eight inbred strains, compared their 
      social behaviors in resident-intruder and 3-chambered social tests and the mRNA 
      levels of these genes, and analyzed the correlations of these genes with the 
      social behaviors. RESULTS: A group of immune genes were differentially expressed 
      in the brains of these mouse strains. The representative C57BL/6 J and DBA/2 J 
      strains displayed significant differences in social behaviors, DBA/2 J mice being 
      less active in social dominance and social interaction than C57BL/6 J mice. The 
      mRNA levels of H2-d1 in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus and 
      C1qb in the hippocampus of the DBA/2 J strain were significantly down-regulated 
      as compared to those in the C57BL/6 J strain. In contrast, Polr3b in the 
      hippocampus and Tnfsf13b in the prefrontal cortex of the DBA/2 J strain were 
      up-regulated. Furthermore, C1qb, Cx3cl1, H2-d1, H2-k1, Polr3b, and Tnfsf13b were 
      predicted to be associated with various behavioral and brain morphological 
      features across the eight inbred strains. Importantly, the C1qb mRNA level was 
      confirmed to be significantly correlated with the sociability in DBA/2 J but not 
      in C57BL/6 J mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided evidence on the association of 
      immune gene network(s) with the brain development and behavior in animals and 
      revealed neurobiological functions of novel brain immune genes that may 
      contribute to social deficiency in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of dried blood spot (DBS) sampling is an alternative to 
      traditional venous blood collection, and particularly useful for people living in 
      rural and remote areas, and for those who are infirm, house-bound or time-poor. 
      The objective of this study was to assess whether the measurement of glycated 
      haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in DBS samples provided comparative and acceptably 
      precise results. METHODS: Venous and capillary blood samples were collected from 
      115 adult participants. After proper instruction, each participant punctured 
      his/her own finger and collected capillary blood samples on pieces of a 
      proprietary cellulose filter paper. Each filter paper was subsequently placed 
      inside a breathable envelope, stored at room temperature, and processed on the 
      same day (D0), four (D4), seven (D7) and fourteen (D14) days after collection. 
      HbA1c was measured in duplicates/triplicates in whole venous blood (WB), 
      capillary blood (capDBS) and venous blood placed on the matrix paper (venDBS), by 
      turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay. Intra-assay coefficients of variation (CV) 
      were calculated. DBS values were compared to WB results using linear regression, 
      Bland-Altman plots and cross-validation models. RESULTS: Eleven and 56 patients 
      had type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively. Mean HbA1c levels were 
      6.22 ± 1.11 % for WB samples (n = 115). The median intra-assay CV was lower than 
      3 % for WB and capDBS on all days. Results from capDBS and venDBS showed high 
      correlation and agreement to WB results, with narrow 95 % limits of agreement 
      (except for results from D14 samples), as observed in Bland-Altman plots. When 
      capDBS values were applied to equations derived from regression analyses, results 
      approached those of WB values. A cross-validation model showed that capDBS 
      results on D0, D4 and D7 were close to the WB results, with prediction intervals 
      that were narrow enough to be clinically acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: The measurement 
      of HbA1c from DBS samples provided results that were comparable to results from 
      WB samples, if measured up to seven days after collection. Intra-assay 
      coefficients of variation were low, results were in agreement with the 
      gold-standard, and prediction intervals were clinically acceptable. The 
      measurement of HbA1c through DBS sampling may be considered in situations where 
      traditional venipuncture is not available. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New

TI  - Effects of Endurance Training Combined With Cognitive Remediation on Everyday 
      Functioning, Symptoms, and Cognition in Multiepisode Schizophrenia Patients.
PG  - 847-58
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbv020 [doi]
AB  - Aerobic exercise has been shown to improve symptoms in multiepisode 
      schizophrenia, including cognitive impairments, but results are inconsistent. 
      Therefore, we evaluated the effects of an enriched environment paradigm 
      consisting of bicycle ergometer training and add-on computer-assisted cognitive 
      remediation (CACR) training. To our knowledge, this is the first study to 
      evaluate such an enriched environment paradigm in multiepisode schizophrenia. 
      Twenty-two multiepisode schizophrenia patients and 22 age- and gender-matched 
      healthy controls underwent 3 months of endurance training (30min, 3 times/wk); 
      CACR training (30min, 2 times/wk) was added from week 6. Twenty-one additionally 
      recruited schizophrenia patients played table soccer (known as "foosball" in the 
      United States) over the same period and also received the same CACR training. At 
      baseline and after 6 weeks and 3 months, we measured the Global Assessment of 
      Functioning (GAF), Social Adjustment Scale-II (SAS-II), schizophrenia symptoms 
      (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale), and cognitive domains (Verbal Learning 
      Memory Test [VLMT], Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [WCST], and Trail Making Test). 
      After 3 months, we observed a significant improvement in GAF and in SAS-II 
      social/leisure activities and household functioning adaptation in the endurance 
      training augmented with cognitive remediation, but not in the table soccer 
      augmented with cognitive remediation group. The severity of negative symptoms and 
      performance in the VLMT and WCST improved significantly in the schizophrenia 
      endurance training augmented with cognitive remediation group from week 6 to the 
      end of the 3-month training period. Future studies should investigate longer 
      intervention periods to show whether endurance training induces stable 
      improvements in everyday functioning.

TI  - GplusE: beyond genomic selection.
PG  - 25-35
AB  - GplusE is a strategy for genomic selection in which the accuracy of assessment in 
      the reference population for a primary trait such as yield is increased by the 
      incorporation of data from high- throughput field phenotyping platforms. This 
      increase in precision comes from both exploiting genetic relationships between 
      traits and reducing the effect of environmental influences upon them. We describe 
      a collaborative project among researchers and breeders to develop a large 
      reference population of elite UK wheat lines. This will be used to test the 
      method, to study the design of the reference population, and to test genotyping 
      strategies and imputation methods. Finally, it will provide data to pump-prime 
      the application of genomic selection to UK winter wheat breeding.

TI  - The vaginal microbiome during pregnancy and the postpartum period in a European 
      population.
PG  - 8988
LID - 10.1038/srep08988 [doi]
LID - 8988
AB  - The composition and structure of the pregnancy vaginal microbiome may influence 
      susceptibility to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Studies on the pregnant vaginal 
      microbiome have largely been limited to Northern American populations. Using 
      MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, we characterised the vaginal 
      microbiota of a mixed British cohort of women (n = 42) who experienced 
      uncomplicated term delivery and who were sampled longitudinally throughout 
      pregnancy (8-12, 20-22, 28-30 and 34-36 weeks gestation) and 6 weeks postpartum. 
      We show that vaginal microbiome composition dramatically changes postpartum to 
      become less Lactobacillus spp. dominant with increased alpha-diversity 
      irrespective of the community structure during pregnancy and independent of 
      ethnicity. While the pregnancy vaginal microbiome was characteristically 
      dominated by Lactobacillus spp. and low alpha-diversity, unlike Northern American 
      populations, a significant number of pregnant women this British population had a 
      L. jensenii-dominated microbiome characterised by low alpha-diversity. L. 
      jensenii was predominantly observed in women of Asian and Caucasian ethnicity 
      whereas L. gasseri was absent in samples from Black women. This study reveals new 
      insights into biogeographical and ethnic effects upon the pregnancy and 
      postpartum vaginal microbiome and has important implications for future studies 
      exploring relationships between the vaginal microbiome, host health and pregnancy 
      outcomes.

AB  - In the post-GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Scan) era, the interpretation of GWAS 
      results is crucial to screen for highly relevant phenotype-genotype association 
      pairs. Based on the single genotype-phenotype association test and a pathway 
      enrichment analysis, we propose a Metabolite-pathway-based Phenome-Wide 
      Association Scan (M-PheWAS) to analyze the key metabolite-SNP pairs in rice and 
      determine the regulatory relationship by assessing similarities in the changes of 
      enzymes and downstream products in a pathway. Two SNPs, sf0315305925 and 
      sf0315308337, were selected using this approach, and their molecular function and 
      regulatory relationship with Enzyme EC:5.5.1.6 and with flavonoids, a significant 
      downstream regulatory metabolite product, were demonstrated. Moreover, a total of 
      105 crucial SNPs were screened using M-PheWAS, which may be important for 
      metabolite associations.

TI  - Systematic Integration of Brain eQTL and GWAS Identifies ZNF323 as a Novel 
      Schizophrenia Risk Gene and Suggests Recent Positive Selection Based on 
      Compensatory Advantage on Pulmonary Function.
PG  - 1294-308

AB  - Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple risk variants and loci 
      that show robust association with schizophrenia. Nevertheless, it remains unclear 
      how these variants confer risk to schizophrenia. In addition, the driving force 
      that maintains the schizophrenia risk variants in human gene pool is poorly 
      understood. To investigate whether expression-associated genetic variants 
      contribute to schizophrenia susceptibility, we systematically integrated brain 
      expression quantitative trait loci and genome-wide association data of 
      schizophrenia using Sherlock, a Bayesian statistical framework. Our analyses 
      identified ZNF323 as a schizophrenia risk gene (P = 2.22×10(-6)). Subsequent 
      analyses confirmed the association of the ZNF323 and its expression-associated 
      single nucleotide polymorphism rs1150711 in independent samples (gene-expression: 
      P = 1.40×10(-6); single-marker meta-analysis in the combined discovery and 
      replication sample comprising 44123 individuals: P = 6.85×10(-10)). We found that 
      the ZNF323 was significantly downregulated in hippocampus and frontal cortex of 
      schizophrenia patients (P = .0038 and P = .0233, respectively). Evidence for 
      pleiotropic effects was detected (association of rs1150711 with lung function and 
      gene expression of ZNF323 in lung: P = 6.62×10(-5) and P = 9.00×10(-5), 
      respectively) with the risk allele (T allele) for schizophrenia acting as 
      protective allele for lung function. Subsequent population genetics analyses 
      suggest that the risk allele (T) of rs1150711 might have undergone recent 
      positive selection in human population. Our findings suggest that the ZNF323 is a 
      schizophrenia susceptibility gene whose expression may influence schizophrenia 
      risk. Our study also illustrates a possible mechanism for maintaining 
      schizophrenia risk variants in the human gene pool.

AB  - The plant metabolome is the readout of plant physiological status and is regarded 
      as the bridge between the genome and the phenome of plants. Unraveling the 
      natural variation and the underlying genetic basis of plant metabolism has 
      received increasing interest from plant biologists. Enabled by the recent 
      advances in high-throughput profiling and genotyping technologies, 
      metabolite-based genome-wide association study (mGWAS) has emerged as a powerful 
      alternative forward genetics strategy to dissect the genetic and biochemical 
      bases of metabolism in model and crop plants. In this review, recent progress and 
      applications of mGWAS in understanding the genetic control of plant metabolism 
      and in interactive functional genomics and metabolomics are presented. Further 
      directions and perspectives of mGWAS in plants are also discussed.

TI  - Genetic resources offer efficient tools for rice functional genomics research.
PG  - 998-1013
LID - 10.1111/pce.12632 [doi]
AB  - Rice is an important crop and major model plant for monocot functional genomics 
      studies. With the establishment of various genetic resources for rice genomics, 
      the next challenge is to systematically assign functions to predicted genes in 
      the rice genome. Compared with the robustness of genome sequencing and 
      bioinformatics techniques, progress in understanding the function of rice genes 
      has lagged, hampering the utilization of rice genes for cereal crop improvement. 
      The use of transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutagenesis offers the advantage of 
      uniform distribution throughout the rice genome, but preferentially in gene-rich 
      regions, resulting in direct gene knockout or activation of genes within 20-30 kb 
      up- and downstream of the T-DNA insertion site and high gene tagging efficiency. 
      Here, we summarize the recent progress in functional genomics using the 
      T-DNA-tagged rice mutant population. We also discuss important features of T-DNA 
      activation- and knockout-tagging and promoter-trapping of the rice genome in 
      relation to mutant and candidate gene characterizations and how to more 
      efficiently utilize rice mutant populations and datasets for high-throughput 
      functional genomics and phenomics studies by forward and reverse genetics 
      approaches. These studies may facilitate the translation of rice functional 
      genomics research to improvements of rice and other cereal crops.

PG  - 348-54

AB  - Genetic and environmental factors interact throughout life and give rise to 
      individual differences, i.e., individuality. The diversifying effect of 
      environmental factors is counteracted by genetic mechanisms to yield persistence 
      of specific features (robustness). Here, we compared robustness between cohorts 
      of isogenic mice of eight different commonly used strains by analyzing to what 
      extent environmental variation contributed to individuality in each of the eight 
      genotypes, using a previously published dataset. Behavior was assessed in the 
      home-cage, providing control over environmental factors, to reveal within-strain 
      variability in numerous spontaneous behaviors. Indeed, despite standardization 
      and in line with previous studies, substantial variability among mice of the same 
      inbred strain was observed. Strikingly, across a multidimensional set of 115 
      behavioral parameters, several strains consistently ranked high in within-strain 
      variability (DBA/2J, 129S1/Sv A/J and NOD/LtJ), whereas other strains ranked low 
      (C57BL/6J and BALB/c). Strain rankings of within-strain variability in behavior 
      were confirmed in an independent, previously published behavioral dataset using 
      conventional behavioral tests administered to different mice from the same 
      breeding colonies. Together, these show that genetically inbred mouse strains 
      consistently differ in phenotypic robustness against environmental variation, 
      suggesting that genetic factors contribute to variation in robustness.

TI  - Breeding blueberries for a changing global environment: a review.
PG  - 782

AB  - Today, blueberries are recognized worldwide as one of the foremost health foods, 
      becoming one of the crops with the highest productive and commercial projections. 
      Over the last 100 years, the geographical area where highbush blueberries are 
      grown has extended dramatically into hotter and drier environments. The expansion 
      of highbush blueberry growing into warmer regions will be challenged in the 
      future by increases in average global temperature and extreme fluctuations in 
      temperature and rainfall patterns. Considerable genetic variability exists within 
      the blueberry gene pool that breeders can use to meet these challenges, but 
      traditional selection techniques can be slow and inefficient and the precise 
      adaptations of genotypes often remain hidden. Marker assisted breeding (MAB) and 
      phenomics could aid greatly in identifying those individuals carrying 
      adventitious traits, increasing selection efficiency and shortening the rate of 
      cultivar release. While phenomics have begun to be used in the breeding of grain 
      crops in the last 10 years, their use in fruit breeding programs it is almost 
      non-existent.

TI  - Characteristics of Plant Essential Genes Allow for within- and between-Species 
      Prediction of Lethal Mutant Phenotypes.
PG  - 2133-47
LID - 10.1105/tpc.15.00051 [doi]
AB  - Essential genes represent critical cellular components whose disruption results 
      in lethality. Characteristics shared among essential genes have been uncovered in 
      fungal and metazoan model systems. However, features associated with plant 
      essential genes are largely unknown and the full set of essential genes remains 
      to be discovered in any plant species. Here, we show that essential genes in 
      Arabidopsis thaliana have distinct features useful for constructing within- and 
      cross-species prediction models. Essential genes in A. thaliana are often single 
      copy or derived from older duplications, highly and broadly expressed, slow 
      evolving, and highly connected within molecular networks compared with genes with 
      nonlethal mutant phenotypes. These gene features allowed the application of 
      machine learning methods that predicted known lethal genes as well as an 
      additional 1970 likely essential genes without documented phenotypes. Prediction 
      models from A. thaliana could also be applied to predict Oryza sativa and 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae essential genes. Importantly, successful predictions 
      drew upon many features, while any single feature was not sufficient. Our 
      findings show that essential genes can be distinguished from genes with nonlethal 
      phenotypes using features that are similar across kingdoms and indicate the 
      possibility for translational application of our approach to species without 
      extensive functional genomic and phenomic resources.

AB  - Advanced platforms have recently become available for automatic and systematic 
      quantification of plant growth and development. These new techniques can 
      efficiently produce multiple measurements of phenotypes over time, and introduce 
      time as an extra dimension to quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies. Functional 
      mapping utilizes a class of statistical models for identifying QTLs associated 
      with the growth characteristics of interest. A major benefit of functional 
      mapping is that it integrates information over multiple timepoints, and therefore 
      could increase the statistical power for QTL detection. We review the current 
      development of computationally efficient functional mapping methods which provide 
      invaluable tools for analyzing large-scale timecourse data that are readily 
      available in our post-genome era.

TI  - Convergent Lines of Evidence Support LRP8 as a Susceptibility Gene for Psychosis.
PG  - 6608-6619
AB  - Reelin (RELN) is identified as a risk gene for major psychiatric disorders such 
      as schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD). However, the role of its 
      downstream signaling molecule, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related 
      protein 8 (LRP8) in these illnesses is still unclear. To detect whether LRP8 is a 
      susceptibility gene for SCZ and BPD, we analyzed the associations of single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LRP8 in a total of 47,187 subjects (including 
      9379 SCZ patients; 6990 BPD patients; and 12,556 controls in a screening sample, 
      and 1397 SCZ families, 3947 BPD patients, and 8387 controls in independent 
      replications), and identified a non-synonymous SNP rs5174 in LRP8 significantly 
      associated with SCZ and BPD as well as the combined psychosis phenotype (P 
      (meta) = 1.99 × 10(-5), odds ratio (OR) = 1.066, 95 % confidence interval 
      (CI) = 1.035-1.098). The risk SNP rs5174 was also associated with LRP8 messenger 
      RNA (mRNA) expression in multiple brain tissues across independent samples 
      (lowest P = 0.00005). Further exploratory analysis revealed that LRP8 was 
      preferentially expressed in fetal brain tissues. Protein-protein interaction 
      (PPI) analysis demonstrated that LRP8 significantly participated in a highly 
      interconnected PPI network build by top risk genes for SCZ and BPD 
      (P = 7.0 × 10(-4)). Collectively, we confirmed that LRP8 is a risk gene for 
      psychosis, and our results provide useful information toward a better 
      understanding of genetic mechanism involving LRP8 underlying risk of complex 
      psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Computational drug repositioning or repurposing is a promising and efficient tool 
      for discovering new uses from existing drugs and holds the great potential for 
      precision medicine in the age of big data. The explosive growth of large-scale 
      genomic and phenotypic data, as well as data of small molecular compounds with 
      granted regulatory approval, is enabling new developments for computational 
      repositioning. To achieve the shortest path toward new drug indications, advanced 
      data processing and analysis strategies are critical for making sense of these 
      heterogeneous molecular measurements. In this review, we show recent advancements 
      in the critical areas of computational drug repositioning from multiple aspects. 
      First, we summarize available data sources and the corresponding computational 
      repositioning strategies. Second, we characterize the commonly used computational 
      techniques. Third, we discuss validation strategies for repositioning studies, 
      including both computational and experimental methods. Finally, we highlight 
      potential opportunities and use-cases, including a few target areas such as 
      cancers. We conclude with a brief discussion of the remaining challenges in 
      computational drug repositioning.

AB  - Male infertility affects at least 5% of reproductive age males. The most common 
      pathology is a complex presentation of decreased sperm output and abnormal sperm 
      shape and motility referred to as oligoasthenoteratospermia (OAT). For the 
      majority of OAT men a precise diagnosis cannot be provided. Here we demonstrate 
      that leucine-rich repeats and guanylate kinase-domain containing isoform 1 
      (LRGUK-1) is required for multiple aspects of sperm assembly, including acrosome 
      attachment, sperm head shaping and the initiation of the axoneme growth to form 
      the core of the sperm tail. Specifically, LRGUK-1 is required for basal body 
      attachment to the plasma membrane, the appropriate formation of the sub-distal 
      appendages, the extension of axoneme microtubules and for microtubule movement 
      and organisation within the manchette. Manchette dysfunction leads to abnormal 
      sperm head shaping. Several of these functions may be achieved in association 
      with the LRGUK-1 binding partner HOOK2. Collectively, these data establish 
      LRGUK-1 as a major determinant of microtubule structure within the male germ 
      line.

AB  - • PREMISE OF THE STUDY: While numerous software packages enable scientists to 
      evaluate molecular data and transform them for phylogenetic analyses, few such 
      tools exist for phenomic data. We introduce MatrixConverter, a program that helps 
      expedite and facilitate the transformation of raw phenomic character data into 
      discrete character matrices that can be used in most evolutionary inference 
      programs. • METHODS AND RESULTS: MatrixConverter is an open source program 
      written in Java; a platform-independent binary executable, as well as sample data 
      sets and a user's manual, are available at 
      https://github.com/gburleigh/MatrixConverter/tree/master/distribution. 
      MatrixConverter has a simple, intuitive user interface that enables the user to 
      immediately begin scoring phenomic characters. We demonstrate the performance of 
      MatrixConverter on a phenomic data set from cycads. • CONCLUSIONS: New 
      technologies and software make it possible to obtain phenomic data from species 
      across the tree of life, and MatrixConverter helps to transform these new data 
      for evolutionary or ecological inference.

AB  - The temperate-tropical division of early maize germplasms to different 
      agricultural environments was arguably the greatest adaptation process associated 
      with the success and near ubiquitous importance of global maize production. 
      Deciphering this history is challenging, but new insight has been gained from 
      examining 558 529 single nucleotide polymorphisms, expression data of 28 769 
      genes, and 662 traits collected from 368 diverse temperate and tropical maize 
      inbred lines in this study. This is a new attempt to systematically exploit the 
      mechanisms of the adaptation process in maize. Our results indicate that 
      divergence between tropical and temperate lines apparently occurred 3400-6700 
      years ago. Seven hundred and one genomic selection signals and transcriptomic 
      variants including 2700 differentially expressed individual genes and 389 rewired 
      co-expression network genes were identified. These candidate signals were found 
      to be functionally related to stress responses, and most were associated with 
      directionally selected traits, which may have been an advantage under widely 
      varying environmental conditions faced by maize as it was migrated away from its 
      domestication center. Our study also clearly indicates that such stress 
      adaptation could involve evolution of protein-coding sequences as well as 
      transcriptome-level regulatory changes. The latter process may be a more flexible 
      and dynamic way for maize to adapt to environmental changes along its short 
      evolutionary history.

AB  - To coordinate research efforts in psychiatric genetics in China, a group of 
      Chinese and foreign investigators have established an annual “Summit on Chinese 
      Psychiatric Genetics” to present their latest research and discuss the current 
      state and future directions of this field. To date, two Summits have been held, 
      the first in Changsha in April, 2014, and the second in Kunming in April, 2015. 
      The consensus of roundtable discussions held at these meetings is that 
      psychiatric genetics in China is in need of new policies to promote 
      collaborations aimed at creating a framework for genetic research appropriate for 
      the Chinese population: relying solely on Caucasian population-based studies may 
      result in missed opportunities to diagnose and treat psychiatric disorders. In 
      addition, participants agree on the importance of promoting collaborations and 
      data sharing in areas where China has especially strong resources, such as 
      advanced facilities for non-human primate studies and traditional Chinese 
      medicine: areas that may also provide overseas investigators with unique research 
      opportunities. In this paper, we present an overview of the current state of 
      psychiatric genetics research in China, with emphasis on genome-level studies, 
      and describe challenges and opportunities for future advances, particularly at 
      the dawn of “precision medicine.” Together, we call on administrative bodies, 
      funding agencies, the research community, and the public at large for increased 
      support for research on the genetic basis of psychiatric disorders in the Chinese 
      population. In our opinion, increased public awareness and effective 
      collaborative research hold the keys to the future of psychiatric genetics in 
      China.

AB  - piRNAs are critical for transposable element (TE) repression and germ cell 
      survival during the early phases of spermatogenesis, however, their role in adult 
      germ cells and the relative importance of piRNA methylation is poorly defined in 
      mammals. Using a mouse model of HEN methyltransferase 1 (HENMT1) 
      loss-of-function, RNA-Seq and a range of RNA assays we show that HENMT1 is 
      required for the 2' O-methylation of mammalian piRNAs. HENMT1 loss leads to piRNA 
      instability, reduced piRNA bulk and length, and ultimately male sterility 
      characterized by a germ cell arrest at the elongating germ cell phase of 
      spermatogenesis. HENMT1 loss-of-function, and the concomitant loss of piRNAs, 
      resulted in TE de-repression in adult meiotic and haploid germ cells, and the 
      precocious, and selective, expression of many haploid-transcripts in meiotic 
      cells. Precocious expression was associated with a more active chromatin state in 
      meiotic cells, elevated levels of DNA damage and a catastrophic deregulation of 
      the haploid germ cell gene expression. Collectively these results define a 
      critical role for HENMT1 and piRNAs in the maintenance of TE repression in adult 
      germ cells and setting the spermatogenic program.

      genome-wide assessment of mice.
PG  - 4707-12
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1415046112 [doi]
AB  - High-throughput gene expression profiling has revealed substantial leaky and 
      extraneous transcription of eukaryotic genes, challenging the perceptions that 
      transcription is strictly regulated and that changes in transcription have 
      phenotypic consequences. To assess the functional implications of mRNA 
      transcription directly, we analyzed mRNA expression data derived from 
      microarrays, RNA-sequencing, and in situ hybridization, together with phenotype 
      data of mouse mutants as a proxy of gene function at the tissue level. The 
      results indicated that despite the presence of widespread ectopic transcription, 
      mRNA expression and mutant phenotypes of mammalian genes or tissues remain 
      associated. The expression-phenotype association at the gene level was 
      particularly strong for tissue-specific genes, and the association could be 
      underestimated due to data insufficiency and incomprehensive phenotyping of mouse 
      mutants; the strength of expression-phenotype association at the tissue level 
      depended on tissue functions. Mutations on genes expressed at higher levels or 
      expressed at earlier embryonic stages more often result in abnormal phenotypes in 
      the tissues where they are expressed. The mRNA expression profiles that have 
      stronger associations with their phenotype profiles tend to be more 
      evolutionarily conserved, indicating that the evolution of transcriptome and the 
      evolution of phenome are coupled. Therefore, mutations resulting in phenotypic 
      aberrations in expressed tissues are more likely to occur in highly transcribed 
      genes, tissue-specific genes, genes expressed during early embryonic stages, or 
      genes with evolutionarily conserved mRNA expression profiles.

TI  - Remodeling of intermediate metabolism in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum 
      under nitrogen stress.
PG  - 412-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1419818112 [doi]
AB  - Diatoms are unicellular algae that accumulate significant amounts of 
      triacylglycerols as storage lipids when their growth is limited by nutrients. 
      Using biochemical, physiological, bioinformatics, and reverse genetic approaches, 
      we analyzed how the flux of carbon into lipids is influenced by nitrogen stress 
      in a model diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Our results reveal that the 
      accumulation of lipids is a consequence of remodeling of intermediate metabolism, 
      especially reactions in the tricarboxylic acid and the urea cycles. Specifically, 
      approximately one-half of the cellular proteins are cannibalized; whereas the 
      nitrogen is scavenged by the urea and glutamine synthetase/glutamine 
      2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase pathways and redirected to the de novo synthesis 
      of nitrogen assimilation machinery, simultaneously, the photobiological flux of 
      carbon and reductants is used to synthesize lipids. To further examine how 
      nitrogen stress triggers the remodeling process, we knocked down the gene 
      encoding for nitrate reductase, a key enzyme required for the assimilation of 
      nitrate. The strain exhibits 40-50% of the mRNA copy numbers, protein content, 
      and enzymatic activity of the wild type, concomitant with a 43% increase in 
      cellular lipid content. We suggest a negative feedback sensor that couples 
      photosynthetic carbon fixation to lipid biosynthesis and is regulated by the 
      nitrogen assimilation pathway. This metabolic feedback enables diatoms to rapidly 
      respond to fluctuations in environmental nitrogen availability.

TI  - Cryopreserved Interleukin-4-Treated Macrophages Attenuate Murine Colitis in an 
      Integrin β7 - Dependent Manner.
PG  - 924-936
LID - 10.2119/molmed.2015.00193 [doi]
AB  - The adoptive transfer of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) has proven to 
      attenuate inflammation in multiple mouse models of colitis; however, the effect 
      of cryopreservation on AAMs, the ability of previously frozen AAMs to block 
      dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS) (Th1) and oxazolone (Th2) colitis and their 
      migration postinjection remains unknown. Here we have found that while 
      cryopreservation reduced mRNA expression of canonical markers of interleukin 
      (IL)-4-treated macrophages [M(IL-4)], this step did not translate to reduced 
      protein or activity, and the cells retained their capacity to drive the 
      suppression of colitis. The anticolitic effect of M(IL-4) adoptive transfer 
      required neither T or B cell nor peritoneal macrophages in the recipient. After 
      injection into the peritoneal cavity, M(IL-4)s migrated to the spleen, mesenteric 
      lymph nodes and colon of DNBS-treated mice. The chemokines CCL2, CCL4 and CX3CL1 
      were expressed in the colon during the course of DNBS-induced colitis. The 
      expression of integrin β7 on transferred M(IL-4)s was required for their 
      anticolitic effect, whereas the presence of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and 
      CX3CR1 were dispensable in this model. Collectively, the data show that M(IL-4)s 
      can be cryopreserved M(IL-4)s and subsequently used to suppress colitis in an 
      integrin β7-dependent manner, and we suggest that these proof-of-concept studies 
      may lead to new cellular therapies for human inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Contrasting Association Results between Existing PheWAS Phenotype Definition 
      Methods and Five Validated Electronic Phenotypes.
PG  - 824-32
AB  - Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) comprehensively investigate the 
      association between genetic variation and a wide array of outcome traits. 
      Electronic health record (EHR) based PheWAS uses various abstractions of 
      International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes to 
      identify case/control status for diagnoses that are used as the phenotypic 
      variables. However, there have not been comparisons within a PheWAS between 
      results from high quality derived phenotypes and high-throughput but potentially 
      inaccurate use of ICD-9 codes for case/control definition. For this study we 
      first developed a group of high quality algorithms for five phenotypes. Next we 
      evaluated the association of these "gold standard" phenotypes and 4,636,178 
      genetic variants with minor allele frequency > 0.01 and compared the results from 
      high-throughput associations at the 3 digit, 5 digit, and PheWAS codes for 
      defining case/control status. We found that certain diseases contained similar 
      patient populations across phenotyping methods but had differences in PheWAS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder. Over the years, different 
      approaches have been proposed to approach this heterogeneity by categorizing 
      symptom patterns. The study aimed to compare positive/negative and 
      system-specific approaches to subtyping. METHODS: We used the Positive and 
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Bern Psychopathology Scale (BPS), which 
      consists of subscales for three domains (language, affect and motor behavior) 
      that are hypothesized to be related to specific brain circuits, to assess 
      cross-sectional psychopathological characteristics in a sample of 100 inpatients 
      with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. We then categorized participants into 
      positive/negative and system-specific subgroups to allow comparisons of the two 
      approaches. RESULTS: The analyses revealed correlations between the PANSS 
      positive subscore and the BPS affective subscore (r=.446, p<.001) and between the 
      PANSS negative subscore and the BPS motor behavior subscore (r=.227, p=.023). As 
      regards the positive and negative subtype, more participants were classified as 
      positive in the language-dominant subtype (30.3%) and affect-dominant subtype 
      (30.3%), whereas more were classified as negative in the motor behavior-dominant 
      subtype (44.4%). However, most patients met the criteria for the mixed subtype. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the positive/negative and system-specific 
      approaches can be regarded as complementary. Future studies should examine both 
      approaches in a longitudinal assessment of psychopathological symptoms and link 
      them with qualitative-phenomenological approaches.

AB  - The rapid progress in genome sequencing and transcriptome analysis in model and 
      crop plants has made possible the identification of a vast number of genes 
      potentially associated with economically important complex traits. The ultimate 
      goal is to assign functions to these genes by using forward and reverse genetic 
      screens. Plant viruses have been developed for virus-induced gene silencing 
      (VIGS) to generate rapid gene knockdown phenotypes in numerous plant species. To 
      fulfill its potential for high-throughput phenomics, it is of prime importance to 
      ensure that parameters conditioning the VIGS response, i.e., plant-virus 
      interactions and associated loss-of-function screens, are "fit for purpose" and 
      optimized to unequivocally conclude the role of a gene of interest in relation to 
      a given trait. This chapter will review and discuss the different strategies used 
      for the development of VIGS-based phenomics in model and crop species.

AB  - Understanding of the avian male gamete biology is essential to improve the 
      conservation of genetic resources and performance in farming. In this study, the 
      chicken semen peptidome/proteome and the molecular phenotype related to sperm 
      quality were investigated. Spermatozoa (SPZ) and corresponding seminal plasma 
      (SP) from 11 males with different fertilizing capacity were analyzed using three 
      quantitative strategies (fluid and intact cells MALDI-MS, SDS-PAGE combined to 
      LC-MS/MS with spectral counting and XIC methods). Individual MALDI profiling in 
      combination with top-down MS allowed to characterize specific profiles per male 
      and to identify 16 biomolecules (e.g.VMO1, AvBD10 and AvBD9 including 
      polymorphism). Qualitative analysis identified 1165 proteins mainly involved in 
      oxidoreduction mechanisms, energy processes, proteolysis and protein 
      localization. Comparative analyses between the most and the least fertile males 
      were performed. The enzymes involved in energy metabolism, respiratory chain or 
      oxido-reduction activity were over-represented in SPZ of the most fertile males. 
      The SP of the most and the least fertile males differed also on many proteins 
      (e.g. ACE, AvBD10 and AvBD9, NEL precursor, acrosin). Thus proteomic is a 
      "phenomic molecular tool" that may help to discriminate avian males on their 
      reproductive capacity. The data have been deposited with ProteomeXchange 
      (identifiers PXD000287 and PXD001254). BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This peptidomic 
      and proteomic study i) characterized for the first time the semen protein 
      composition of the main domestic avian species (Gallus gallus) by analysis of 
      ejaculated spermatozoa and corresponding seminal plasma; ii) established a 
      characteristic molecular phenotype distinguishing semen and males at an 
      individual level; and iii) proposedthe first evidence of biomarkers related to 
      fertility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An objective and automated method for assessing alterations in gait 
      and motor coordination in different animal models is important for proper gait 
      analysis. The CatWalk system has been used in pain research, ischemia, arthritis, 
      spinal cord injury and some animal models for neurodegenerative diseases. NEW 
      METHOD: Our goals were to obtain a comprehensive gait analysis of three different 
      rat models and to identify which motor coordination parameters are affected and 
      are the most suitable and sensitive to describe and detect ataxia with a 
      secondary focus on possible training effects. RESULTS: Both static and dynamic 
      parameters showed significant differences in all three models: enriched housed 
      rats show higher walking and swing speed and longer stride length, 
      ethanol-induced ataxia affects mainly the hind part of the body, and the SCA17 
      rats show coordination disturbances. Coordination changes were revealed only in 
      the case of the ethanol-induced ataxia and the SCA17 rat model. Although training 
      affected some gait parameters, it did not obscure group differences when those 
      were present. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: To our knowledge, a comparative 
      gait assessment in rats with enriched housing conditions, ethanol-induced ataxia 
      and SCA17 has not been presented before. CONCLUSIONS: There is no gold standard 
      for the use of CatWalk. Dependent on the specific effects expected, the protocol 
      can be adjusted. By including all sessions in the analysis, any training effect 
      should be detectable and the development of the performance over the sessions can 
      provide insight in effects attributed to intervention, treatment or injury.

TI  - Comparative functional pan-genome analyses to build connections between genomic 
      dynamics and phenotypic evolution in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism 
      in the genus Mycobacterium.
PG  - 21

AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial genus Mycobacterium is of great interest in the medical 
      and biotechnological fields. Despite a flood of genome sequencing and functional 
      genomics data, significant gaps in knowledge between genome and phenome seriously 
      hinder efforts toward the treatment of mycobacterial diseases and practical 
      biotechnological applications. In this study, we propose the use of systematic, 
      comparative functional pan-genomic analysis to build connections between genomic 
      dynamics and phenotypic evolution in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 
      metabolism in the genus Mycobacterium. RESULTS: Phylogenetic, phenotypic, and 
      genomic information for 27 completely genome-sequenced mycobacteria was 
      systematically integrated to reconstruct a mycobacterial phenotype network (MPN) 
      with a pan-genomic concept at a network level. In the MPN, mycobacterial 
      phenotypes show typical scale-free relationships. PAH degradation is an isolated 
      phenotype with the lowest connection degree, consistent with phylogenetic and 
      environmental isolation of PAH degraders. A series of functional pan-genomic 
      analyses provide conserved and unique types of genomic evidence for strong 
      epistatic and pleiotropic impacts on evolutionary trajectories of the 
      PAH-degrading phenotype. Under strong natural selection, the detailed gene 
      gain/loss patterns from horizontal gene transfer (HGT)/deletion events 
      hypothesize a plausible evolutionary path, an epistasis-based birth and 
      pleiotropy-dependent death, for PAH metabolism in the genus Mycobacterium. This 
      study generated a practical mycobacterial compendium of phenotypic and genomic 
      changes, focusing on the PAH-degrading phenotype, with a pan-genomic perspective 
      of the evolutionary events and the environmental challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings suggest that when selection acts on PAH metabolism, only a small 
      fraction of possible trajectories is likely to be observed, owing mainly to a 
      combination of the ambiguous phenotypic effects of PAHs and the corresponding 
      pleiotropy- and epistasis-dependent evolutionary adaptation. Evolutionary 
      constraints on the selection of trajectories, like those seen in PAH-degrading 
      phenotypes, are likely to apply to the evolution of other phenotypes in the genus 
      Mycobacterium.

PG  - 249-70
LID - 10.1007/978-3-319-10984-8_14 [doi]
AB  - Here we present a complete system for 3D reconstruction of roots grown in a 
      transparent gel medium or washed and suspended in water. The system is capable of 
      being fully automated as it is self calibrating. The system starts with detection 
      of root tips in root images from an image sequence generated by a turntable 
      motion. Root tips are detected using the statistics of Zernike moments on image 
      patches centred on high curvature points on root boundary and Bayes 
      classification rule. The detected root tips are tracked in the image sequence 
      using a multi-target tracking algorithm. Conics are fitted to the root tip 
      trajectories using a novel ellipse fitting algorithm which weighs the data points 
      by its eccentricity. The conics projected from the circular trajectory have a 
      complex conjugate intersection which are image of the circular points. Circular 
      points constraint the image of the absolute conics which are directly related to 
      the internal parameters of the camera. The pose of the camera is computed from 
      the image of the rotation axis and the horizon. The silhouettes of the roots and 
      camera parameters are used to reconstruction the 3D voxel model of the roots. We 
      show the results of real 3D reconstruction of roots which are detailed and 
      realistic for phenotypic analysis.

PG  - 1188-93
LID - 10.1038/mp.2015.126 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide polygenic scores (GPS), which aggregate the effects of thousands of 
      DNA variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have the potential to 
      make genetic predictions for individuals. We conducted a systematic investigation 
      of associations between GPS and many behavioral traits, the behavioral phenome. 
      For 3152 unrelated 16-year-old individuals representative of the United Kingdom, 
      we created 13 GPS from the largest GWAS for psychiatric disorders (for example, 
      schizophrenia, depression and dementia) and cognitive traits (for example, 
      intelligence, educational attainment and intracranial volume). The behavioral 
      phenome included 50 traits from the domains of psychopathology, personality, 
      cognitive abilities and educational achievement. We examined phenome-wide 
      profiles of associations for the entire distribution of each GPS and for the 
      extremes of the GPS distributions. The cognitive GPS yielded stronger predictive 
      power than the psychiatric GPS in our UK-representative sample of adolescents. 
      For example, education GPS explained variation in adolescents' behavior problems 
      (~0.6%) and in educational achievement (~2%) but psychiatric GPS were associated 
      with neither. Despite the modest effect sizes of current GPS, quantile analyses 
      illustrate the ability to stratify individuals by GPS and opportunities for 
      research. For example, the highest and lowest septiles for the education GPS 
      yielded a 0.5 s.d. difference in mean math grade and a 0.25 s.d. difference in 
      mean behavior problems. We discuss the usefulness and limitations of GPS based on 
      adult GWAS to predict genetic propensities earlier in development.

LID - 10.1093/jxb/erv271 [doi]
AB  - Recent methodological developments in plant phenotyping, as well as the growing 
      importance of its applications in plant science and breeding, are resulting in a 
      fast accumulation of multidimensional data. There is great potential for 
      expediting both discovery and application if these data are made publicly 
      available for analysis. However, collection and storage of phenotypic 
      observations is not yet sufficiently governed by standards that would ensure 
      interoperability among data providers and precisely link specific phenotypes and 
      associated genomic sequence information. This lack of standards is mainly a 
      result of a large variability of phenotyping protocols, the multitude of 
      phenotypic traits that are measured, and the dependence of these traits on the 
      environment. This paper discusses the current situation of standardization in the 
      area of phenomics, points out the problems and shortages, and presents the areas 
      that would benefit from improvement in this field. In addition, the foundations 
      of the work that could revise the situation are proposed, and practical solutions 
      developed by the authors are introduced.

AB  - Glucocorticoid treatment reportedly increases the morbidity of osteoporotic or 
      osteonecrotic disorders. Exacerbated bone acquisition and escalated marrow 
      adipogenesis are prominent pathological features of glucocorticoid-mediated 
      skeletal disorders. MicroRNAs reportedly modulate tissue metabolism and 
      remodeling. This study was undertaken to investigate the biological roles of 
      microRNA-29a (miR-29a) in skeletal and fat metabolism in the pathogenesis of 
      glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Transgenic mice overexpressing miR-29a 
      precursor or wild-type mice were given methylprednisolone. Bone mass, 
      microarchitecture and histology were assessed by dual energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry, μCT and histomorphometry. Differential gene expression and 
      signaling components were delineated by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting. 
      Glucocorticoid treatment accelerated bone loss and marrow fat accumulation in 
      association with decreased miR-29a expression. The miR-29a transgenic mice had 
      high bone mineral density, trabecular microarchitecture and cortical thickness. 
      miR-29a overexpression mitigated the glucocorticoid-induced impediment of bone 
      mass, skeletal microstructure integrity and mineralization reaction and 
      attenuated fatty marrow histopathology. Ex vivo, miR-29a increased osteogenic 
      differentiation capacity and alleviated the glucocorticoid-induced promotion of 
      adipocyte formation in primary bone-marrow mesenchymal progenitor cell cultures. 
      Through inhibition of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) expression, miR-29a restored 
      acetylated Runx2 and β-catenin abundances and reduced RANKL, leptin and 
      glucocorticoid receptor expression in glucocorticoid-mediated osteoporosis bone 
      tissues. Taken together, glucocorticoid suppression of miR-29a signaling 
      disturbed the balances between osteogenic and adipogenic activities, and thereby 
      interrupted bone formation and skeletal homeostasis. miR-29a inhibition of HDAC4 
      stabilized the acetylation state of Runx2 and β-catenin that ameliorated the 
      detrimental effects of glucocorticoid on mineralization and lipogenesis reactions 
      in bone tissue microenvironments. This study highlighted emerging 
      skeletal-anabolic actions of miR-29a signaling in the progression of 
      glucocorticoid-induced bone tissue destruction. Sustaining miR-29a actions is 
      beneficial in protecting against glucocorticoid-mediated osteoporosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant breeding and genetics demand fast, exact and reproducible 
      phenotyping. Efficient statistical evaluation of phenotyping data requires 
      standardised data storage ensuring long-term data availability while maintaining 
      intellectual property rights. This is state of the art at phenomics centres, 
      which, however, are unavailable for most scientists. For them we developed a 
      simple and cost-efficient system, the Phenotyper, which employs mobile devices or 
      personal digital assistants (PDA) for on-site data entry and open-source software 
      for data management. RESULTS: A graphical user interface (GUI) on a PDA replaces 
      paper-based form sheet and data entry on a desktop. The user can define his 
      phenotyping schemes in a web tool without in-depth knowledge of the system and 
      thus adjust it more easily to new research aspects than in a classical laboratory 
      information management system (LIMS). In the Phenotyper, schemes are built from 
      controlled vocabulary gained from published ontologies. Vocabulary and schemes 
      are stored in a database that also manages the user access. From the web page, 
      schemes are downloaded as extended markup language (XML) files for the transfer 
      to the PDA and the exchange between users. On the PDA, the GUI displays the 
      schemes and stores data in comma separated value format and XML format. After 
      manual quality control, data are uploaded via a web page to an independently 
      hosted results database, in which data are stored in an entity-attribute-value 
      structure to provide maximum flexibility. Datasets are linked to the original and 
      curated data files stored on a file server. The ownership stamp, project 
      affiliation and date stamp of a dataset are used to regulate data access, which 
      is restricted to data belonging to the user or to his projects and data, for 
      which the embargo period has ended. By export of standardised ASCII reports to 
      long-term data storage facility, long-term accessibility allows searching, citing 
      and use of raw data beyond the lifetime of the database. The Phenotyper is 
      available to the scientific community for use and further development. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The Phenotyper provides a well-structured, but flexible data 
      acquisition and management structure for mobile on-site measurements for 
      efficient evaluation and shared use of data.

TI  - Transcriptional repression by MYB3R proteins regulates plant organ growth.
PG  - 1992-2007
LID - 10.15252/embj.201490899 [doi]
AB  - In multicellular organisms, temporal and spatial regulation of cell proliferation 
      is central for generating organs with defined sizes and morphologies. For 
      establishing and maintaining the post-mitotic quiescent state during cell 
      differentiation, it is important to repress genes with mitotic functions. We 
      found that three of the Arabidopsis MYB3R transcription factors synergistically 
      maintain G2/M-specific genes repressed in post-mitotic cells and restrict the 
      time window of mitotic gene expression in proliferating cells. The combined 
      mutants of the three repressor-type MYB3R genes displayed long roots, enlarged 
      leaves, embryos, and seeds. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed 
      that MYB3R3 binds to the promoters of G2/M-specific genes and to E2F target 
      genes. MYB3R3 associates with the repressor-type E2F, E2FC, and the 
      RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED proteins. In contrast, the activator MYB3R4 was in complex 
      with E2FB in proliferating cells. With mass spectrometry and pairwise interaction 
      assays, we identified some of the other conserved components of the multiprotein 
      complexes, known as DREAM/dREAM in human and flies. In plants, these repressor 
      complexes are important for periodic expression during cell cycle and to 
      establish a post-mitotic quiescent state determining organ size.

TI  - Integrative phenotyping framework (iPF): integrative clustering of multiple omics 
      data identifies novel lung disease subphenotypes.
PG  - 924
LID - 10.1186/s12864-015-2170-4 [doi]
LID - 924
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increased multi-omics information on carefully phenotyped 
      patients in studies of complex diseases requires novel methods for data 
      integration. Unlike continuous intensity measurements from most omics data sets, 
      phenome data contain clinical variables that are binary, ordinal and categorical. 
      RESULTS: In this paper we introduce an integrative phenotyping framework (iPF) 
      for disease subtype discovery. A feature topology plot was developed for 
      effective dimension reduction and visualization of multi-omics data. The approach 
      is free of model assumption and robust to data noises or missingness. We 
      developed a workflow to integrate homogeneous patient clustering from different 
      omics data in an agglomerative manner and then visualized heterogeneous 
      clustering of pairwise omics sources. We applied the framework to two batches of 
      lung samples obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive lung 
      disease (COPD) or interstitial lung disease (ILD) with well-characterized 
      clinical (phenomic) data, mRNA and microRNA expression profiles. Application of 
      iPF to the first training batch identified clusters of patients consisting of 
      homogenous disease phenotypes as well as clusters with intermediate disease 
      characteristics. Analysis of the second batch revealed a similar data structure, 
      confirming the presence of intermediate clusters. Genes in the intermediate 
      clusters were enriched with inflammatory and immune functional annotations, 
      suggesting that they represent mechanistically distinct disease subphenotypes 
      that may response to immunomodulatory therapies. The iPF software package and all 
      source codes are publicly available. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of subclusters 
      with distinct clinical and biomolecular characteristics suggests that integration 
      of phenomic and other omics information could lead to identification of novel 
      mechanism-based disease sub-phenotypes.

TI  - MOST: a software environment for constraint-based metabolic modeling and strain 
      design.
PG  - 610-1
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu685 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: MOST (metabolic optimization and simulation tool) is a software package 
      that implements GDBB (genetic design through branch and bound) in an intuitive 
      user-friendly interface with excel-like editing functionality, as well as 
      implementing FBA (flux balance analysis), and supporting systems biology markup 
      language and comma-separated values files. GDBB is currently the fastest 
      algorithm for finding gene knockouts predicted by FBA to increase production of 
      desired products, but GDBB has only been available on a command line interface, 
      which is difficult to use for those without programming knowledge, until the 
      release of MOST. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MOST is distributed for free on 
      the GNU General Public License. The software and full documentation are available 
      at http://most.ccib.rutgers.edu/. CONTACT: dslun@rutgers.edu.

TI  - Caspase-11 cleaves gasdermin D for non-canonical inflammasome signalling.
PG  - 666-71
LID - 10.1038/nature15541 [doi]
AB  - Intracellular lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria including 
      Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, and Burkholderia 
      thailandensis activates mouse caspase-11, causing pyroptotic cell death, 
      interleukin-1β processing, and lethal septic shock. How caspase-11 executes these 
      downstream signalling events is largely unknown. Here we show that gasdermin D is 
      essential for caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and interleukin-1β maturation. A 
      forward genetic screen with ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized mice links Gsdmd to 
      the intracellular lipopolysaccharide response. Macrophages from Gsdmd(-/-) mice 
      generated by gene targeting also exhibit defective pyroptosis and interleukin-1β 
      secretion induced by cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharide or Gram-negative bacteria. In 
      addition, Gsdmd(-/-) mice are protected from a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide. 
      Mechanistically, caspase-11 cleaves gasdermin D, and the resulting amino-terminal 
      fragment promotes both pyroptosis and NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase-1 in 
      a cell-intrinsic manner. Our data identify gasdermin D as a critical target of 
      caspase-11 and a key mediator of the host response against Gram-negative 
      bacteria.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable tumor of the plasma cells, the terminally 
      differentiated immunoglobulin secreting B lineage cells. The genetic make-up of 
      MM has been extensively characterized but its impact on the biology of the 
      disease is incomplete without more precise knowledge of the identity and 
      functional role of cells with multiple myeloma propagating activity (MMPA). We 
      review here recent data that link MMPA with myeloma clonotypic populations 
      organized in a cellular hierarchy that mirrors normal B cell development and also 
      with drug resistance and disease relapse. We further propose a conceptual 
      framework which, with optimal use of recent technological advances in genomics 
      and phenomics, could allow dissection of the cellular and molecular properties of 
      cells with MMPA, drug resistance and in vivo relapse in an integrated and 
      patient-specific manner. There is real hope that these approaches will 
      significantly contribute to further improvements in disease control, overall 
      survival, and possibly cure of patients with MM.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly emerging as an important model organism for 
      aquatic neuropharmacology and toxicology research. The behavioral/phenotypic 
      complexity of zebrafish allows for thorough dissection of complex human brain 
      disorders and drug-evoked pathological states. As numerous zebrafish models 
      become available with a wide spectrum of behavioral, genetic, and environmental 
      methods to test novel drugs, here we discuss recent zebrafish phenomics methods 
      to facilitate drug discovery, particularly in the field of biological psychiatry. 
      Additionally, behavioral, neurological, and endocrine endpoints are becoming 
      increasingly well-characterized in zebrafish, making them an inexpensive, robust 
      and effective model for toxicology research and pharmacological screening. We 
      also discuss zebrafish behavioral phenotypes, experimental considerations, 
      pharmacological candidates and relevance of zebrafish neurophenomics to other 
      'omics' (e.g., genomic, proteomic) approaches. Finally, we critically evaluate 
      the limitations of utilizing this model organism, and outline future strategies 
      of research in the field of zebrafish phenomics.

TI  - Variable Responses to Carbon Utilization between Planktonic and Biofilm Cells of 
      a Human Carrier Strain of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhi.
PG  - e0126207

LID - e0126207
AB  - Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is a foodborne pathogen that causes 
      typhoid fever and infects only humans. The ability of S. Typhi to survive outside 
      the human host remains unclear, particularly in human carrier strains. In this 
      study, we have investigated the catabolic activity of a human carrier S. Typhi 
      strain in both planktonic and biofilm cells using the high-throughput Biolog 
      Phenotype MicroArray, Minimum Biofilm Eradication Concentration (MBEC) biofilm 
      inoculator (96-well peg lid) and whole genome sequence data. Additional strains 
      of S. Typhi were tested to further validate the variation of catabolism in 
      selected carbon substrates in the different bacterial growth phases. The analyzes 
      of the carbon utilization data indicated that planktonic cells of the carrier 
      strain, S. Typhi CR0044 could utilize a broader range of carbon substrates 
      compared to biofilm cells. Pyruvic acid and succinic acid which are related to 
      energy metabolism were actively catabolised in the planktonic stage compared to 
      biofilm stage. On the other hand, glycerol, L-fucose, L-rhamnose (carbohydrates) 
      and D-threonine (amino acid) were more actively catabolised by biofilm cells 
      compared to planktonic cells. Notably, dextrin and pectin could induce strong 
      biofilm formation in the human carrier strain of S. Typhi. However, pectin could 
      not induce formation of biofilm in the other S. Typhi strains. Phenome data 
      showed the utilization of certain carbon substrates which was supported by the 
      presence of the catabolism-associated genes in S. Typhi CR0044. In conclusion, 
      the findings showed the differential carbon utilization between planktonic and 
      biofilm cells of a S. Typhi human carrier strain. The differences found in the 
      carbon utilization profiles suggested that S. Typhi uses substrates mainly found 
      in the human biliary mucus glycoprotein, gallbladder, liver and cortex of the 
      kidney of the human host. The observed diversity in the carbon catabolism 
      profiles among different S. Typhi strains has suggested the possible involvement 
      of various metabolic pathways that might be related to the virulence and 
      pathogenesis of this host-restricted human pathogen. The data serve as a caveat 
      for future in-vivo studies to investigate the carbon metabolic activity to the 
      pathogenesis of S. Typhi.

LID - 6757
AB  - Cryptococcus neoformans causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in humans, 
      but its overall biological and pathogenic regulatory circuits remain elusive, 
      particularly due to the presence of an evolutionarily divergent set of 
      transcription factors (TFs). Here, we report the construction of a high-quality 
      library of 322 signature-tagged gene-deletion strains for 155 putative TF genes 
      previously predicted using the DNA-binding domain TF database, and examine their 
      in vitro and in vivo phenotypic traits under 32 distinct growth conditions. At 
      least one phenotypic trait is exhibited by 145 out of 155 TF mutants (93%) and 
      ∼85% of them (132/155) are functionally characterized for the first time in this 
      study. The genotypic and phenotypic data for each TF are available in the C. 
      neoformans TF phenome database (http://tf.cryptococcus.org). In conclusion, our 
      phenome-based functional analysis of the C. neoformans TF mutant library provides 
      key insights into transcriptional networks of basidiomycetous fungi and human 
      fungal pathogens.

TI  - Pinpointing disease genes through phenomic and genomic data fusion.
PG  - S3
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-16-S2-S3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pinpointing genes involved in inherited human diseases remains a 
      great challenge in the post-genomics era. Although approaches have been proposed 
      either based on the guilt-by-association principle or making use of disease 
      phenotype similarities, the low coverage of both diseases and genes in existing 
      methods has been preventing the scan of causative genes for a significant 
      proportion of diseases at the whole-genome level. RESULTS: To overcome this 
      limitation, we proposed a rigorous statistical method called pgFusion to 
      prioritize candidate genes by integrating one type of disease phenotype 
      similarity derived from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and seven 
      types of gene functional similarities calculated from gene expression, gene 
      ontology, pathway membership, protein sequence, protein domain, protein-protein 
      interaction and regulation pattern, respectively. Our method covered a total of 
      7,719 diseases and 20,327 genes, achieving the highest coverage thus far for both 
      diseases and genes. We performed leave-one-out cross-validation experiments to 
      demonstrate the superior performance of our method and applied it to a real exome 
      sequencing dataset of epileptic encephalopathies, showing the capability of this 
      approach in finding causative genes for complex diseases. We further provided the 
      standalone software and online services of pgFusion at 
      http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/jianglab/pgfusion. CONCLUSIONS: pgFusion not 
      only provided an effective way for prioritizing candidate genes, but also 
      demonstrated feasible solutions to two fundamental questions in the analysis of 
      big genomic data: the comparability of heterogeneous data and the integration of 
      multiple types of data. Applications of this method in exome or whole genome 
      sequencing studies would accelerate the finding of causative genes for human 
      diseases. Other research fields in genomics could also benefit from the 
      incorporation of our data fusion methodology.

TI  - Walking on multiple disease-gene networks to prioritize candidate genes.
PG  - 214-30
LID - 10.1093/jmcb/mjv008 [doi]
AB  - Uncovering causal genes for human inherited diseases, as the primary step toward 
      understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases, requires a combined analysis of 
      genetic and genomic data. Although bioinformatics methods have been designed to 
      prioritize candidate genes resulting from genetic linkage analysis or association 
      studies, the coverage of both diseases and genes in existing methods is quite 
      limited, thereby preventing the scan of causal genes for a significant proportion 
      of diseases at the whole-genome level. To overcome this limitation, we propose a 
      method named pgWalk to prioritize candidate genes by integrating multiple 
      phenomic and genomic data. We derive three types of phenotype similarities among 
      7719 diseases and nine types of functional similarities among 20327 genes. Based 
      on a pair of phenotype and gene similarities, we construct a disease-gene network 
      and then simulate the process that a random walker wanders on such a 
      heterogeneous network to quantify the strength of association between a candidate 
      gene and a query disease. A weighted version of the Fisher's method with 
      dependent correction is adopted to integrate 27 scores obtained in this way, and 
      a final q-value is calibrated for prioritizing candidate genes. A series of 
      validation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of 
      this approach. We further show the effectiveness of this method in exome 
      sequencing studies of autism and epileptic encephalopathies. An online service 
      and the standalone software of pgWalk can be found at 
      http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/jianglab/pgwalk.

TI  - Germline PARP4 mutations in patients with primary thyroid and breast cancers.
PG  - 171-9
LID - 10.1530/ERC-15-0359 [doi]
AB  - Germline mutations in the PTEN gene, which cause Cowden syndrome, are known to be 
      one of the genetic factors for primary thyroid and breast cancers; however, PTEN 
      mutations are found in only a small subset of research participants with 
      non-syndrome breast and thyroid cancers. In this study, we aimed to identify 
      germline variants that may be related to genetic risk of primary thyroid and 
      breast cancers. Genomic DNAs extracted from peripheral blood of 14 PTEN WT female 
      research participants with primary thyroid and breast cancers were analyzed by 
      whole-exome sequencing. Gene-based case-control association analysis using the 
      information of 406 Europeans obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project database 
      identified 34 genes possibly associated with the phenotype with P < 1.0 × 10(-3). 
      Among them, rare variants in the PARP4 gene were detected at significant high 
      frequency (odds ratio = 5.2; P = 1.0 × 10(-5)). The variants, G496V and T1170I, 
      were found in six of the 14 study participants (43%) while their frequencies were 
      only 0.5% in controls. Functional analysis using HCC1143 cell line showed that 
      knockdown of PARP4 with siRNA significantly enhanced the cell proliferation, 
      compared with the cells transfected with siControl (P = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier 
      analysis using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), European Genome-phenome Archive 
      (EGA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets showed poor relapse-free 
      survival (P < 0.001, Hazard ratio 1.27) and overall survival (P = 0.006, Hazard 
      ratio 1.41) in a PARP4 low-expression group, suggesting that PARP4 may function 
      as a tumor suppressor. In conclusion, we identified PARP4 as a possible 
      susceptibility gene of primary thyroid and breast cancer.

TI  - The origin of snakes: revealing the ecology, behavior, and evolutionary history 
      of early snakes using genomics, phenomics, and the fossil record.
PG  - 87

AB  - BACKGROUND: The highly derived morphology and astounding diversity of snakes has 
      long inspired debate regarding the ecological and evolutionary origin of both the 
      snake total-group (Pan-Serpentes) and crown snakes (Serpentes). Although 
      speculation abounds on the ecology, behavior, and provenance of the earliest 
      snakes, a rigorous, clade-wide analysis of snake origins has yet to be attempted, 
      in part due to a dearth of adequate paleontological data on early stem snakes. 
      Here, we present the first comprehensive analytical reconstruction of the 
      ancestor of crown snakes and the ancestor of the snake total-group, as inferred 
      using multiple methods of ancestral state reconstruction. We use a combined-data 
      approach that includes new information from the fossil record on extinct crown 
      snakes, new data on the anatomy of the stem snakes Najash rionegrina, Dinilysia 
      patagonica, and Coniophis precedens, and a deeper understanding of the 
      distribution of phenotypic apomorphies among the major clades of fossil and 
      Recent snakes. Additionally, we infer time-calibrated phylogenies using both new 
      'tip-dating' and traditional node-based approaches, providing new insights on 
      temporal patterns in the early evolutionary history of snakes. RESULTS: 
      Comprehensive ancestral state reconstructions reveal that both the ancestor of 
      crown snakes and the ancestor of total-group snakes were nocturnal, widely 
      foraging, non-constricting stealth hunters. They likely consumed soft-bodied 
      vertebrate and invertebrate prey that was subequal to head size, and occupied 
      terrestrial settings in warm, well-watered, and well-vegetated environments. The 
      snake total-group - approximated by the Coniophis node - is inferred to have 
      originated on land during the middle Early Cretaceous (~128.5 Ma), with the 
      crown-group following about 20 million years later, during the Albian stage. Our 
      inferred divergence dates provide strong evidence for a major radiation of 
      henophidian snake diversity in the wake of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass 
      extinction, clarifying the pattern and timing of the extant snake radiation. 
      Although the snake crown-group most likely arose on the supercontinent of 
      Gondwana, our results suggest the possibility that the snake total-group 
      originated on Laurasia. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new insights into when, 
      where, and how snakes originated, and presents the most complete picture of the 
      early evolution of snakes to date. More broadly, we demonstrate the striking 
      influence of including fossils and phenotypic data in combined analyses aimed at 
      both phylogenetic topology inference and ancestral state reconstruction.

AB  - Disease risk and treatment response are determined, at the individual level, by a 
      complex history of genetic and environmental interactions, including those with 
      our endogenous microbiomes. Personalized health care requires a deep 
      understanding of patient biology that can now be measured using a range of 
      '-omics' technologies. Patient stratification involves the identification of 
      genetic and/or phenotypic disease subclasses that require different therapeutic 
      strategies. Stratified medicine approaches to disease diagnosis, prognosis and 
      therapeutic response monitoring herald a new dimension in patient care. Here, we 
      explore the potential value of metabolic profiling as applied to unmet clinical 
      needs in gastroenterology and hepatology. We describe potential applications in a 
      number of diseases, with emphasis on large-scale population studies as well as 
      metabolic profiling on the individual level, using spectrometric and imaging 
      technologies that will leverage the discovery of mechanistic information and 
      deliver novel health care solutions to improve clinical pathway management.

AB  - An organism's anatomy is the result of millions of years of interplay between DNA 
      sequence, developmental processes, the environment, and evolutionary forces. The 
      anatomical sciences are consequently highly integrative and interdisciplinary. 
      That said, reaching across all of the relevant disciplines can be a daunting task 
      because scientific publications are produced today at an astounding rate. This 
      manuscript brings together insights from the quantitative genetic analysis of 
      dental variation into the study of human evolutionary odontology within the 
      context of genomics, genetic modularity, and phenomics. It primarily advocates 
      the use of quantitative genetics to not only identify QTLs, but also to assess 
      the patterns of genetic covariance that underlie phenotypic covariance, thereby 
      enabling us to conceptualize phenotypic variation as a reflection of the 
      underlying genetic mechanisms. By highlighting three phenotypes of importance 
      within the study of human evolution (patterning of the dental arcade, enamel 
      thickness, and taurodontism), it is demonstrated how an integrated consideration 
      of quantitative genetics, genomic analyses, and paleontology can bring us to more 
      detailed hypotheses about the evolution of the hominid clade.

TI  - A common risk variant in CACNA1C supports a sex-dependent effect on longitudinal

      not bipolar disorder.

AB  - Sex is a powerful modulator of disease susceptibility, course and outcome. The 
      gene CACNA1C is among the best replicated vulnerability genes of bipolar disorder 
      and schizophrenia. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether sex 
      and a variant in CACNA1C (rs10774035 as a proxy for the well-acknowledged risk 
      variant rs1006737) influence psychosocial adaptation in a large German patient 
      sample with schizophrenia-spectrum (n=297) and bipolar (n=516) disorders. We 
      analyzed Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores, retrospectively collected 
      for different time points during disease course. We investigated whether CACNA1C 
      sex-dependently modulates longitudinal GAF scores and recovery from episodes of 
      psychiatric disturbance in the above mentioned disorders. Psychosocial recovery 
      was measured as difference score between the current GAF score (assessing the 
      last remission) and the worst GAF score ever during an illness episode. 
      Covariate- adjusted association analyses revealed a sex × rs10774035 genotype 
      interaction on longitudinal GAF and recovery from illness episodes only in 
      schizophrenia-spectrum but not in bipolar disorders. In schizophrenia-spectrum 
      affected males, rs10774035 minor allele (T) carriers had higher GAF scores at 
      three time points (premorbid, worst ever, current). In contrast, females carrying 
      rs10774035 minor alleles had impaired recovery from schizophrenia-spectrum 
      episodes. These results encourage further investigations of gene × sex 
      interactions and longitudinal quantitative phenotypes to unravel the rich variety 
      of behavioral consequences of genetic individuality.

TI  - Caffeine differentially alters cortical hemodynamic activity during working 
      memory: a near infrared spectroscopy study.
PG  - 520

AB  - BACKGROUND: Caffeine is a widely used stimulant with potentially beneficial 
      effects on cognition as well as vasoconstrictive properties. In functional 
      magnetic imaging research, caffeine has gained attention as a potential enhancer 
      of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response. In order to clarify 
      changes of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin (HbO and HbR) induced by caffeine during a 
      cognitive task, we investigated a working memory (WM) paradigm (visual 2-back) 
      using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). RESULTS: Behaviorally, caffeine had no 
      effect on the WM performance but influenced reaction times in the 0-back 
      condition. NIRS data demonstrate caffeine-dependent alterations of the course of 
      the hemodynamic response. The intake of 200 mg caffeine caused a significant 
      decrease of the HbO response between 20 and 40 s after the onset of a 2-back task 
      in the bilateral inferior frontal cortex (IFC). In parallel, the HbR response of 
      the left IFC was significantly increased due to caffeine intake. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      line with previous results, we did not detect an effect of caffeine on most 
      aspects of behavior. Effects of caffeine on brain vasculature were detected as 
      general reduction of HbO. Neuronal effects of caffeine are reflected in an 
      increased concentration of HbR in the left hemisphere when performing a verbal 
      memory task and suggest influences on metabolism.

TI  - Application of clinical text data for phenome-wide association studies (PheWASs).
PG  - 1981-7
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv076 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are effective for describing 
      genetic complexities of common diseases. Phenome-wide association studies 
      (PheWASs) offer an alternative and complementary approach to GWAS using data 
      embedded in the electronic health record (EHR) to define the phenome. 
      International Classification of Disease version 9 (ICD9) codes are used 
      frequently to define the phenome, but using ICD9 codes alone misses other 
      clinically relevant information from the EHR that can be used for PheWAS analyses 
      and discovery. RESULTS: As an alternative to ICD9 coding, a text-based phenome 
      was defined by 23 384 clinically relevant terms extracted from Marshfield 
      Clinic's EHR. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with known phenotypic 
      associations were genotyped in 4235 individuals and associated across the 
      text-based phenome. All five SNPs genotyped were associated with expected terms 
      (P<0.02), most at or near the top of their respective PheWAS ranking. Raw 
      association results indicate that text data performed equivalently to ICD9 coding 
      and demonstrate the utility of information beyond ICD9 coding for application in 
      PheWAS.

TI  - A multi-institution evaluation of clinical profile anonymization.
PG  - e131-7
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv154 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is an increasing desire to share de-identified 
      electronic health records (EHRs) for secondary uses, but there are concerns that 
      clinical terms can be exploited to compromise patient identities. Anonymization 
      algorithms mitigate such threats while enabling novel discoveries, but their 
      evaluation has been limited to single institutions. Here, we study how an 
      existing clinical profile anonymization fares at multiple medical centers. 
      METHODS: We apply a state-of-the-artk-anonymization algorithm, withkset to the 
      standard value 5, to the International Classification of Disease, ninth edition 
      codes for patients in a hypothyroidism association study at three medical 
      centers: Marshfield Clinic, Northwestern University, and Vanderbilt University. 
      We assess utility when anonymizing at three population levels: all patients in 1) 
      the EHR system; 2) the biorepository; and 3) a hypothyroidism study. We evaluate 
      utility using 1) changes to the number included in the dataset, 2) number of 
      codes included, and 3) regions generalization and suppression were required. 
      RESULTS: Our findings yield several notable results. First, we show that 
      anonymizing in the context of the entire EHR yields a significantly greater 
      quantity of data by reducing the amount of generalized regions from ∼15% to 
      ∼0.5%. Second, ∼70% of codes that needed generalization only generalized two or 
      three codes in the largest anonymization. CONCLUSIONS: Sharing large volumes of 
      clinical data in support of phenome-wide association studies is possible while 
      safeguarding privacy to the underlying individuals.

TI  - Dual-5α-Reductase Inhibition Promotes Hepatic Lipid Accumulation in Man.
PG  - 103-13
LID - 10.1210/jc.2015-2928 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: 5α-Reductase 1 and 2 (SRD5A1, SRD5A2) inactivate cortisol to 
      5α-dihydrocortisol in addition to their role in the generation of DHT. 
      Dutasteride (dual SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 inhibitor) and finasteride (selective SRD5A2 
      inhibitor) are commonly prescribed, but their potential metabolic effects have 
      only recently been identified. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to provide a detailed 
      assessment of the metabolic effects of SRD5A inhibition and in particular the 
      impact on hepatic lipid metabolism. DESIGN: We conducted a randomized study in 12 
      healthy male volunteers with detailed metabolic phenotyping performed before and 
      after a 3-week treatment with finasteride (5 mg od) or dutasteride (0.5 mg od). 
      Hepatic magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and two-step hyperinsulinemic 
      euglycemic clamps incorporating stable isotopes with concomitant adipose tissue 
      microdialysis were used to evaluate carbohydrate and lipid flux. Analysis of the 
      serum metabolome was performed using ultra-HPLC-mass spectrometry. SETTING: The 
      study was performed in the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Queen 
      Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: 
      Incorporation of hepatic lipid was measured with MRS. RESULTS: Dutasteride, not 
      finasteride, increased hepatic insulin resistance. Intrahepatic lipid increased 
      on MRS after dutasteride treatment and was associated with increased rates of de 
      novo lipogenesis. Adipose tissue lipid mobilization was decreased by dutasteride. 
      Analysis of the serum metabolome demonstrated that in the fasted state, 
      dutasteride had a significant effect on lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Dual-SRD5A 
      inhibition with dutasteride is associated with increased intrahepatic lipid 
      accumulation.

TI  - Yeast Phenomics: An Experimental Approach for Modeling Gene Interaction Networks 
      that Buffer Disease.
PG  - 24-45
LID - 10.3390/genes6010024 [doi]
AB  - The genome project increased appreciation of genetic complexity underlying 
      disease phenotypes: many genes contribute each phenotype and each gene 
      contributes multiple phenotypes. The aspiration of predicting common disease in 
      individuals has evolved from seeking primary loci to marginal risk assignments 
      based on many genes. Genetic interaction, defined as contributions to a phenotype 
      that are dependent upon particular digenic allele combinations, could improve 
      prediction of phenotype from complex genotype, but it is difficult to study in 
      human populations. High throughput, systematic analysis of S. cerevisiae gene 
      knockouts or knockdowns in the context of disease-relevant phenotypic 
      perturbations provides a tractable experimental approach to derive gene 
      interaction networks, in order to deduce by cross-species gene homology how 
      phenotype is buffered against disease-risk genotypes. Yeast gene interaction 
      network analysis to date has revealed biology more complex than previously 
      imagined. This has motivated the development of more powerful yeast cell array 
      phenotyping methods to globally model the role of gene interaction networks in 
      modulating phenotypes (which we call yeast phenomic analysis). The article 
      illustrates yeast phenomic technology, which is applied here to quantify gene X 
      media interaction at higher resolution and supports use of a human-like media for 
      future applications of yeast phenomics for modeling human disease.

LID - 10.1159/000439196 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The leading cause of ESRD in the U.S. is diabetic kidney disease 
      (DKD). Despite significant efforts to improve outcomes in DKD, the impact on 
      disease progression has been disappointing. This has prompted clinicians and 
      researchers to search for alternative approaches to identify persons at risk, and 
      to search for more effective therapies to halt progression of DKD. Identification 
      of novel therapies is critically dependent on a more comprehensive understanding 
      of the pathophysiology of DKD, specifically at the molecular level. A more 
      expansive and exploratory view of DKD is needed to complement more traditional 
      research approaches that have focused on single molecules. SUMMARY: In recent 
      years, sophisticated research methodologies have emerged within systems biology 
      that should allow for a more comprehensive disease definition of DKD. Systems 
      biology provides an inter-disciplinary approach to describe complex interactions 
      within biological systems including how these interactions influence systems' 
      functions and behaviors. Computational modeling of large, system-wide, 
      quantitative data sets is used to generate molecular interaction pathways, such 
      as metabolic and cell signaling networks. KEY MESSAGES: Importantly, 
      interpretation of data generated by systems biology tools requires integration 
      with enhanced clinical research data and validation using model systems. Such an 
      integrative biological approach has already generated novel insights into 
      pathways and molecules involved in DKD. In this review, we highlight recent 
      examples of how combining systems biology with traditional clinical and model 
      research efforts results in an integrative biology approach that has 
      significantly added to the understanding of the complex pathophysiology of DKD.

TI  - Phenomics of Vascular Disease: The Systematic Approach to the Combination 
      Therapy.
PG  - 433-40
AB  - Vascular diseases are usually caused by multifactorial pathogeneses involving 
      genetic and environmental factors. Our current understanding of vascular disease 
      is, however, based on the focused genotype/phenotype studies driven by the 
      "one-gene/one-phenotype" hypothesis. Drugs with "pure target" at individual 
      molecules involved in the pathophysiological pathways are the mainstream of 
      current clinical treatments and the basis of combination therapy of vascular 
      diseases. Recently, the combination of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics has 
      unraveled the etiology and pathophysiology of vascular disease in a big-data 
      fashion and also revealed unmatched relationships between the omic variability 
      and the much narrower definition of various clinical phenotypes of vascular 
      disease in individual patients. Here, we introduce the phenomics strategy that 
      will change the conventional focused phenotype/genotype/genome study to a new 
      systematic phenome/genome/proteome approach to the understanding of 
      pathophysiology and combination therapy of vascular disease. A phenome is the sum 
      total of an organism's phenotypic traits that signify the expression of genome 
      and specific environmental influence. Phenomics is the study of phenome to 
      quantitatively correlate complex traits to variability not only in genome, but 
      also in transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, interactome, and environmental 
      factors by exploring the systems biology that links the genomic and phenomic 
      spaces. The application of phenomics and the phenome-wide associated study 
      (PheWAS) will not only identify a systemically-integrated set of biomarkers for 
      diagnosis and prognosis of vascular disease but also provide novel treatment 
      targets for combination therapy and thus make a revolutionary paradigm shift in 
      the clinical treatment of these devastating diseases.

AB  - Recent studies have shown how volumetric imaging and morphometrics can add 
      significantly to our understanding of morphogenesis, the developmental basis for 
      variation, and the etiology of structural birth defects. On the other hand, the 
      complex questions and diverse imaging data in developmental biology present 
      morphometrics with more complex challenges than applications in virtually any 
      other field. Meeting these challenges is necessary in order to understand the 
      mechanistic basis for variation in complex morphologies. This chapter reviews the 
      methods and theory that enable the application of modern landmark-based 
      morphometrics to developmental biology and craniofacial development, in 
      particular. We discuss the theoretical foundations of morphometrics as applied to 
      development and review the basic approaches to the quantification of morphology. 
      Focusing on geometric morphometrics, we discuss the principal statistical methods 
      for quantifying and comparing morphological variation and covariation structure 
      within and among groups. Finally, we discuss the future directions for 
      morphometrics in developmental biology that will be required for approaches that 
      enable quantitative integration across the genotype-phenotype map.

      providing unique prospects to gain insights into the intricacies of the biology 
      of these blood flukes, their host relationships, and the diseases that they 
      cause. This article reviews some key applications of double-stranded RNA 
      interference (RNAi) in Schistosoma mansoni, appraises delivery systems for 
      transgenesis and stable gene silencing, considers ways of increasing efficiency 
      and specificity of gene silencing, and discusses the prospects of using a 
      lentivirus delivery system for future functional genomic-phenomic explorations of 
      schistosomes and other parasites. The ability to achieve effective and stable 
      gene perturbation in parasites has major biological implications and could 
      facilitate the development of new interventions.

TI  - Assessing a learning process with functional ANOVA estimators of EEG power 
      spectral densities.
PG  - 175-83
LID - 10.1007/s11571-015-9368-7 [doi]
AB  - We propose to assess the process of learning a task using electroencephalographic 
      (EEG) measurements. In particular, we quantify changes in brain activity 
      associated to the progression of the learning experience through the functional 
      analysis-of-variances (FANOVA) estimators of the EEG power spectral density 
      (PSD). Such functional estimators provide a sense of the effect of training in 
      the EEG dynamics. For that purpose, we implemented an experiment to monitor the 
      process of learning to type using the Colemak keyboard layout during a 
      twelve-lessons training. Hence, our aim is to identify statistically significant 
      changes in PSD of various EEG rhythms at different stages and difficulty levels 
      of the learning process. Those changes are taken into account only when a 
      probabilistic measure of the cognitive state ensures the high engagement of the 
      volunteer to the training. Based on this, a series of statistical tests are 
      performed in order to determine the personalized frequencies and sensors at which 
      changes in PSD occur, then the FANOVA estimates are computed and analyzed. Our 
      experimental results showed a significant decrease in the power of [Formula: see 
      text] and [Formula: see text] rhythms for ten volunteers during the learning 
      process, and such decrease happens regardless of the difficulty of the lesson. 
      These results are in agreement with previous reports of changes in PSD being 
      associated to feature binding and memory encoding.

TI  - Conservation and divergence of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase 
      A (cAMP-PKA) pathway in two plant-pathogenic fungi: Fusarium graminearum and 
      F. verticillioides.
PG  - 196-209
LID - 10.1111/mpp.12272 [doi]
AB  - The cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) pathway is a 
      central signalling cascade that transmits extracellular stimuli and governs cell 
      responses through the second messenger cAMP. The importance of cAMP signalling in 
      fungal biology has been well documented and the key conserved components, 
      adenylate cyclase (AC) and the catalytic subunit of PKA (CPKA), have been 
      functionally characterized. However, other genes involved in this signalling 
      pathway and their regulation are not well understood in filamentous fungi. Here, 
      we performed a comparative transcriptomics analysis of AC and CPKA mutants in two 
      closely related fungi: Fusarium graminearum (Fg) and F. verticillioides (Fv). 
      Combining available Fg transcriptomics and phenomics data, we reconstructed the 
      Fg cAMP signalling pathway. We developed a computational program that combines 
      sequence conservation and patterns of orthologous gene expression to facilitate 
      global transcriptomics comparisons between different organisms. We observed 
      highly correlated expression patterns for most orthologues (80%) between Fg and 
      Fv. We also identified a subset of 482 (6%) diverged orthologues, whose 
      expression under all conditions was at least 50% higher in one genome than in the 
      other. This enabled us to dissect the conserved and unique portions of the 
      cAMP-PKA pathway. Although the conserved portions controlled essential functions, 
      such as metabolism, the cell cycle, chromatin remodelling and the oxidative 
      stress response, the diverged portions had species-specific roles, such as the 
      production and detoxification of secondary metabolites unique to each species. 
      The evolution of the cAMP-PKA signalling pathway seems to have contributed 
      directly to fungal divergence and niche adaptation.

TI  - Plant phenomics and the need for physiological phenotyping across scales to 
      narrow the genotype-to-phenotype knowledge gap.
PG  - 5429-40
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erv345 [doi]
AB  - Plants are affected by complex genome×environment×management interactions which 
      determine phenotypic plasticity as a result of the variability of genetic 
      components. Whereas great advances have been made in the cost-efficient and 
      high-throughput analyses of genetic information and non-invasive phenotyping, the 
      large-scale analyses of the underlying physiological mechanisms lag behind. The 
      external phenotype is determined by the sum of the complex interactions of 
      metabolic pathways and intracellular regulatory networks that is reflected in an 
      internal, physiological, and biochemical phenotype. These various scales of 
      dynamic physiological responses need to be considered, and genotyping and 
      external phenotyping should be linked to the physiology at the cellular and 
      tissue level. A high-dimensional physiological phenotyping across scales is 
      needed that integrates the precise characterization of the internal phenotype 
      into high-throughput phenotyping of whole plants and canopies. By this means, 
      complex traits can be broken down into individual components of physiological 
      traits. Since the higher resolution of physiological phenotyping by 'wet 
      chemistry' is inherently limited in throughput, high-throughput non-invasive 
      phenotyping needs to be validated and verified across scales to be used as proxy 
      for the underlying processes. Armed with this interdisciplinary and 
      multidimensional phenomics approach, plant physiology, non-invasive phenotyping, 
      and functional genomics will complement each other, ultimately enabling the in 
      silico assessment of responses under defined environments with advanced crop 
      models. This will allow generation of robust physiological predictors also for 
      complex traits to bridge the knowledge gap between genotype and phenotype for 
      applications in breeding, precision farming, and basic research.

TI  - High-Throughput Microbore UPLC-MS Metabolic Phenotyping of Urine for Large-Scale 
      Epidemiology Studies.
PG  - 2714-21
LID - 10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b00203 [doi]
AB  - A new generation of metabolic phenotyping centers are being created to meet the 
      increasing demands of personalized healthcare, and this has resulted in a major 
      requirement for economical, high-throughput metabonomic analysis by liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Meeting these new demands represents an 
      emerging bioanalytical problem that must be solved if metabolic phenotyping is to 
      be successfully applied to large clinical and epidemiological sample sets. 
      Ultraperformance (UP)LC-MS-based metabolic phenotyping, based on 2.1 mm i.d. LC 
      columns, enables comprehensive metabolic phenotyping but, when employed for the 
      analysis of thousands of samples, results in high solvent usage. The use of 
      UPLC-MS employing 1 mm i.d. columns for metabolic phenotyping rather than the 
      conventional 2.1 mm i.d. methodology shows that the resulting optimized microbore 
      method provided equivalent or superior performance in terms of peak capacity, 
      sensitivity, and robustness. On average, we also observed, when using the 
      microbore scale separation, an increase in response of 2-3 fold over that 
      obtained with the standard 2.1 mm scale method. When applied to the analysis of 
      human urine, the 1 mm scale method showed no decline in performance over the 
      course of 1000 analyses, illustrating that microbore UPLC-MS represents a viable 
      alternative to conventional 2.1 mm i.d. formats for routine large-scale metabolic 
      profiling studies while also resulting in a 75% reduction in solvent usage. The 
      modest increase in sensitivity provided by this methodology also offers the 
      potential to either reduce sample consumption or increase the number of 
      metabolite features detected with confidence due to the increased signal-to-noise 
      ratios obtained. Implementation of this miniaturized UPLC-MS method of metabolic 
      phenotyping results in clear analytical, economic, and environmental benefits for 
      large-scale metabolic profiling studies with similar or improved analytical 
      performance compared to conventional UPLC-MS.

TI  - Massively expedited genome-wide heritability analysis (MEGHA).
PG  - 2479-84
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1415603112 [doi]
AB  - The discovery and prioritization of heritable phenotypes is a computational 
      challenge in a variety of settings, including neuroimaging genetics and analyses 
      of the vast phenotypic repositories in electronic health record systems and 
      population-based biobanks. Classical estimates of heritability require twin or 
      pedigree data, which can be costly and difficult to acquire. Genome-wide complex 
      trait analysis is an alternative tool to compute heritability estimates from 
      unrelated individuals, using genome-wide data that are increasingly ubiquitous, 
      but is computationally demanding and becomes difficult to apply in evaluating 
      very large numbers of phenotypes. Here we present a fast and accurate statistical 
      method for high-dimensional heritability analysis using genome-wide SNP data from 
      unrelated individuals, termed massively expedited genome-wide heritability 
      analysis (MEGHA) and accompanying nonparametric sampling techniques that enable 
      flexible inferences for arbitrary statistics of interest. MEGHA produces 
      estimates and significance measures of heritability with several orders of 
      magnitude less computational time than existing methods, making 
      heritability-based prioritization of millions of phenotypes based on data from 
      unrelated individuals tractable for the first time to our knowledge. As a 
      demonstration of application, we conducted heritability analyses on global and 
      local morphometric measurements derived from brain structural MRI scans, using 
      genome-wide SNP data from 1,320 unrelated young healthy adults of non-Hispanic 
      European ancestry. We also computed surface maps of heritability for cortical 
      thickness measures and empirically localized cortical regions where thickness 
      measures were significantly heritable. Our analyses demonstrate the unique 
      capability of MEGHA for large-scale heritability-based screening and 
      high-dimensional heritability profile construction.

      clustering and its application to photosynthesis.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Phenomics is the study of the properties and behaviors of organisms 
      (i.e. their phenotypes) on a high-throughput scale. New computational tools are 
      needed to analyze complex phenomics data, which consists of multiple 
      traits/behaviors that interact with each other and are dependent on external 
      factors, such as genotype and environmental conditions, in a way that has not 
      been well studied. RESULTS: We deployed an efficient framework for partitioning 
      complex and high dimensional phenotype data into distinct functional groups. To 
      achieve this, we represented measured phenotype data from each genotype as a 
      cloud-of-points, and developed a novel non-parametric clustering algorithm to 
      cluster all the genotypes. When compared with conventional clustering approaches, 
      the new method is advantageous in that it makes no assumption about the 
      parametric form of the underlying data distribution and is thus particularly 
      suitable for phenotype data analysis. We demonstrated the utility of the new 
      clustering technique by distinguishing novel phenotypic patterns in both 
      synthetic data and a high-throughput plant photosynthetic phenotype dataset. We 
      biologically verified the clustering results using four Arabidopsis chloroplast 
      mutant lines. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Software is available at 
      www.msu.edu/~jinchen/NPM. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are 
      available at Bioinformatics online. CONTACT: jinchen@msu.edu,

AB  - The ability to relate genomic differences in bacterial species to their 
      variability in expressed phenotypes is one of the most challenging tasks in 
      today's biology. Such task is of paramount importance towards the understanding 
      of biotechnologically relevant pathways and possibly for their manipulation. 
      Fundamental prerequisites are the genome-wide reconstruction of metabolic 
      pathways and a comprehensive measurement of cellular phenotypes. Cellular 
      pathways can be reliably reconstructed using the KEGG database, while the 
      OmniLog™ Phenotype Microarray (PM) technology may be used to measure nearly 2,000 
      growth conditions over time. However, few computational tools that can directly 
      link PM data with the gene(s) of interest followed by the extraction of 
      information on gene-phenotype correlation are available. In this chapter the use 
      of the DuctApe software suite is presented, which allows the joint analysis of 
      bacterial genomic and phenomic data, highlighting those pathways and reactions 
      most probably associated with phenotypic variability. A case study on four 
      Sinorhizobium meliloti strains is presented; more example datasets are available 
      online.

AB  - In an era of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics a large number of mutants are 
      available. The discovery of their phenotypes is fast becoming the bottleneck of 
      molecular plant physiology. This crisis can be overcome by imaging-based 
      phenotyping, an emerging, rapidly developing and innovative approach integrating 
      plant and computer science. A tremendous amount of digital image data are 
      automatically analysed using techniques of 'machine vision'. This minireview will 
      shed light on the available imaging strategies and discuss standard methods for 
      the automated analysis of images to give the non-bioinformatic reader an idea how 
      the new technology works. A number of successful platforms will be described and 
      the prospects that image-based phenomics may offer for elucidating hormonal 
      cross-talk and molecular growth physiology will be discussed.

AB  - We present and explore a kinetic model of ion transport across and between the 
      membranes of an isolated plant cell with an emphasis on the cell's response to 
      salt (Na(+)) stress. The vacuole, cytoplasm and apoplast are treated as 
      concentric regions separated by tonoplast and plasma membranes. The model 
      includes the transport of Na(+), K(+), Cl(-) and H(+) across both membranes via 
      primary active proton pumps, secondary active antiporters and symporters, as well 
      as passive ion channels. In addition, water transport is included, allowing us to 
      investigate both the osmotic and ionic components of salt stress. The model's 
      predictions of steady state and transient cytosolic pH and Na(+) concentrations 
      were found to be quantitatively comparable to measured experimental values. 
      Through an extensive simulation study we have identified and characterized 
      scenarios in which individual transport processes (H(+) pumps, Na(+)/H(+) 
      antiporters and channels involved in the transport of Na(+)) and their 
      combinations have major effects on the level of Na(+) in each of the cell 
      compartments. This systematic study emulates the effects of overexpressing and 
      inhibiting transporter genes by genetic modification and hence we have compared 
      our simulations with observations from experiments conducted on transgenic 
      plants. The simulations suggest that overexpressing tonoplast Na(+)/H(+) 
      antiporter genes and tonoplast H(+) pump genes lead to an increase in the storage 
      of Na(+) in the vacuole (helping the cell to maintain water uptake under salt 
      stress), with only a transient influence on the cytoplasmic Na(+) concentration. 
      The model predicts effects of varying the expression of transporter genes 
      (individually or in combination) which have yet to be investigated in 
      experiments. For example, our findings indicate that simultaneously 
      overexpressing plasma membrane and tonoplast Na(+)/H(+) antiporter genes would 
      lead to improvements in both ionic and osmotic stress tolerance. The results 
      demonstrate the importance of simultaneously modelling the transport of Na(+) 
      across both the tonoplast and plasma membrane, a task not undertaken previously.

TI  - Genome-wide analysis implicates microRNAs and their target genes in the 
      development of bipolar disorder.
PG  - e678
LID - 10.1038/tp.2015.159 [doi]
AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe and highly heritable neuropsychiatric disorder 
      with a lifetime prevalence of 1%. Molecular genetic studies have identified the 
      first BD susceptibility genes. However, the disease pathways remain largely 
      unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs, a class of small 
      noncoding RNAs, contribute to basic mechanisms underlying brain development and 
      plasticity, suggesting their possible involvement in the pathogenesis of several 
      psychiatric disorders, including BD. In the present study, gene-based analyses 
      were performed for all known autosomal microRNAs using the largest genome-wide 
      association data set of BD to date (9747 patients and 14 278 controls). 
      Associated and brain-expressed microRNAs were then investigated in target gene 
      and pathway analyses. Functional analyses of miR-499 and miR-708 were performed 
      in rat hippocampal neurons. Ninety-eight of the six hundred nine investigated 
      microRNAs showed nominally significant P-values, suggesting that BD-associated 
      microRNAs might be enriched within known microRNA loci. After correction for 
      multiple testing, nine microRNAs showed a significant association with BD. The 
      most promising were miR-499, miR-708 and miR-1908. Target gene and pathway 
      analyses revealed 18 significant canonical pathways, including brain development 
      and neuron projection. For miR-499, four Bonferroni-corrected significant target 
      genes were identified, including the genome-wide risk gene for psychiatric 
      disorder CACNB2. First results of functional analyses in rat hippocampal neurons 
      neither revealed nor excluded a major contribution of miR-499 or miR-708 to 
      dendritic spine morphogenesis. The present results suggest that research is 
      warranted to elucidate the precise involvement of microRNAs and their downstream 
      pathways in BD.

AB  - The Antarctic strain Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 is one of the model 
      organisms of cold-adapted bacteria and is currently exploited as a new 
      alternative expression host for numerous biotechnological applications. Here, we 
      investigated several metabolic features of this strain through in silico 
      modelling and functional integration of -omics data. A genome-scale metabolic 
      model of P. haloplanktis TAC125 was reconstructed, encompassing information on 
      721 genes, 1133 metabolites and 1322 reactions. The predictive potential of this 
      model was validated against a set of experimentally determined growth rates and a 
      large dataset of growth phenotypic data. Furthermore, evidence synthesis from 
      proteomics, phenomics, physiology and metabolic modelling data revealed possible 
      drawbacks of cold-dependent changes in gene expression on the overall metabolic 
      network of P. haloplanktis TAC125. These included, for example, variations in its 
      central metabolism, amino acid degradation and fatty acid biosynthesis. The 
      genome-scale metabolic model described here is the first one reconstructed so far 
      for an Antarctic microbial strain. It allowed a system-level investigation of 
      variations in cellular metabolic fluxes following a temperature downshift. It 
      represents a valuable platform for further investigations on 
      P. haloplanktis TAC125 cellular functional states and for the design of more 
      focused strategies for its possible biotechnological exploitation.

      from a single tool alone. The quality of the output variant calls is highly 
      variable however, depending on factors such as sequence library quality as well 
      as the choice of short-read aligner, variant caller, and variant caller filtering 
      strategy. Here we present a two-part study first using the high quality 'genome 
      in a bottle' reference set to demonstrate the significant impact the choice of 
      aligner, variant caller, and variant caller filtering strategy has on overall 
      variant call quality and further how certain variant callers outperform others 
      with increased sample contamination, an important consideration when analyzing 
      sequenced cancer samples. This analysis confirms previous work showing that 
      combining variant calls of multiple tools results in the best quality resultant 
      variant set, for either specificity or sensitivity, depending on whether the 
      intersection or union, of all variant calls is used respectively. Second, we 
      analyze a melanoma cell line derived from a control lymphocyte sample to 
      determine whether software choices affect the detection of clinically important 
      melanoma risk-factor variants finding that only one of the three such variants is 
      unanimously detected under all conditions. Finally, we describe a cogent strategy 
      for implementing a clinical variant detection pipeline; a strategy that requires 
      careful software selection, variant caller filtering optimizing, and combined 
      variant calls in order to effectively minimize false negative variants. While 
      implementing such features represents an increase in complexity and computation 
      the results offer indisputable improvements in data quality.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Increasingly, cost-effective high-throughput DNA sequencing 
      technologies are being utilized to sequence human pedigrees to elucidate the 
      genetic cause of a wide variety of human diseases. While numerous tools exist for 
      variant prioritization within a single genome, the ability to concurrently 
      analyze variants within pedigrees remains a challenge, especially should there be 
      no prior indication of the underlying genetic cause of the disease. Here, we 
      present a tool, variant analysis of sequenced pedigrees (VASP), a flexible data 
      integration environment capable of producing a summary of pedigree variation, 
      providing relevant information such as compound heterozygosity, genome phasing 
      and disease inheritance patterns. Designed to aggregate data across a sequenced 
      pedigree, VASP allows both powerful filtering and custom prioritization of both 
      single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small indels. Hence, clinical and research 
      users with prior knowledge of a disease are able to dramatically reduce the 
      variant search space based on a wide variety of custom prioritization criteria.

AB  - PURPOSE: Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) is a malformation of cortical 
      development due to impaired neuronal migration resulting in the formation of 
      nodular masses of neurons and glial cells in close proximity to the ventricular 
      walls. We report the clinical characteristics of the largest case series of 
      FLNA-negative patients with seizures and bilateral periventricular heterotopia. 
      METHODS: Participants were recruited through the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project 
      (EPGP), a multicenter collaborative effort to collect detailed phenotypic data 
      and DNA on a large number of individuals with epilepsy, including a cohort with 
      symptomatic epilepsy related to PVNH. Included subjects had epilepsy, and MRI 
      confirmed bilateral PVNH. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were visually and 
      quantitatively reviewed to investigate the topographic extent of PVNH, symmetry, 
      and laterality. KEY FINDINGS: We analyzed data on 71 patients with bilateral 
      PVNH. The incidence of febrile seizures was 16.6%. There was at least one other 
      family member with epilepsy in 36.9% of this population. Developmental delay was 
      present in 21.8%. Focal onset seizures were the most common type of seizure 
      presentation (79.3%). High heterotopia burden was strongly associated with female 
      gender and trigonal nodular localization. There was no evidence for differences 
      in brain volume between PVNH subjects and controls. No relationship was observed 
      between heterotopic volume and gender, developmental delay, location of PVNH, 
      ventricular or cerebellar abnormalities, laterality of seizure onset, age at 
      seizure onset, and duration of epilepsy. SIGNIFICANCE: A direct correlation was 
      observed between high heterotopia burden, female gender, and trigonal location in 
      this large cohort of FLNA-negative bilateral PVNH patients with epilepsy. 
      Quantitative MRI measurements indicated that this correlation is based on the 
      diffuse nature of the heterotopic nodules rather than on the total volume of 
      abnormal heterotopic tissue.

TI  - Kraepelin revisited: schizophrenia from degeneration to failed regeneration.
PG  - 671-6
LID - 10.1038/mp.2015.35 [doi]
AB  - One hundred years after its conceptual definition as 'Dementia Praecox' by Emil 
      Kraepelin, schizophrenia is still a serious psychiatric illness that affects 
      young adults and leads to disability in at least half of patients. The key 
      treatment issue is partial or non-response, especially of negative symptoms. The 
      illness is also associated with different degrees of cognitive dysfunction, 
      particularly in verbal and working memory; the resulting functional impairment 
      may lead to unemployment and an inability to maintain stable relationships. 
      Patients' cognitive dysfunction led Kraepelin to the assumption that 
      schizophrenia is a form of juvenile dementia caused by a degenerative process of 
      the human brain. Postmortem studies and a plethora of imaging studies do not 
      support the notion of a degenerative process, but such a process is supported by 
      the recently published, largest genome-wide association study on schizophrenia. 
      More than a 100 hits were described, converging on pathways that have a 
      significant role in dopamine metabolism in immune modulation, calcium signalling 
      and synaptic plasticity. This review suggests that research should focus on 
      animal models based on risk genes like transcription factor 4 and study the 
      effects of exposure to environmental stressors relevant for schizophrenia. The 
      use of relevant end points like pre-pulse inhibition or cognitive dysfunction 
      will allow us to gain an understanding of the molecular pathways in schizophrenia 
      and consequently result in improved treatment options, especially for the 
      disabling aspects of this illness.

AB  - Mendelian randomization (MR) is an approach that uses genetic variants associated 
      with a modifiable exposure or biological intermediate to estimate the causal 
      relationship between these variables and a medically relevant outcome. Although 
      it was initially developed to examine the relationship between modifiable 
      exposures/biomarkers and disease, its use has expanded to encompass applications 
      in molecular epidemiology, systems biology, pharmacogenomics, and many other 
      areas. The purpose of this review is to introduce MR, the principles behind the 
      approach, and its limitations. We consider some of the new applications of the 
      methodology, including informing drug development, and comment on some promising 
      extensions, including two-step, two-sample, and bidirectional MR. We show how 
      these new methods can be combined to efficiently examine causality in complex 
      biological networks and provide a new framework to data mine high-dimensional 
      studies as we transition into the age of hypothesis-free causality.

AB  - Obesity is a major public health problem worldwide. We used 24-hour urinary 
      metabolic profiling by proton ((1)H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
      spectroscopy and ion exchange chromatography to characterize the metabolic 
      signatures of adiposity in the U.S. (n = 1880) and UK (n = 444) cohorts of the 
      INTERMAP (International Study of Macro- and Micronutrients and Blood Pressure) 
      epidemiologic study. Metabolic profiling of urine samples collected over two 
      24-hour time periods 3 weeks apart showed reproducible patterns of metabolite 
      excretion associated with adiposity. Exploratory analysis of the urinary 
      metabolome using (1)H NMR spectroscopy of the U.S. samples identified 29 
      molecular species, clustered in interconnecting metabolic pathways, that were 
      significantly associated (P = 1.5 × 10(-5) to 2.0 × 10(-36)) with body mass index 
      (BMI); 25 of these species were also found in the UK validation cohort. We found 
      multiple associations between urinary metabolites and BMI including urinary 
      glycoproteins and N-acetyl neuraminate (related to renal function), 
      trimethylamine, dimethylamine, 4-cresyl sulfate, phenylacetylglutamine and 
      2-hydroxyisobutyrate (gut microbial co-metabolites), succinate and citrate 
      (tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates), ketoleucine and the ketoleucine/leucine 
      ratio (linked to skeletal muscle mitochondria and branched-chain amino acid 
      metabolism), ethanolamine (skeletal muscle turnover), and 3-methylhistidine 
      (skeletal muscle turnover and meat intake). We mapped the multiple BMI-metabolite 
      relationships as part of an integrated systems network that describes the 
      connectivities between the complex pathway and compartmental signatures of human 
      adiposity.

AB  - In the shared pursuit of elucidating detailed mechanisms of cell function, 
      systems biology presents a natural complement to ongoing efforts in cell biology. 
      Systems biology aims to characterize biological systems through integrated and 
      quantitative modeling of cellular information. The process of model building and 
      analysis provides value through synthesizing and cataloging information about 
      cells and molecules, predicting mechanisms and identifying generalizable themes, 
      generating hypotheses and guiding experimental design, and highlighting knowledge 
      gaps and refining understanding. In turn, incorporating domain expertise and 
      experimental data is crucial for building towards whole cell models. An iterative 
      cycle of interaction between cell and systems biologists advances the goals of 
      both fields and establishes a framework for mechanistic understanding of the 
      genome-to-phenome relationship.

TI  - Non-invasive, whole-plant imaging of chloroplast movement and chlorophyll 
      fluorescence reveals photosynthetic phenotypes independent of chloroplast 
      photorelocation defects in chloroplast division mutants.
PG  - 428-42
LID - 10.1111/tpj.13009 [doi]
AB  - Leaf chloroplast movement is thought to optimize light capture and to minimize 
      photodamage. To better understand the impact of chloroplast movement on 
      photosynthesis, we developed a technique based on the imaging of reflectance from 
      leaf surfaces that enables continuous, high-sensitivity, non-invasive 
      measurements of chloroplast movement in multiple intact plants under white 
      actinic light. We validated the method by measuring photorelocation responses in 
      Arabidopsis chloroplast division mutants with drastically enlarged chloroplasts, 
      and in phototropin mutants with impaired photorelocation but normal chloroplast 
      morphology, under different light regimes. Additionally, we expanded our platform 
      to permit simultaneous image-based measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and 
      chloroplast movement. We show that chloroplast division mutants with enlarged, 
      less-mobile chloroplasts exhibit greater photosystem II photodamage than is 
      observed in the wild type, particularly under fluctuating high levels of light. 
      Comparison between division mutants and the severe photorelocation mutant phot1-5 
      phot2-1 showed that these effects are not entirely attributable to diminished 
      photorelocation responses, as previously hypothesized, implying that altered 
      chloroplast morphology affects other photosynthetic processes. Our dual-imaging 
      platform also allowed us to develop a straightforward approach to correct 
      non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) calculations for interference from chloroplast 
      movement. This correction method should be generally useful when fluorescence and 
      reflectance are measured in the same experiments. The corrected data indicate 
      that the energy-dependent (qE) and photoinhibitory (qI) components of NPQ 
      contribute differentially to the NPQ phenotypes of the chloroplast division and 
      photorelocation mutants. This imaging technology thus provides a platform for 
      analyzing the contributions of chloroplast movement, chloroplast morphology and 
      other phenotypic attributes to the overall photosynthetic performance of higher 
      plants.

PG  - 2182-7
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.37130 [doi]
AB  - Growth deficiency, psychomotor delay, and facial dysmorphism was originally 
      described in a male patient in 1989 by Wiedemann et al. and later in 2000 by 
      Steiner et al. Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) has since been described only a 
      few times in the literature, with the phenotypic spectrum both expanding and 
      becoming more delineated with each patient reported. We report on the clinical 
      and molecular features of monozygotic twins with a de novo mutation in KMT2A. 
      Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray was done on both twins and 
      whole-exome sequencing was done using both parents and one of the affected twins. 
      SNP microarray confirmed that they were monozygotic twins. A de novo heterozygous 
      variant (p. Arg1083*) in the KMT2A gene was identified through whole-exome 
      sequencing, confirming the diagnosis of WSS. In this study, we have identified a 
      de novo mutation in KMT2A associated with psychomotor developmental delay, facial 
      dysmorphism, short stature, hypertrichosis cubiti, and small kidneys. This 
      finding in monozygotic twins gives specificity to the WSS. The description of 
      more cases of WSS is needed for further delineation of this condition. Small 
      kidneys with normal function have not been described in this condition in the 
      medical literature before.

      as African Americans, provides a unique opportunity to identify genomic regions 
      and variants associated with the clinical variability observed for diseases and 
      traits across populations. METHOD: To begin a systematic search for these 
      population-specific genomic regions at the phenome-wide scale, we determined the 
      relationship between global genetic ancestry, specifically European and African 
      ancestry, and clinical variables measured in a population of African Americans 
      from BioVU, Vanderbilt University's biorepository linked to de-identified 
      electronic medical records (EMRs) as part of the Epidemiologic Architecture using 
      Genomics and Epidemiology (EAGLE) study. Through billing (ICD-9) codes, procedure 
      codes, labs, and clinical notes, 36 common clinical and laboratory variables were 
      mined from the EMR, including body mass index (BMI), kidney traits, lipid levels, 
      blood pressure, and electrocardiographic measurements. A total of 15,863 DNA 
      samples from non-European Americans were genotyped on the Illumina Metabochip 
      containing ~200,000 variants, of which 11,166 were from African Americans. Tests 
      of association were performed to examine associations between global ancestry and 
      the phenotype of interest. RESULTS: Increased European ancestry, and conversely 
      decreased African ancestry, was most strongly correlated with an increase in QRS 
      duration, consistent with previous observations that African Americans tend to 
      have shorter a QRS duration compared with European Americans. Despite known 
      racial/ethnic disparities in blood pressure, European and African ancestry was 
      neither associated with diastolic nor systolic blood pressure measurements. 
      CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results suggest that this clinical population can 
      be used to identify traits in which population differences may be due, in part, 
      to population-specific genetics.

AB  - Advances in molecular profiling and sensor technologies are expanding the scope 
      of personalized medicine beyond genotypes, providing new opportunities for 
      developing richer and more dynamic multi-scale models of individual health. 
      Recent studies demonstrate the value of scoring high-dimensional microbiome, 
      immune, and metabolic traits from individuals to inform personalized medicine. 
      Efforts to integrate multiple dimensions of clinical and molecular data towards 
      predictive multi-scale models of individual health and wellness are already 
      underway. Improved methods for mining and discovery of clinical phenotypes from 
      electronic medical records and technological developments in wearable sensor 
      technologies present new opportunities for mapping and exploring the critical yet 
      poorly characterized "phenome" and "envirome" dimensions of personalized 
      medicine. There are ambitious new projects underway to collect multi-scale 
      molecular, sensor, clinical, behavioral, and environmental data streams from 
      large population cohorts longitudinally to enable more comprehensive and dynamic 
      models of individual biology and personalized health. Personalized medicine 
      stands to benefit from inclusion of rich new sources and dimensions of data. 
      However, realizing these improvements in care relies upon novel informatics 
      methodologies, tools, and systems to make full use of these data to advance both 
      the science and translational applications of personalized medicine.

TI  - Calm down when the heart is stressed: Inhibiting calmodulin-dependent protein

AB  - Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a pivotal role in 
      many regulatory processes of cellular functions ranging from membrane potentials 
      and electric-contraction (E-C) coupling to mitochondrial integrity and survival 
      of cardiomyocytes. The review article by Hund and Mohler in this issue of Trends 
      in Cardiovascular Medicine highlights the importance of the elevated CaMKII 
      signaling pathways under stressed conditions such as myocardial hypertrophy and 
      ischemia in the detrimental remodeling of ion channels and in the genesis of 
      cardiac arrhythmias. Down-regulation of the elevated CaMKII is now emerging as a 
      powerful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and other 
      forms of heart disease such as hypertrophic and ischemic heart failure. The 
      development of new specific and effective CaMKII inhibitors as therapeutic agents 
      for cardiac arrhythmias is challenged by the tremendous complexity of CaMKII 
      expression and distribution of multi isoforms, as well as the multitude of 
      downstream targets in the CaMKII signaling pathways and regulatory processes. A 
      systematic understanding of the structure and regulation of the CaMKII signaling 
      and functional network under the scope of genome and phenome may improve and 
      extend our knowledge about the role of CaMKII in cardiac health and disease and 
      accelerate the discovery of new CaMKII inhibitors that target not only the 
      ATP-binding site but also the regulation sites in the CaMKII signaling and 
      functional network.

TI  - TYK2 protein-coding variants protect against rheumatoid arthritis and 
      autoimmunity, with no evidence of major pleiotropic effects on non-autoimmune 
      complex traits.
PG  - e0122271

AB  - Despite the success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in detecting a 
      large number of loci for complex phenotypes such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
      susceptibility, the lack of information on the causal genes leaves important 
      challenges to interpret GWAS results in the context of the disease biology. Here, 
      we genetically fine-map the RA risk locus at 19p13 to define causal variants, and 
      explore the pleiotropic effects of these same variants in other complex traits. 
      First, we combined Immunochip dense genotyping (n = 23,092 case/control samples), 
      Exomechip genotyping (n = 18,409 case/control samples) and targeted 
      exon-sequencing (n = 2,236 case/controls samples) to demonstrate that three 
      protein-coding variants in TYK2 (tyrosine kinase 2) independently protect against 
      RA: P1104A (rs34536443, OR = 0.66, P = 2.3 x 10(-21)), A928V (rs35018800, OR = 
      0.53, P = 1.2 x 10(-9)), and I684S (rs12720356, OR = 0.86, P = 4.6 x 10(-7)). 
      Second, we show that the same three TYK2 variants protect against systemic lupus 
      erythematosus (SLE, Pomnibus = 6 x 10(-18)), and provide suggestive evidence that 
      two of the TYK2 variants (P1104A and A928V) may also protect against inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD; P(omnibus) = 0.005). Finally, in a phenome-wide association 
      study (PheWAS) assessing >500 phenotypes using electronic medical records (EMR) 
      in >29,000 subjects, we found no convincing evidence for association of P1104A 
      and A928V with complex phenotypes other than autoimmune diseases such as RA, SLE 
      and IBD. Together, our results demonstrate the role of TYK2 in the pathogenesis 
      of RA, SLE and IBD, and provide supporting evidence for TYK2 as a promising drug 
      target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

AB  - Plants are constantly exposed to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses that 
      reduce their fitness and performance. At the molecular level, the perception of 
      extracellular stimuli and the subsequent activation of defense responses require 
      a complex interplay of signaling cascades, in which protein phosphorylation plays 
      a central role. Several studies have shown that some members of the Leucine-Rich 
      Repeat Receptor-Like Kinase (LRR-RLK) family are involved in stress and 
      developmental pathways. We report here a systematic analysis of the role of the 
      members of this gene family by mutant phenotyping in the monocotyledon model 
      plant rice, Oryza sativa. We have then targeted 176 of the ∼320 LRR-RLK genes 
      (55.7%) and genotyped 288 mutant lines. Position of the insertion was confirmed 
      in 128 lines corresponding to 100 LRR-RLK genes (31.6% of the entire family). All 
      mutant lines harboring homozygous insertions have been screened for phenotypes 
      under normal conditions and under various abiotic stresses. Mutant plants have 
      been observed at several stages of growth, from seedlings in Petri dishes to 
      flowering and grain filling under greenhouse conditions. Our results show that 37 
      of the LRR-RLK rice genes are potential targets for improvement especially in the 
      generation of abiotic stress tolerant cereals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate detection of somatic single nucleotide variants and small 
      insertions and deletions from DNA sequencing experiments of tumour-normal pairs 
      is a challenging task. Tumour samples are often contaminated with normal cells 
      confounding the available evidence for the somatic variants. Furthermore, tumours 
      are heterogeneous so sub-clonal variants are observed at reduced allele 
      frequencies. We present here a cell-line titration series dataset that can be 
      used to evaluate somatic variant calling pipelines with the goal of reliably 
      calling true somatic mutations at low allele frequencies. RESULTS: Cell-line DNA 
      was mixed with matched normal DNA at 8 different ratios to generate samples with 
      known tumour cellularities, and exome sequenced on Illumina HiSeq to depths of 
      >300×. The data was processed with several different variant calling pipelines 
      and verification experiments were performed to assay >1500 somatic variant 
      candidates using Ion Torrent PGM as an orthogonal technology. By examining the 
      variants called at varying cellularities and depths of coverage, we show that the 
      best performing pipelines are able to maintain a high level of precision at any 
      cellularity. In addition, we estimate the number of true somatic variants 
      undetected as cellularity and coverage decrease. CONCLUSIONS: Our cell-line 
      titration series dataset, along with the associated verification results, was 
      effective for this evaluation and will serve as a valuable dataset for future 
      somatic calling algorithm development. The data is available for further analysis 
      at the European Genome-phenome Archive under accession number EGAS00001001016.

      Consortium's Data Access Compliance Office (ICGC DACO).

AB  - Despite a large and multifaceted effort to understand the vast landscape of 
      phenotypic data, their current form inhibits productive data analysis. The lack 
      of a community-wide, consensus-based, human- and machine-interpretable language 
      for describing phenotypes and their genomic and environmental contexts is perhaps 
      the most pressing scientific bottleneck to integration across many key fields in 
      biology, including genomics, systems biology, development, medicine, evolution, 
      ecology, and systematics. Here we survey the current phenomics landscape, 
      including data resources and handling, and the progress that has been made to 
      accurately capture relevant data descriptions for phenotypes. We present an 
      example of the kind of integration across domains that computable phenotypes 
      would enable, and we call upon the broader biology community, publishers, and 
      relevant funding agencies to support efforts to surmount today's data barriers 
      and facilitate analytical reproducibility.

      mineralization disorders.
PG  - 556-74
LID - 10.12998/wjcc.v3.i7.556 [doi]
AB  - Ectopic mineralization - inappropriate biomineralization in soft tissues - is a 
      frequent finding in physiological aging processes and several common disorders, 
      which can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Further, 
      pathologic mineralization is seen in several rare genetic disorders, which often 
      present life-threatening phenotypes. These disorders are classified based on the 
      mechanisms through which the mineralization occurs: metastatic or dystrophic 
      calcification or ectopic ossification. Underlying mechanisms have been 
      extensively studied, which resulted in several hypotheses regarding the etiology 
      of mineralization in the extracellular matrix of soft tissue. These hypotheses 
      include intracellular and extracellular mechanisms, such as the formation of 
      matrix vesicles, aberrant osteogenic and chondrogenic signaling, apoptosis and 
      oxidative stress. Though coherence between the different findings is not always 
      clear, current insights have led to improvement of the diagnosis and management 
      of ectopic mineralization patients, thus translating pathogenetic knowledge 
      (variome) to the phenotype (phenome). In this review, we will focus on the 
      clinical presentation, pathogenesis and management of primary genetic soft tissue 
      mineralization disorders. As examples of dystrophic calcification disorders 
      Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, Generalized arterial calcification of infancy, Keutel 
      syndrome, Idiopathic basal ganglia calcification and Arterial calcification due 
      to CD73 (NT5E) deficiency will be discussed. Hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral 
      calcinosis will be reviewed as an example of mineralization disorders caused by 
      metastatic calcification.

TI  - Understanding salinity responses and adopting 'omics-based' approaches to 
      generate salinity tolerant cultivars of rice.
PG  - 712
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2015.00712 [doi]
LID - 712
AB  - Soil salinity is one of the main constraints affecting production of rice 
      worldwide, by reducing growth, pollen viability as well as yield of the plant. 
      Therefore, detailed understanding of the response of rice towards soil salinity 
      at the physiological and molecular level is a prerequisite for its effective 
      management. Various approaches have been adopted by molecular biologists or 
      breeders to understand the mechanism for salinity tolerance in plants and to 
      develop salt tolerant rice cultivars. Genome wide analysis using 'omics-based' 
      tools followed by identification and functional validation of individual genes is 
      becoming one of the popular approaches to tackle this task. On the other hand, 
      mutation breeding and insertional mutagenesis has also been exploited to obtain 
      salinity tolerant crop plants. This review looks into various responses at 
      cellular and whole plant level generated in rice plants toward salinity stress 
      thus, evaluating the suitability of intervention of functional genomics to raise 
      stress tolerant plants. We have tried to highlight the usefulness of the 
      contemporary 'omics-based' approaches such as genomics, proteomics, 
      transcriptomics and phenomics towards dissecting out the salinity tolerance trait 
      in rice. In addition, we have highlighted the importance of integration of 
      various 'omics' approaches to develop an understanding of the machinery involved 
      in salinity response in rice and to move forward to develop salt tolerant 
      cultivars of rice.

TI  - Digital imaging of root traits (DIRT): a high-throughput computing and 
      collaboration platform for field-based root phenomics.
PG  - 51
LID - 10.1186/s13007-015-0093-3 [doi]
LID - 51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant root systems are key drivers of plant function and yield. They 
      are also under-explored targets to meet global food and energy demands. Many new 
      technologies have been developed to characterize crop root system architecture 
      (CRSA). These technologies have the potential to accelerate the progress in 
      understanding the genetic control and environmental response of CRSA. Putting 
      this potential into practice requires new methods and algorithms to analyze CRSA 
      in digital images. Most prior approaches have solely focused on the estimation of 
      root traits from images, yet no integrated platform exists that allows easy and 
      intuitive access to trait extraction and analysis methods from images combined 
      with storage solutions linked to metadata. Automated high-throughput phenotyping 
      methods are increasingly used in laboratory-based efforts to link plant genotype 
      with phenotype, whereas similar field-based studies remain predominantly manual 
      low-throughput. DESCRIPTION: Here, we present an open-source phenomics platform 
      "DIRT", as a means to integrate scalable supercomputing architectures into field 
      experiments and analysis pipelines. DIRT is an online platform that enables 
      researchers to store images of plant roots, measure dicot and monocot root traits 
      under field conditions, and share data and results within collaborative teams and 
      the broader community. The DIRT platform seamlessly connects end-users with 
      large-scale compute "commons" enabling the estimation and analysis of root 
      phenotypes from field experiments of unprecedented size. CONCLUSION: DIRT is an 
      automated high-throughput computing and collaboration platform for field based 
      crop root phenomics. The platform is accessible at 
      http://www.dirt.iplantcollaborative.org/ and hosted on the iPlant 
      cyber-infrastructure using high-throughput grid computing resources of the Texas 
      Advanced Computing Center (TACC). DIRT is a high volume central depository and 
      high-throughput RSA trait computation platform for plant scientists working on 
      crop roots. It enables scientists to store, manage and share crop root images 
      with metadata and compute RSA traits from thousands of images in parallel. It 
      makes high-throughput RSA trait computation available to the community with just 
      a few button clicks. As such it enables plant scientists to spend more time on 
      science rather than on technology. All stored and computed data is easily 
      accessible to the public and broader scientific community. We hope that easy data 
      accessibility will attract new tool developers and spur creative data usage that 
      may even be applied to other fields of science.

TI  - Comparative phenomics and targeted use of genomics reveals variation in carbon 
      and nitrogen assimilation among different Brettanomyces bruxellensis strains.
PG  - 9123-34
LID - 10.1007/s00253-015-6769-9 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have suggested a correlation between genotype groups of 
      Brettanomyces bruxellensis and their source of isolation. To further explore this 
      relationship, the objective of this study was to assess metabolic differences in 
      carbon and nitrogen assimilation between different B. bruxellensis strains from 
      three beverages, including beer, wine, and soft drink, using Biolog Phenotype 
      Microarrays. While some similarities of physiology were noted, many traits were 
      variable among strains. Interestingly, some phenotypes were found that could be 
      linked to strain origin, especially for the assimilation of particular α- and 
      β-glycosides as well as α- and β-substituted monosaccharides. Based upon gene 
      presence or absence, an α-glucosidase and β-glucosidase were found explaining the 
      observed phenotypes. Further, using a PCR screen on a large number of isolates, 
      we have been able to specifically link a genomic deletion to the beer strains, 
      suggesting that this region may have a fitness cost for B. bruxellensis in 
      certain fermentation systems such as brewing. More specifically, none of the beer 
      strains were found to contain a β-glucosidase, which may have direct impacts on 
      the ability for these strains to compete with other microbes or on flavor 
      production.

AB  - Mouse models play a key role in the understanding gene function, human 
      development and disease. In 2007, the Australian Government provided funding to 
      establish the Monash University embryonic stem cell-to-mouse (ES2M) facility. 
      This was part of the broader Australian Phenomics Network, a national 
      infrastructure initiative aimed at maximising access to global resources for 
      understanding gene function in the mouse. The remit of the ES2M facility is to 
      provide subsidised access for Australian biomedical researchers to the ES cell 
      resources available from the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC). The 
      stated aim of the IKMC is to generate a genetically modified mouse ES cell line 
      for all of the ~23,000 genes in the mouse genome. The principal function of the 
      Monash University ES2M service is to import genetically modified ES cells into 
      Australia and to convert them into live mice with the potential to study human 
      disease. Through advantages of economy of scale and established relationships 
      with ES cell repositories worldwide, we have created over 110 germline mouse 
      strains sourced from all of the major ES providers worldwide. We comment on our 
      experience in generating these mouse lines; providing a snapshot of a "clients" 
      perspective of using the IKMC resource and one which we hope will serve as a 
      guide to other institutions or organisations contemplating establishing a similar 
      centralised service.

AB  - The morphology of plant root anatomical features is a key factor in effective 
      water and nutrient uptake. Existing techniques for phenotyping root anatomical 
      traits are often based on manual or semi-automatic segmentation and annotation of 
      microscopic images of root cross sections. In this article, we propose a fully 
      automated tool, hereinafter referred to as RootAnalyzer, for efficiently 
      extracting and analyzing anatomical traits from root-cross section images. Using 
      a range of image processing techniques such as local thresholding and nearest 
      neighbor identification, RootAnalyzer segments the plant root from the image's 
      background, classifies and characterizes the cortex, stele, endodermis and 
      epidermis, and subsequently produces statistics about the morphological 
      properties of the root cells and tissues. We use RootAnalyzer to analyze 15 
      images of wheat plants and one maize plant image and evaluate its performance 
      against manually-obtained ground truth data. The comparison shows that 
      RootAnalyzer can fully characterize most root tissue regions with over 90% 
      accuracy.

AB  - Precision medicine requires appropriate application of genomics in clinical 
      practice. In cancer, we have witnessed practice-changing examples of how genomic 
      knowledge is translated into more tailored and effective therapies. The next 
      opportunity is to embed cancer genomics in clinical context so that 
      patient-centric longitudinal clinical, genomic, and molecular phenotypes can be 
      compiled for adaptive learning between precision medicine research and clinical 
      care with the goal of accelerating clinically-actionable discoveries. We describe 
      here an adaptive learning platform, APOLLO™ (adaptive patient-oriented 
      longitudinal learning and optimization) designed to integrate genomic research in 
      the context of, but not in the path of, routine and investigational clinical care 
      for purposes of enabling data-driven discovery across disciplines such that every 
      patient can contribute to and potentially benefit from research discoveries.

TI  - Phenome-driven disease genetics prediction toward drug discovery.
PG  - i276-83
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv245 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Discerning genetic contributions to diseases not only enhances our 
      understanding of disease mechanisms, but also leads to translational 
      opportunities for drug discovery. Recent computational approaches incorporate 
      disease phenotypic similarities to improve the prediction power of disease gene 
      discovery. However, most current studies used only one data source of human 
      disease phenotype. We present an innovative and generic strategy for combining 
      multiple different data sources of human disease phenotype and predicting 
      disease-associated genes from integrated phenotypic and genomic data. RESULTS: To 
      demonstrate our approach, we explored a new phenotype database from biomedical 
      ontologies and constructed Disease Manifestation Network (DMN). We combined DMN 
      with mimMiner, which was a widely used phenotype database in disease gene 
      prediction studies. Our approach achieved significantly improved performance over 
      a baseline method, which used only one phenotype data source. In the 
      leave-one-out cross-validation and de novo gene prediction analysis, our approach 
      achieved the area under the curves of 90.7% and 90.3%, which are significantly 
      higher than 84.2% (P < e(-4)) and 81.3% (P < e(-12)) for the baseline approach. 
      We further demonstrated that our predicted genes have the translational potential 
      in drug discovery. We used Crohn's disease as an example and ranked the candidate 
      drugs based on the rank of drug targets. Our gene prediction approach prioritized 
      druggable genes that are likely to be associated with Crohn's disease 
      pathogenesis, and our rank of candidate drugs successfully prioritized the Food 
      and Drug Administration-approved drugs for Crohn's disease. We also found 
      literature evidence to support a number of drugs among the top 200 candidates. In 
      summary, we demonstrated that a novel strategy combining unique disease phenotype 
      data with system approaches can lead to rapid drug discovery. AVAILABILITY AND

TI  - Three-dimensional human facial morphologies as robust aging markers.
PG  - 574-87
LID - 10.1038/cr.2015.36 [doi]
AB  - Aging is associated with many complex diseases. Reliable prediction of the aging 
      process is important for assessing the risks of aging-associated diseases. 
      However, despite intense research, so far there is no reliable aging marker. Here 
      we addressed this problem by examining whether human 3D facial imaging features 
      could be used as reliable aging markers. We collected > 300 3D human facial 
      images and blood profiles well-distributed across ages of 17 to 77 years. By 
      analyzing the morphological profiles, we generated the first comprehensive map of 
      the aging human facial phenome. We identified quantitative facial features, such 
      as eye slopes, highly associated with age. We constructed a robust age predictor 
      and found that on average people of the same chronological age differ by ± 6 
      years in facial age, with the deviations increasing after age 40. Using this 
      predictor, we identified slow and fast agers that are significantly supported by 
      levels of health indicators. Despite a close relationship between facial 
      morphological features and health indicators in the blood, facial features are 
      more reliable aging biomarkers than blood profiles and can better reflect the 
      general health status than chronological age.

TI  - PhenoMeter: A Metabolome Database Search Tool Using Statistical Similarity 
      Matching of Metabolic Phenotypes for High-Confidence Detection of Functional 
      Links.
PG  - 106
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2015.00106 [doi]
LID - 106
AB  - This article describes PhenoMeter (PM), a new type of metabolomics database 
      search that accepts metabolite response patterns as queries and searches the 
      MetaPhen database of reference patterns for responses that are statistically 
      significantly similar or inverse for the purposes of detecting functional links. 
      To identify a similarity measure that would detect functional links as reliably 
      as possible, we compared the performance of four statistics in correctly 
      top-matching metabolic phenotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana metabolism mutants 
      affected in different steps of the photorespiration metabolic pathway to 
      reference phenotypes of mutants affected in the same enzymes by independent 
      mutations. The best performing statistic, the PM score, was a function of both 
      Pearson correlation and Fisher's Exact Test of directional overlap. This 
      statistic outperformed Pearson correlation, biweight midcorrelation and Fisher's 
      Exact Test used alone. To demonstrate general applicability, we show that the PM 
      reliably retrieved the most closely functionally linked response in the database 
      when queried with responses to a wide variety of environmental and genetic 
      perturbations. Attempts to match metabolic phenotypes between independent studies 
      were met with varying success and possible reasons for this are discussed. 
      Overall, our results suggest that integration of pattern-based search tools into 
      metabolomics databases will aid functional annotation of newly recorded metabolic 
      phenotypes analogously to the way sequence similarity search algorithms have 
      aided the functional annotation of genes and proteins. PM is freely available at 
      MetabolomeExpress (https://www.metabolome-express.org/phenometer.php).

TI  - Integrating Image-Based Phenomics and Association Analysis to Dissect the Genetic 
      Architecture of Temporal Salinity Responses in Rice.
PG  - 1476-89
LID - 10.1104/pp.15.00450 [doi]
AB  - Salinity affects a significant portion of arable land and is particularly 
      detrimental for irrigated agriculture, which provides one-third of the global 
      food supply. Rice (Oryza sativa), the most important food crop, is salt 
      sensitive. The genetic resources for salt tolerance in rice germplasm exist but 
      are underutilized due to the difficulty in capturing the dynamic nature of 
      physiological responses to salt stress. The genetic basis of these physiological 
      responses is predicted to be polygenic. In an effort to address this challenge, 
      we generated temporal imaging data from 378 diverse rice genotypes across 14 d of 
      90 mm NaCl stress and developed a statistical model to assess the genetic 
      architecture of dynamic salinity-induced growth responses in rice germplasm. A 
      genomic region on chromosome 3 was strongly associated with the early growth 
      response and was captured using visible range imaging. Fluorescence imaging 
      identified four genomic regions linked to salinity-induced fluorescence 
      responses. A region on chromosome 1 regulates both the fluorescence shift 
      indicative of the longer term ionic stress and the early growth rate decline 
      during salinity stress. We present, to our knowledge, a new approach to capture 
      the dynamic plant responses to its environment and elucidate the genetic basis of 
      these responses using a longitudinal genome-wide association model.

TI  - RootGraph: a graphic optimization tool for automated image analysis of plant 
      roots.
PG  - 6551-62
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erv359 [doi]
AB  - This paper outlines a numerical scheme for accurate, detailed, and 
      high-throughput image analysis of plant roots. In contrast to existing root image 
      analysis tools that focus on root system-average traits, a novel, fully automated 
      and robust approach for the detailed characterization of root traits, based on a 
      graph optimization process is presented. The scheme, firstly, distinguishes 
      primary roots from lateral roots and, secondly, quantifies a broad spectrum of 
      root traits for each identified primary and lateral root. Thirdly, it associates 
      lateral roots and their properties with the specific primary root from which the 
      laterals emerge. The performance of this approach was evaluated through 
      comparisons with other automated and semi-automated software solutions as well as 
      against results based on manual measurements. The comparisons and subsequent 
      application of the algorithm to an array of experimental data demonstrate that 
      this method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and 
      the ability to process root images under high-throughput conditions.

AB  - Small molecules often affect multiple targets, elicit off-target effects, and 
      induce genotype-specific responses. Chemical genetics, the mapping of the 
      genotype dependence of a small molecule's effects across a broad spectrum of 
      phenotypes can identify novel mechanisms of action. It can also reveal 
      unanticipated effects and could thereby reduce high attrition rates of small 
      molecule development pipelines. Here, we used high-content screening and image 
      analysis to measure effects of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds on 
      complex phenotypes in isogenic cancer cell lines which harbor activating or 
      inactivating mutations in key oncogenic signaling pathways. Using multiparametric 
      chemical-genetic interaction analysis, we observed phenotypic gene-drug 
      interactions for more than 193 compounds, with many affecting phenotypes other 
      than cell growth. We created a resource termed the Pharmacogenetic Phenome 
      Compendium (PGPC), which enables exploration of drug mode of action, detection of 
      potential off-target effects, and the generation of hypotheses on drug 
      combinations and synergism. For example, we demonstrate that MEK inhibitors 
      amplify the viability effect of the clinically used anti-alcoholism drug 
      disulfiram and show that the EGFR inhibitor tyrphostin AG555 has off-target 
      activity on the proteasome. Taken together, this study demonstrates how combining 
      multiparametric phenotyping in different genetic backgrounds can be used to 
      predict additional mechanisms of action and to reposition clinically used drugs.

TI  - Temperament type specific metabolite profiles of the prefrontal cortex and serum

AB  - In the past decade the number of studies investigating temperament in farm 
      animals has increased greatly because temperament has been shown not only to 
      affect handling but also reproduction, health and economically important 
      production traits. However, molecular pathways underlying temperament and 
      molecular pathways linking temperament to production traits, health and 
      reproduction have yet to be studied in full detail. Here we report the results of 
      metabolite profiling of the prefrontal cortex and serum of cattle with distinct 
      temperament types that were performed to further explore their molecular 
      divergence in the response to the slaughter procedure and to identify new targets 
      for further research of cattle temperament. By performing an untargeted 
      comprehensive metabolite profiling, 627 and 1097 metabolite features comprising 
      235 and 328 metabolites could be detected in the prefrontal cortex and serum, 
      respectively. In total, 54 prefrontal cortex and 51 serum metabolite features 
      were indicated to have a high relevance in the classification of temperament 
      types by a sparse partial least square discriminant analysis. A clear 
      discrimination between fearful/neophobic-alert, interested-stressed, 
      subdued/uninterested-calm and outgoing/neophilic-alert temperament types could be 
      observed based on the abundance of the identified relevant prefrontal cortex and 
      serum metabolites. Metabolites with high relevance in the classification of 
      temperament types revealed that the main differences between temperament types in 
      the response to the slaughter procedure were related to the abundance of 
      glycerophospholipids, fatty acyls and sterol lipids. Differences in the abundance 
      of metabolites related to C21 steroid metabolism and oxidative stress indicated 
      that the differences in the metabolite profiles of the four extreme temperament 
      types could be the result of a temperament type specific regulation of molecular 
      pathways that are known to be involved in the stress and fear response.

TI  - Image-based estimation of oat panicle development using local texture patterns.
PG  - 433-443
LID - 10.1071/FP14056 [doi]
AB  - Flowering time varies between and within species, profoundly influencing 
      reproductive fitness in wild plants and productivity in crop plants. The time of 
      flowering, therefore, is an important statistic that is regularly collected as 
      part of breeding programs and phenotyping experiments to facilitate comparison of 
      genotypes and treatments. Its automatic detection would be highly desirable. We 
      present significant progress on an approach to this problem in oats (Avena sativa 
      L.), an underdeveloped cereal crop of increasing importance. Making use of the 
      many thousands of images of oat plants we have available, spanning different 
      genotypes and treatments, we observe that during flowering, panicles (the 
      flowering structures) betray particular intensity patterns that give an 
      identifiable texture that is distinctive and discriminatory with respect to the 
      main plant body and can be used to determine the time of flowering. This texture 
      can be located by a filter, trained as a form of local pattern. This training 
      phase identifies the best parameters of such a filter, which usefully discovers 
      the scale of the panicle spikelets. The results demonstrate the success of the 
      filter. We proceed to suggest and evaluate an approach to using the filter as a 
      growth stage detector. Preliminary results show very good correspondence with 
      hand-measured ground truth, and are amenable to improvement in several ways. 
      Future work will build on this initial success and will go on to locate fully 
      mature panicles, which have a different appearance, and assess whether this 
      approach can be extended to a broader range of plants.

TI  - Detailed Anatomical Orientations for Certain Types of Morphometric Measurements 
      Can Be Determined Automatically With Geometric Algorithms.
PG  - 1816-23
LID - 10.1002/ar.23202 [doi]
AB  - Morphometric datasets only convey useful information about variation when 
      measurement landmarks and relevant anatomical axes are clearly defined. We 
      propose that anatomical axes of 3D digital models of bones can be standardized 
      prior to measurement using an algorithm that automatically finds a universal 
      geometric alignment among sampled bones. As a case study, we use teeth of 
      "prosimian" primates. In this sample, equivalent occlusal planes are determined 
      automatically using the R-package auto3dgm. The area of projection into the 
      occlusal plane for each tooth is the measurement of interest. This area is used 
      in computation of a shape metric called relief index (RFI), the natural log of 
      the square root of crown area divided by the square root of occlusal plane 
      projection area. We compare mean and variance parameters of area and RFI values 
      computed from these automatically orientated tooth models with values computed 
      from manually orientated tooth models. According to our results, the manual and 
      automated approaches yield extremely similar mean and variance parameters. The 
      only differences that plausibly modify interpretations of biological meaning 
      slightly favor the automated treatment because a greater proportion of 
      differences among subsamples in the automated treatment are correlated with 
      dietary differences. We conclude that-at least for dental topographic 
      metrics-automated alignment recovers a variance pattern that has meaning similar 
      to previously published datasets based on manual data collection. Therefore, 
      future applications of dental topography can take advantage of automatic 
      alignment to increase objectivity and repeatability.

TI  - Large-Scale Phenomics Identifies Primary and Fine-Tuning Roles for CRKs in 
      Responses Related to Oxidative Stress.
PG  - e1005373
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005373 [doi]
LID - e1005373
AB  - Cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (CRKs) are transmembrane proteins 
      characterized by the presence of two domains of unknown function 26 (DUF26) in 
      their ectodomain. The CRKs form one of the largest groups of receptor-like 
      protein kinases in plants, but their biological functions have so far remained 
      largely uncharacterized. We conducted a large-scale phenotyping approach of a 
      nearly complete crk T-DNA insertion line collection showing that CRKs control 
      important aspects of plant development and stress adaptation in response to 
      biotic and abiotic stimuli in a non-redundant fashion. In particular, the 
      analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related stress responses, such as 
      regulation of the stomatal aperture, suggests that CRKs participate in ROS/redox 
      signalling and sensing. CRKs play general and fine-tuning roles in the regulation 
      of stomatal closure induced by microbial and abiotic cues. Despite their great 
      number and high similarity, large-scale phenotyping identified specific functions 
      in diverse processes for many CRKs and indicated that CRK2 and CRK5 play 
      predominant roles in growth regulation and stress adaptation, respectively. As a 
      whole, the CRKs contribute to specificity in ROS signalling. Individual CRKs 
      control distinct responses in an antagonistic fashion suggesting future potential 
      for using CRKs in genetic approaches to improve plant performance and stress 
      tolerance.

TI  - Birth month affects lifetime disease risk: a phenome-wide method.
PG  - 1042-53
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv046 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: An individual's birth month has a significant impact on the diseases 
      they develop during their lifetime. Previous studies reveal relationships between 
      birth month and several diseases including atherothrombosis, asthma, attention 
      deficit hyperactivity disorder, and myopia, leaving most diseases completely 
      unexplored. This retrospective population study systematically explores the 
      relationship between seasonal affects at birth and lifetime disease risk for 1688 
      conditions. METHODS: We developed a hypothesis-free method that minimizes 
      publication and disease selection biases by systematically investigating 
      disease-birth month patterns across all conditions. Our dataset includes 1 749 
      400 individuals with records at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical 
      Center born between 1900 and 2000 inclusive. We modeled associations between 
      birth month and 1688 diseases using logistic regression. Significance was tested 
      using a chi-squared test with multiplicity correction. RESULTS: We found 55 
      diseases that were significantly dependent on birth month. Of these 19 were 
      previously reported in the literature (P < .001), 20 were for conditions with 
      close relationships to those reported, and 16 were previously unreported. We 
      found distinct incidence patterns across disease categories. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Lifetime disease risk is affected by birth month. Seasonally dependent early 
      developmental mechanisms may play a role in increasing lifetime risk of disease.

AB  - Unprecedented developments in legume genomics over the last decade have resulted 
      in the acquisition of a wide range of modern genomic resources to underpin 
      genetic improvement of grain legumes. The genome enabled insights direct 
      investigators in various ways that primarily include unearthing novel structural 
      variations, retrieving the lost genetic diversity, introducing novel/exotic 
      alleles from wider gene pools, finely resolving the complex quantitative traits 
      and so forth. To this end, ready availability of cost-efficient and high-density 
      genotyping assays allows genome wide prediction to be increasingly recognized as 
      the key selection criterion in crop breeding. Further, the high-dimensional 
      measurements of agronomically significant phenotypes obtained by using 
      new-generation screening techniques will empower reference based resequencing as 
      well as allele mining and trait mapping methods to comprehensively associate 
      genome diversity with the phenome scale variation. Besides stimulating the 
      forward genetic systems, accessibility to precisely delineated genomic segments 
      reveals novel candidates for reverse genetic techniques like targeted genome 
      editing. The shifting paradigm in plant genomics in turn necessitates 
      optimization of crop breeding strategies to enable the most efficient integration 
      of advanced omics knowledge and tools. We anticipate that the crop improvement 
      schemes will be bolstered remarkably with rational deployment of these 
      genome-guided approaches, ultimately resulting in expanded plant breeding 
      capacities and improved crop performance.

TI  - Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred data resources in the Mouse Phenome 
      Database.
PG  - 511-20
LID - 10.1007/s00335-015-9595-6 [doi]
AB  - The Mouse Phenome Database was originally conceived as a platform for the 
      integration of phenotype data collected on a defined collection of 40 inbred 
      mouse strains--the "phenome panel." This model provided an impetus for community 
      data sharing, and integration was readily achieved through the reproducible 
      genotypes of the phenome panel strains. Advances in the development of mouse 
      populations lead to an expanded role of the Mouse Phenome Database to encompass 
      new strain panels and inbred strain crosses. The recent introduction of the 
      Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred mice, which share an extensive pool of 
      genetic variation from eight founder inbred strains, presents new opportunities 
      and challenges for community data resources. A wide variety of molecular and 
      clinical phenotypes are being collected across genotypes, tissues, ages, 
      environmental exposures, interventions, and treatments. The Mouse Phenome 
      Database provides a framework for retrieval, integration, analysis, and display 
      of these data, enabling them to be evaluated in the context of existing data from 
      standard inbred strains. Primary data in the Mouse Phenome Database are supported 
      by extensive metadata on protocols and procedures. These are centrally curated to 
      ensure accuracy and reproducibility and to provide data in consistent formats. 
      The Mouse Phenome Database represents an established and growing community data 
      resource for mouse phenotype data and encourages submissions from new mouse 
      resources, enabling investigators to integrate existing data into their studies 
      of the phenotypic consequences of genetic variation.

PG  - e0136387

LID - e0136387
AB  - Escherichia coli is a major etiological agent of intra-mammary infections (IMI) 
      in cows, leading to acute mastitis and causing great economic losses in dairy 
      production worldwide. Particular strains cause persistent IMI, leading to 
      recurrent mastitis. Virulence factors of mammary pathogenic E. coli (MPEC) 
      involved pathogenesis of mastitis as well as those differentiating strains 
      causing acute or persistent mastitis are largely unknown. This study aimed to 
      identify virulence markers in MPEC through whole genome and phenome comparative 
      analysis. MPEC strains causing acute (VL2874 and P4) or persistent (VL2732) 
      mastitis were compared to an environmental strain (K71) and to the genomes of 
      strains representing different E. coli pathotypes. Intra-mammary challenge in 
      mice confirmed experimentally that the strains studied here have different 
      pathogenic potential, and that the environmental strain K71 is non-pathogenic in 
      the mammary gland. Analysis of whole genome sequences and predicted proteomes 
      revealed high similarity among MPEC, whereas MPEC significantly differed from the 
      non-mammary pathogenic strain K71, and from E. coli genomes from other 
      pathotypes. Functional features identified in MPEC genomes and lacking in the 
      non-mammary pathogenic strain were associated with synthesis of 
      lipopolysaccharide and other membrane antigens, ferric-dicitrate iron acquisition 
      and sugars metabolism. Features associated with cytotoxicity or intra-cellular 
      survival were found specifically in the genomes of strains from severe and acute 
      (VL2874) or persistent (VL2732) mastitis, respectively. MPEC genomes were 
      relatively similar to strain K-12, which was subsequently shown here to be 
      possibly pathogenic in the mammary gland. Phenome analysis showed that the 
      persistent MPEC was the most versatile in terms of nutrients metabolized and 
      acute MPEC the least. Among phenotypes unique to MPEC compared to the non-mammary 
      pathogenic strain were uric acid and D-serine metabolism. This study reveals 
      virulence factors and phenotypic characteristics of MPEC that may play a role in 
      pathogenesis of E. coli mastitis.

TI  - Towards a conceptual ABA ideotype in plant breeding for water limited 
      environments.
PG  - 502-513
LID - 10.1071/FP14334 [doi]
AB  - A huge amount of information had been accumulated on abscisic acid (ABA). 
      Laboratory and some field research with ABA-enhanced transgenic plants generally 
      conclude that ABA is a drought resistance hormone, since it causes stomatal 
      closure, reduces transpiration and results in 'water saving' under drought 
      stress. This recurring conclusion is hard to accept in the agronomic domain 
      considering the many direct and indirect negative effects of ABA on plant growth 
      and reproduction. In order to formulate a conceptual phenotypic ABA ideotype for 
      plant breeding, this paper begins by briefly reviewing the phenomics of ABA 
      relative to plant function and productivity. Consequently, it is recognised that 
      ABA enhancement is important in controlling the isohydric ('water saving') plant 
      model, whereas plant hydraulics are more important in controlling the anisohydric 
      ('water spending') plant model. Subsequently, the respective isohydric and 
      anisohydric ideotypes appropriate to specific dryland crop drought stress 
      scenarios are proposed. It is concluded that ABA can by no means be universally 
      defined as a 'drought resistance hormone'. Its benefit or damage depends on the 
      crop drought stress profile and the dynamics of the seasonal regimen of ABA in

      environments, whereas the anisohydric one will perform relatively better under 
      more moderate drought conditions.

TI  - The phenome-wide distribution of genetic variance.
PG  - 15-30

AB  - A general observation emerging from estimates of additive genetic variance in 
      sets of functionally or developmentally related traits is that much of the 
      genetic variance is restricted to few trait combinations as a consequence of 
      genetic covariance among traits. While this biased distribution of genetic 
      variance among functionally related traits is now well documented, how it 
      translates to the broader phenome and therefore any trait combination under 
      selection in a given environment is unknown. We show that 8,750 gene expression 
      traits measured in adult male Drosophila serrata exhibit widespread genetic 
      covariance among random sets of five traits, implying that pleiotropy is common. 
      Ultimately, to understand the phenome-wide distribution of genetic variance, very 
      large additive genetic variance-covariance matrices (G) are required to be 
      estimated. We draw upon recent advances in matrix theory for completing 
      high-dimensional matrices to estimate the 8,750-trait G and show that large 
      numbers of gene expression traits genetically covary as a consequence of a single 
      genetic factor. Using gene ontology term enrichment analysis, we show that the 
      major axis of genetic variance among expression traits successfully identified 
      genetic covariance among genes involved in multiple modes of transcriptional 
      regulation. Our approach provides a practical empirical framework for the genetic 
      analysis of high-dimensional phenome-wide trait sets and for the investigation of 
      the extent of high-dimensional genetic constraint.

AB  - Multiphenotype genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may reveal pleiotropic 
      genes, which would remain undetected using single phenotype analyses. Analysis of 
      large pedigrees offers the added advantage of more accurately assessing trait 
      heritability, which can help prioritise genetically influenced phenotypes for 
      GWAS analysis. In this study we performed a principal component analysis (PCA), 
      heritability (h2) estimation and pedigree-based GWAS of 37 cardiovascular disease 
      -related phenotypes in 330 related individuals forming a large pedigree from the 
      Norfolk Island genetic isolate. PCA revealed 13 components explaining >75% of the 
      total variance. Nine components yielded statistically significant h2 values 
      ranging from 0.22 to 0.54 (P<0.05). The most heritable component was loaded with 
      7 phenotypic measures reflecting metabolic and renal dysfunction. A GWAS of this 
      composite phenotype revealed statistically significant associations for 3 
      adjacent SNPs on chromosome 1p22.2 (P<1x10-8). These SNPs form a 42kb haplotype 
      block and explain 11% of the genetic variance for this renal function phenotype. 
      Replication analysis of the tagging SNP (rs1396315) in an independent US cohort 
      supports the association (P = 0.000011). Blood transcript analysis showed 35 
      genes were associated with rs1396315 (P<0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis of 
      these genes revealed the most enriched pathway was purine metabolism (P = 
      0.0015). Overall, our findings provide convincing evidence for a major 
      pleiotropic effect locus on chromosome 1p22.2 influencing risk of renal 
      dysfunction via purine metabolism pathways in the Norfolk Island population. 
      Further studies are now warranted to interrogate the functional relevance of this 
      locus in terms of renal pathology and cardiovascular disease risk.

TI  - Myocardial and cardiomyocyte stress resilience is enhanced in aromatase-deficient 
      female mouse hearts through CaMKIIδ activation.
PG  - 1429-40
LID - 10.1210/en.2014-1700 [doi]
AB  - The role of sex steroids in cardioprotection is contentious, with large clinical 
      trials investigating hormone supplementation failing to deliver outcomes expected 
      from observational studies. Mechanistic understanding of androgen/estrogen 
      myocardial actions is lacking. Using a genetic model of aromatase tissue 
      deficiency (ArKO) in female mice, the goal of this investigation was to evaluate 
      the capacity of a shift in cardiac endogenous steroid conversion to influence 
      ischemia-reperfusion resilience by optimizing cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling 
      responses. In isolated normoxic cardiomyocytes, basal Ca2+ transient amplitude 
      and extent of shortening were greater in ArKO myocytes, with preservation of 
      diastolic Ca2+ levels. Isolated ArKO cardiomyocytes exposed to a high Ca2+ load 
      exhibited greater Ca2+ transient and contractile amplitudes, associated with a 
      greater postrest spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ load-release. Microarray 
      differential gene expression analysis of normoxic ventricular tissues from ArKO 
      vs wild-type identified a significant influence of aromatase on genes involved in 
      cardiac Ca2+ handling and signaling [including calmodulin dependent kinase II 
      (CaMKII)-δ], myofilament structure and function, glucose uptake and signaling, 
      and enzymes controlling phosphorylation-specific posttranslational modification 
      status. CaMKII expression was not changed in ventricular tissues, although 
      CaMKIIδ activation and phosphorylation of downstream targets was enhanced in ArKO 
      hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. Overall, this investigation shows that 
      relative withdrawal of estrogen in favor of testosterone through genetically 
      induced tissue aromatase deficiency in females modifies the gene expression 
      profile to effect inotropic support via optimized Ca2+ handling in response to 
      stress, with a modest impact on basal function. Consideration of aromatase 
      inhibition, acutely or chronically, may have a role in cardioprotection, of 
      particular relevance to women.

      difficult, which has hampered surveys of potential biases in the methodology in 
      the past. Addressing this issue, we created a large cohort of mice with 
      biological replicates enabling the confident calling of induced mutations, which 
      in turn allowed us to conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential biases in 
      mutation properties and genomic location. RESULTS: In the exome sequencing data 
      we observe the known preference of ENU to cause A:T=>G:C transitions in longer 
      genes. Mutations were frequently clustered and inherited in blocks hampering 
      attempts to pinpoint individual causative mutations by genome analysis only. 
      Furthermore, ENU mutations were biased towards areas in the genome that are 
      accessible in testis, potentially limiting the scope of forward genetic 
      approaches to only 1-10% of the genome. CONCLUSION: ENU provides a powerful tool 
      for exploring the genome-phenome relationship, however forward genetic 
      applications that require the mutation to be passed on through the germ line may 
      be limited to explore only genes that are accessible in testis.

TI  - Variants in Ion Channel Genes Link Phenotypic Features of Bipolar Illness to 
      Specific Neurobiological Process Domains.
PG  - 23-35
LID - 10.1159/000371886 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in genome-wide association studies are pointing towards a major 
      role for voltage-gated ion channels in neuropsychiatric disorders and, in 
      particular, bipolar disorder (BD). The phenotype of BD is complex, with symptoms 
      during mood episodes and deficits persisting between episodes. We have tried to 
      elucidate the common neurobiological mechanisms associated with ion channel 
      signaling in order to provide a new perspective on the clinical symptoms and 
      possible endophenotypes seen in BD patients. We propose a model in which the 
      multiple variants in genes coding for ion channel proteins would perturb 
      motivational circuits, synaptic plasticity, myelination, 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, circadian neuronal rhythms, and 
      energy regulation. These changes in neurobiological mechanisms would manifest in 
      endophenotypes of aberrant reward processing, white matter hyperintensities, 
      deficits in executive function, altered frontolimbic connectivity, increased 
      amygdala activity, increased melatonin suppression, decreased REM latency, and 
      aberrant myo-inositol/ATP shuttling. The endophenotypes result in behaviors of 
      poor impulse control, motivational changes, cognitive deficits, abnormal stress 
      response, sleep disturbances, and energy changes involving different 
      neurobiological process domains. The hypothesis is that these disturbances start 
      with altered neural circuitry during development, following which multiple 
      environmental triggers may disrupt the neuronal excitability balance through an 
      activity-dependent molecular process, resulting in clinical mood episodes.

AB  - A new framework in which the multiple levels of molecular variations contribute 
      to phenotypic variations in a complex, nonlinear and interactive way, challenges 
      the hierarchical nature of the relationships between the genotypic and phenotypic 
      spaces. This individual-centered framework provides new insights on the 
      evolutionary mechanisms involved in the production of phenotypes. We propose to 
      move this research agenda forward by combining selection experiments and 
      functional genetics.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous and progressive 
      inflammatory condition that has been linked to the dysregulation of many 
      metabolic pathways including lipid biosynthesis. How lipid metabolism could 
      affect disease progression in smokers with COPD remains unclear. We 
      cross-examined the transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics data 
      available on the public domain to elucidate the mechanisms by which lipid 
      metabolism is perturbed in COPD. We reconstructed a sputum lipid COPD (SpLiCO) 
      signaling network utilizing active/inactive, and functional/dysfunctional 
      lipid-mediated signaling pathways to explore how lipid-metabolism could promote 
      COPD pathogenesis in smokers. SpLiCO was further utilized to investigate signal 
      amplifiers, distributers, propagators, feed-forward and/or -back loops that link 
      COPD disease severity and hypoxia to disruption in the metabolism of 
      sphingolipids, fatty acids and energy. Also, hypergraph analysis and calculations 
      for dependency of molecules identified several important nodes in the network 
      with modular regulatory and signal distribution activities. Our systems-based 
      analyses indicate that arachidonic acid is a critical and early signal 
      distributer that is upregulated by the sphingolipid signaling pathway in COPD, 
      while hypoxia plays a critical role in the elevated dependency to glucose as a 
      major energy source. Integration of SpLiCo and clinical data shows a strong 
      association between hypoxia and the upregulation of sphingolipids in smokers with 
      emphysema, vascular disease, hypertension and those with increased risk of lung 
      cancer.

TI  - Applications of seaweed extracts in Australian agriculture: past, present and 
      future.
PG  - 2007-2015
AB  - A rapidly growing world population has highlighted the need to significantly 
      increase food production in the context of a world with accelerating soil and 
      water shortages as well as climatic stressors. This situation has generated new 
      interest in the application of liquid seaweed extracts because of their potent 
      plant growth-enhancing properties through metabolic benefits, triggering disease 
      response pathways and increasing stress tolerance. The basis for these benefits 
      is complex and poorly understood. Liquid seaweed extracts are complex and have 
      been demonstrated to possess novel mechanisms for increasing crop productivity. 
      The benefits of seaweed extracts to crops have previously been reviewed in the 
      context of the northern hemisphere, but not in the context of Australia, its 
      crops and unique stressors. This review considers the application of seaweed 
      extracts in Australian agriculture by (i) introducing the history of the 
      Australian liquid seaweed extract industry and (ii) focusing on evidence of 
      Australian research related to seaweed extract composition, plant growth 
      properties during plant establishment, pathogenic disease and new approaches to 
      phenotyping the biological efficacy of seaweed extracts. This type of research is 
      essential for future Australian agriculture to develop effective strategies for 
      the use of liquid seaweed extracts.

LID - 15147
AB  - Bacterial phenotypic traits and lifestyles in response to diverse environmental 
      conditions depend on changes in the internal molecular environment. However, 
      predicting bacterial adaptability is still difficult outside of laboratory 
      controlled conditions. Many molecular levels can contribute to the adaptation to 
      a changing environment: pathway structure, codon usage, metabolism. To measure 
      adaptability to changing environmental conditions and over time, we develop a 
      multi-omic model of Escherichia coli that accounts for metabolism, gene 
      expression and codon usage at both transcription and translation levels. After 
      the integration of multiple omics into the model, we propose a multiobjective 
      optimization algorithm to find the allowable and optimal metabolic phenotypes 
      through concurrent maximization or minimization of multiple metabolic markers. In 
      the condition space, we propose Pareto hypervolume and spectral analysis as 
      estimators of short term multi-omic (transcriptomic and metabolic) evolution, 
      thus enabling comparative analysis of metabolic conditions. We therefore compare, 
      evaluate and cluster different experimental conditions, models and bacterial 
      strains according to their metabolic response in a multidimensional objective 
      space, rather than in the original space of microarray data. We finally validate 
      our methods on a phenomics dataset of growth conditions. Our framework, named 
      METRADE, is freely available as a MATLAB toolbox.

TI  - SMART on FHIR Genomics: facilitating standardized clinico-genomic apps.
PG  - 1173-8
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv045 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Supporting clinical decision support for personalized medicine will 
      require linking genome and phenome variants to a patient's electronic health 
      record (EHR), at times on a vast scale. Clinico-genomic data standards will be 
      needed to unify how genomic variant data are accessed from different sequencing 
      systems. METHODS: A specification for the basis of a clinic-genomic standard, 
      building upon the current Health Level Seven International Fast Healthcare 
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standard, was developed. An FHIR application 
      protocol interface (API) layer was attached to proprietary sequencing platforms 
      and EHRs in order to expose gene variant data for presentation to the end-user. 
      Three representative apps based on the SMART platform were built to test 
      end-to-end feasibility, including integration of genomic and clinical data. 
      RESULTS: Successful design, deployment, and use of the API was demonstrated and 
      adopted by HL7 Clinical Genomics Workgroup. Feasibility was shown through 
      development of three apps by various types of users with background levels and 
      locations. CONCLUSION: This prototyping work suggests that an entirely data (and 
      web) standards-based approach could prove both effective and efficient for 
      advancing personalized medicine.

LID - 10.1016/j.jprot.2015.03.010 [doi]
AB  - The high pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus is thought to be due to its 
      extraordinary capacity to rapidly adapt to changes in environmental conditions. 
      This study was carried out to investigate whether the cytoplasmic profiles of 
      metabolites and proteins of S. aureus were altered in response to prolonged 
      exposure to cold stress. Metabolic profiling and proteomics were used to 
      characterise alterations in cytoplasmic proteins and metabolites in cells from 
      the mid-exponential phase of growth under ideal conditions at 37°C and compared 
      with equivalent cells exposed to prolonged cold stress for 2 weeks at 4°C. 
      Principle component analysis (PCA) of the metabolomic and proteomic data 
      indicated that, at the mid-exponential phase of growth, prolonged cold stress 
      conditions generated cells with different metabolite and protein profiles 
      compared with those grown at 37°C. Nine ribosomal proteins and citric acid were 
      substantially elevated in the cytoplasmic fractions from the cells adapted to 
      cold-stress but most amino acids showed a reduction in their concentration in 
      cold-stressed samples. The data provided strong evidence supporting the 
      hypothesis that specific changes in metabolic homeostasis and protein composition 
      were critical to the adaptive processes required for survival under cold stress. 
      BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Work in our laboratory has shown that prolonged exposure 
      of S. aureus to cold stress can result in the formation of small colony variants 
      (SCVs) associated with significant alterations in the cell wall composition. 
      Further studies revealed that S. aureus altered cell size and cell wall thickness 
      in response to exposure to cold temperatures, alterations in pH and exposure to 
      antibiotics. The current study has utilised the prolonged exposure to cold stress 
      as a model system to explore changes in the proteome and associated metabolic 
      homeostasis following environmental challenges. The study provides an improved 
      understanding of how S. aureus adapts to the changing environment whilst in 
      transition between human hosts. The results indicated an unexpected production of 
      9 ribosomal proteins and citric acid in response to cold stress suggesting 
      specific survival roles for these proteins and citric acid as an adaptation 
      mechanism for empowering survival under these conditions.

TI  - Phenotyping Stroke in Sub-Saharan Africa: Stroke Investigative Research and 
      Education Network (SIREN) Phenomics Protocol.
PG  - 73-82
LID - 10.1159/000437372 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the second leading cause of death and the leading cause of 
      adult-onset disability, stroke is a major public health concern particularly 
      pertinent in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where nearly 80% of all global stroke 
      mortalities occur, and stroke burden is projected to increase in the coming 
      decades. However, traditional and emerging risk factors for stroke in SSA have 
      not been well characterized, thus limiting efforts at curbing its devastating 
      toll. The Stroke Investigative Research and Education Network (SIREN) project is 
      aimed at comprehensively evaluating the key environmental and genomic risk 
      factors for stroke (and its subtypes) in SSA while simultaneously building 
      capacities in phenomics, biobanking, genomics, biostatistics, and bioinformatics 
      for brain research. METHODS: SIREN is a transnational, multicentre, hospital and 
      community-based study involving 3,000 cases and 3,000 controls recruited from 8 
      sites in Ghana and Nigeria. Cases will be hospital-based patients with first 
      stroke within 10 days of onset in whom neurovascular imaging will be performed. 
      Etiological and topographical stroke subtypes will be documented for all cases. 
      Controls will be hospital- and community-based participants, matched to cases on 
      the basis of gender, ethnicity, and age (±5 years). Information will be collected 
      on known and proposed emerging risk factors for stroke. STUDY SIGNIFICANCE: SIREN 
      is the largest study of stroke in Africa to date. It is anticipated that it will 
      shed light on the phenotypic characteristics and risk factors of stroke and 
      ultimately provide evidence base for strategic interventions to curtail the 
      burgeoning burden of stroke on the sub-continent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The domestic dog represents an important model for studying the 
      genetics of behavior. In spite of technological advances in genomics and 
      phenomics, the genetic basis of most specific canine behaviors is largely 
      unknown. Some breeds of hunting dogs exhibit a behavioral trait called "pointing" 
      (a prolonged halt of movement to indicate the position of a game animal). Here, 
      the genomes of pointing dogs (Large Munsterlander and Weimaraner) were compared 
      with those of behaviorally distinct herding dogs (Berger des Pyrenées and 
      Schapendoes). We assumed (i) that these four dog breeds initially represented 
      inbred populations and (ii) that selective breeding for pointing behavior 
      promotes an enrichment of the genetic trait in a homozygous state. RESULTS: The 
      homozygosity mapping of 52 dogs (13 of each of the four breeds) followed by 
      subsequent interval resequencing identified fixed genetic differences on 
      chromosome 22 between pointers and herding dogs. In addition, we identified one 
      non-synonomous variation in each of the coding genes SETDB2 and CYSLTR2 that 
      might have a functional consequence. Genetic analysis of additional hunting and 
      non-hunting dogs revealed consistent homozygosity for these two variations in six 
      of seven pointing breeds. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present findings, we propose 
      that, together with other genetic, training and/or environmental factors, the 
      nucleotide and associated amino acid variations identified in genes SETDB2 and 
      CYSLTR2 contribute to pointing behavior.

AB  - Behavioral tests of animals in a controlled experimental setting provide a 
      valuable tool to advance understanding of genotype-phenotype relations, and to 
      study the effects of genetic and environmental manipulations. To optimally 
      benefit from the increasing numbers of genetically engineered mice, reliable 
      high-throughput methods for comprehensive behavioral phenotyping of mice lines 
      have become a necessity. Here, we describe the development and validation of an 
      anxiety test, the light spot test, that allows for unsupervised, automated, 
      high-throughput testing of mice in a home-cage system. This automated behavioral 
      test circumvents bias introduced by pretest handling, and enables recording both 
      baseline behavior and the behavioral test response over a prolonged period of 
      time. We demonstrate that the light spot test induces a behavioral response in 
      C57BL/6J mice. This behavior reverts to baseline when the aversive stimulus is 
      switched off, and is blunted by treatment with the anxiolytic drug Diazepam, 
      demonstrating predictive validity of the assay, and indicating that the observed 
      behavioral response has a significant anxiety component. Also, we investigated 
      the effectiveness of the light spot test as part of sequential testing for 
      different behavioral aspects in the home-cage. Two learning tests, administered 
      prior to the light spot test, affected the light spot test parameters. The light 
      spot test is a novel, automated assay for anxiety-related high-throughput testing 
      of mice in an automated home-cage environment, allowing for both comprehensive 
      behavioral phenotyping of mice, and rapid screening of pharmacological compounds.

TI  - Copy number variant analysis from exome data in 349 patients with epileptic

AB  - Infantile spasms (IS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) are epileptic 
      encephalopathies characterized by early onset, intractable seizures, and poor 
      developmental outcomes. De novo sequence mutations and copy number variants 
      (CNVs) are causative in a subset of cases. We used exome sequence data in 349 
      trios with IS or LGS to identify putative de novo CNVs. We confirm 18 de novo 
      CNVs in 17 patients (4.8%), 10 of which are likely pathogenic, giving a firm 
      genetic diagnosis for 2.9% of patients. Confirmation of exome-predicted CNVs by 
      array-based methods is still required due to false-positive rates of prediction 
      algorithms. Our exome-based results are consistent with recent array-based 
      studies in similar cohorts and highlight novel candidate genes for IS and LGS.
