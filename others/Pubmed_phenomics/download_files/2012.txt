AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNA that plays an important role in 
      posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA. Evidence has shown that miRNA gene 
      variability might interfere with its function resulting in phenotypic variation 
      and disease susceptibility. A major role in miRNA target recognition is ascribed 
      to complementarity with the miRNA seed region that can be affected by 
      polymorphisms. In the present study, we developed an online tool for the 
      detection of miRNA polymorphisms (miRNA SNiPer) in vertebrates 
      (http://www.integratomics-time.com/miRNA-SNiPer) and generated a catalog of miRNA 
      seed region polymorphisms (miR-seed-SNPs) consisting of 149 SNPs in six species. 
      Although a majority of detected polymorphisms were due to point mutations, two 
      consecutive nucleotide substitutions (double nucleotide polymorphisms, DNPs) were 
      also identified in nine miRNAs. We determined that miR-SNPs are frequently 
      located within the quantitative trait loci (QTL), chromosome fragile sites, and 
      cancer susceptibility loci, indicating their potential role in the genetic 
      control of various complex traits. To test this further, we performed an 
      association analysis between the mmu-miR-717 seed SNP rs30372501, which is 
      polymorphic in a large number of standard inbred strains, and all phenotypic 
      traits in these strains deposited in the Mouse Phenome Database. Analysis showed 
      a significant association between the mmu-miR-717 seed SNP and a diverse array of 
      traits including behavior, blood-clinical chemistry, body weight size and growth, 
      and immune system suggesting that seed SNPs can indeed have major pleiotropic 
      effects. The bioinformatics analyses, data and tools developed in the present 
      study can serve researchers as a starting point in testing more targeted 
      hypotheses and designing experiments using optimal species or strains for further 
      mechanistic studies.

TI  - e-Photosynthesis: a comprehensive dynamic mechanistic model of C3 photosynthesis: 
      from light capture to sucrose synthesis.
PG  - 1711-27
LID - 10.1111/pce.12025 [doi]
AB  - Photosynthesis is arguably the most researched of all plant processes. A dynamic 
      model of leaf photosynthesis that includes each discrete process from light 
      capture to carbohydrate synthesis, e-photosynthesis, is described. It was 
      developed by linking and extending our previous models of photosystem II (PSII) 
      energy transfer and photosynthetic C3 carbon metabolism to include electron 
      transfer processes around photosystem I (PSI), ion transfer between the lumen and 
      stroma, ATP synthesis and NADP reduction to provide a complete representation. 
      Different regulatory processes linking the light and dark reactions are also 
      included: Rubisco activation via Rubisco activase, pH and xanthophyll 
      cycle-dependent non-photochemical quenching mechanisms, as well as the regulation 
      of enzyme activities via the ferredoxin-theoredoxin system. Although many further 
      feedback and feedforward controls undoubtedly exist, it is shown that 
      e-photosynthesis effectively mimics the typical kinetics of leaf CO₂ uptake, O₂ 
      evolution, chlorophyll fluorescence emission, lumen and stromal pH, and membrane 
      potential following perturbations in light, [CO₂] and [O₂] observed in intact C3 
      leaves. The model provides a framework for guiding engineering of improved 
      photosynthetic efficiency, for evaluating multiple non-invasive measures used in 
      emerging phenomics facilities, and for quantitative assessment of strengths and 
      weaknesses within the understanding of photosynthesis as an integrated process.

TI  - Comparative multi-omics systems analysis of Escherichia coli strains B and K-12.
PG  - R37
LID - 10.1186/gb-2012-13-5-r37 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elucidation of a genotype-phenotype relationship is critical to 
      understand an organism at the whole-system level. Here, we demonstrate that 
      comparative analyses of multi-omics data combined with a computational modeling 
      approach provide a framework for elucidating the phenotypic characteristics of 
      organisms whose genomes are sequenced. RESULTS: We present a comprehensive 
      analysis of genome-wide measurements incorporating multifaceted holistic data - 
      genome, transcriptome, proteome, and phenome - to determine the differences 
      between Escherichia coli B and K-12 strains. A genome-scale metabolic network of 
      E. coli B was reconstructed and used to identify genetic bases of the phenotypes 
      unique to B compared with K-12 through in silico complementation testing. This 
      systems analysis revealed that E. coli B is well-suited for production of 
      recombinant proteins due to a greater capacity for amino acid biosynthesis, fewer 
      proteases, and lack of flagella. Furthermore, E. coli B has an additional type II 
      secretion system and a different cell wall and outer membrane composition 
      predicted to be more favorable for protein secretion. In contrast, E. coli K-12 
      showed a higher expression of heat shock genes and was less susceptible to 
      certain stress conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This integrative systems approach 
      provides a high-resolution system-wide view and insights into why two closely 
      related strains of E. coli, B and K-12, manifest distinct phenotypes. Therefore, 
      systematic understanding of cellular physiology and metabolism of the strains is 
      essential not only to determine culture conditions but also to design recombinant 
      hosts.

AB  - Robust electronic medical records (EMR's) have made large-scale phenome-based 
      analysis feasible. The context-dependent phenome of a large ICU-based EMR 
      database (MIMIC II) was explored, as a function of a clinical feature: white 
      blood cell count (WBC). Phenome visualization led to the discovery that peak WBC 
      in the range 15-45 K/μl was highly associated with the diagnoses of Clostridium 
      difficile and bacterial sepsis; thus, it is conceivable that clinicians might 
      delay ordering targeted antimicrobials towards C. difficile for patients with 
      peak WBC in this range. This hypothesis was confirmed, with significant delays in 
      this group (median 135 vs. 85 hours, p = 0.002). These delays could be associated 
      with adverse effects on patient health and high hospitalization costs (e.g. an 
      additional $3,000,000 for the MIMIC II cohort). In conclusion, context-dependent 
      clinical reference ranges are critical to clinical decision making; furthermore, 
      important findings can be discovered through EMR-driven phenome association 
      studies.

AB  - Polymorphisms identified in genome-wide association studies of human traits 
      rarely explain more than a small proportion of the heritable variation, and 
      improving this situation within the current paradigm appears daunting. Given a 
      well-validated dynamic model of a complex physiological trait, a substantial part 
      of the underlying genetic variation must manifest as variation in model 
      parameters. These parameters are themselves phenotypic traits. By linking 
      whole-cell phenotypic variation to genetic variation in a computational model of 
      a single heart cell, incorporating genotype-to-parameter maps, we show that 
      genome-wide association studies on parameters reveal much more genetic variation 
      than when using higher-level cellular phenotypes. The results suggest that 
      letting such studies be guided by computational physiology may facilitate a 
      causal understanding of the genotype-to-phenotype map of complex traits, with 
      strong implications for the development of phenomics technology.

TI  - Ontologies as integrative tools for plant science.
PG  - 1263-75
LID - 10.3732/ajb.1200222 [doi]
AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Bio-ontologies are essential tools for accessing and 
      analyzing the rapidly growing pool of plant genomic and phenomic data. Ontologies 
      provide structured vocabularies to support consistent aggregation of data and a 
      semantic framework for automated analyses and reasoning. They are a key component 
      of the semantic web. METHODS: This paper provides background on what 
      bio-ontologies are, why they are relevant to botany, and the principles of 
      ontology development. It includes an overview of ontologies and related resources 
      that are relevant to plant science, with a detailed description of the Plant 
      Ontology (PO). We discuss the challenges of building an ontology that covers all 
      green plants (Viridiplantae). KEY RESULTS: Ontologies can advance plant science 
      in four keys areas: (1) comparative genetics, genomics, phenomics, and 
      development; (2) taxonomy and systematics; (3) semantic applications; and (4) 
      education. CONCLUSIONS: Bio-ontologies offer a flexible framework for comparative 
      plant biology, based on common botanical understanding. As genomic and phenomic 
      data become available for more species, we anticipate that the annotation of data 
      with ontology terms will become less centralized, while at the same time, the 
      need for cross-species queries will become more common, causing more researchers 
      in plant science to turn to ontologies.

TI  - Genome-wide transcriptomic variations of human lymphoblastoid cell lines: 
      insights from pairwise gene-expression correlations.
PG  - 1893-904
LID - 10.2217/pgs.12.179 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) are a rich resource of information 
      on human interindividual genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and phenomic 
      variations, and are therefore gaining popularity for pharmacogenomic studies. In 
      the present study we demonstrate that genome-wide transcriptomic data from a 
      small LCL panel from unrelated individuals is sufficient for detecting pairs of 
      genes that exhibit highly correlated expression levels and may thus convey 
      insights about coregulated genes. MATERIALS & METHODS: RNA samples were prepared 
      from LCLs representing 12 unrelated healthy adult female Caucasian donors. 
      Transcript levels were determined with the Affymetrix Human Gene arrays. 
      Expression-level correlations were searched using Partek(®) Genomics Suite™ and 
      the R environment. Sequences of detected correlated gene pairs were compared for 
      shared conserved 3´-UTR miRNA binding. RESULTS: Most of the approximately 33,000 
      transcripts covered by the Affymetrix arrays showed closely similar expression 
      levels in LCLs from unrelated donors. However, the expression levels of some 
      transcripts showed large inter-individual variations. When comparing the 
      expression levels of each of the top 1000 genes showing the largest 
      interindividual expression variations against the others, two sets containing 156 
      and 4438 correlated gene pairs with false-discovery rates of 0.01 and 0.05 were 
      detected, respectively. Similar analysis of another gene-expression data set from 
      LCLs (GSE11582) indicated that 61 and 39% of identified pairs matched the pairs 
      detected from our transcriptomic data, respectively. Shared conserved 3´-UTR 
      miRNA binding sites were noted for 14-17% of the top 100 gene pairs, suggesting 
      that regulation by miRNA may contribute to their coordinated expression. 
      CONCLUSION: Probing genome-wide transcriptomic data sets of LCLs from unrelated 
      individuals may detect coregulated genes, adding insights on cellular regulation 
      by miRNAs.

TI  - Principles of phenomics in endometriosis.
PG  - 248-59
LID - 10.1093/humupd/dms001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endometriosis has been associated with specific morphometric 
      characteristics and pigmentary traits. The purpose of this study was to 
      systematically review prior publications dealing with this aspect in order to 
      revisit phenotypic information in the context of phenomics principles. METHODS: 
      Comprehensive searches of Pubmed, Medline and Embase were conducted to identify 
      studies, published from 1990 to 2011 in the English language literature, on the 
      relationship between endometriosis and morphometric characteristics/pigmentary 
      traits. RESULTS: We identified 11 studies on the association between 
      endometriosis and body mass index (BMI) in the adult population and 5 studies on 
      the same association during early life. While a modest inverse correlation was 
      found between endometriosis and adult BMI, a stronger association was 
      consistently demonstrated between endometriosis and early life body size, even 
      after adjusting for confounding factors such as age, birthweight, age at 
      menarche, parity and oral contraceptive use. Four papers have been published on 
      the association between endometriosis and cutaneous naevi and five on the 
      association between the disease and specific pigmentary traits. A skin phenotype 
      characterized by the presence of naevi and freckles and by a high sensitivity to 
      sun exposure is represented more frequently in women with endometriosis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Endometriosis appears to be associated with some phenotypic 
      variations likely attributable to the strong effect of the environment on the 
      expression and function of genes influencing the traits. Novel clues on 
      endometriosis pathogenesis may derive from the analysis of the phenotypic traits 
      associated with the disease.

AB  - During many biological experiments voluminous data is acquired, which can be best 
      collected with -portable data acquisition devices and later analyzed with a 
      personal computer (PC). Public domain software catering to data acquisition and 
      analysis is currently limited. The necessity of phenotyping large plant 
      populations led to the development of the application "PHENOME" to manage the 
      data. PHENOME allows acquisition of phenotypic data using a personal digital 
      assistant (PDA) with a built-in barcode scanner. The acquired data can be 
      exported to a customized database on a PC for further analysis and cataloging. 
      PHENOME can be used for a variety of applications, for example high-throughput 
      phenotyping of a mutagenized or mapping population, or phenotyping of several 
      individuals in one or more ecological niches.

TI  - Phenotyping for drought tolerance of crops in the genomics era.
PG  - 347
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2012.00347 [doi]
LID - 347
AB  - Improving crops yield under water-limited conditions is the most daunting 
      challenge faced by breeders. To this end, accurate, relevant phenotyping plays an 
      increasingly pivotal role for the selection of drought-resilient genotypes and, 
      more in general, for a meaningful dissection of the quantitative genetic 
      landscape that underscores the adaptive response of crops to drought. A major and 
      universally recognized obstacle to a more effective translation of the results 
      produced by drought-related studies into improved cultivars is the difficulty in 
      properly phenotyping in a high-throughput fashion in order to identify the 
      quantitative trait loci that govern yield and related traits across different 
      water regimes. This review provides basic principles and a broad set of 
      references useful for the management of phenotyping practices for the study and 
      genetic dissection of drought tolerance and, ultimately, for the release of 
      drought-tolerant cultivars.

TI  - Molecular breeding for the development of multiple disease resistance in Basmati 
      rice.
PG  - pls029
LID - 10.1093/aobpla/pls029 [doi]
LID - pls029
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Basmati rice grown in the Indian subcontinent is highly 
      valued for its unique culinary qualities. Production is, however, often 
      constrained by diseases such as bacterial blight (BB), blast and sheath blight 
      (ShB). The present study developed Basmati rice with inbuilt resistance to BB, 
      blast and ShB using molecular marker-assisted selection. METHODOLOGY: The rice 
      cultivar 'Improved Pusa Basmati 1' (carrying the BB resistance genes xa13 and 
      Xa21) was used as the recurrent parent and cultivar 'Tetep' (carrying the blast 
      resistance gene Pi54 and ShB resistance quality trait loci (QTL), qSBR11-1) was 
      the donor. Marker-assisted foreground selection was employed to identify plants 
      possessing resistance alleles in the segregating generations along with stringent 
      phenotypic selection for faster recovery of the recurrent parent genome (RPG) and 
      phenome (RPP). Background analysis with molecular markers was used to estimate 
      the recovery of RPG in improved lines. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Foreground selection 
      coupled with stringent phenotypic selection identified plants homozygous for 
      xa13, Xa21 and Pi54, which were advanced to BC(2)F(5) through pedigree selection. 
      Marker-assisted selection for qSBR11-1 in BC(2)F(5) using flanking markers 
      identified seven homozygous families. Background analysis revealed that RPG 
      recovery was up to 89.5%. Screening with highly virulent isolates of BB, blast 
      and ShB showed that the improved lines were resistant to all three diseases and 
      were on a par with 'Improved Pusa Basmati 1' for yield, duration and Basmati 
      grain quality. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of marker-assisted transfer 
      of genes conferring resistance to three different diseases in rice wherein genes 
      xa13 and Xa21 for BB resistance, Pi54 for blast resistance, and a major QTL 
      qSBR11-1 have been combined through marker-assisted backcross breeding. In 
      addition to offering the potential for release as cultivars, the pyramided lines 
      will serve as useful donors of gene(s) for BB, blast and ShB in future Basmati 
      rice breeding programmes.

TI  - Merging genomic and phenomic data for research and clinical impact.
PG  - 111-5
AB  - Driven primarily by advances in genomics, pharmacogenomics and systems biology 
      technologies, large amounts of genomic and phenomic data are today being 
      collected on individuals worldwide. Integrative analysis, mining, and computer 
      modeling of these data, facilitated by information technology, have led to the 
      development of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine. This 
      transformative approach holds the potential inter alia to enable future general 
      practitioners and physicians to prescribe the right drug to the right patient at 
      the right dosage. For such patient-specific medicine to be adopted as standard 
      clinical practice, publicly accumulated knowledge of genes, proteins, molecular 
      functional annotations, and interactions need to be unified and with electronic 
      health records including phenotypic information, most of which still reside as 
      paper-based records in hospitals. We review the state-of-the-art in terms of 
      electronic data capture and medical data standards. Some of these activities are 
      drawn from research projects currently being performed within the European 
      Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) initiative; all are being monitored by the VPH 
      INBIOMEDvision Consortium. Various ethical, legal and societal issues linked with 
      privacy will increasingly arise in the post-genomic era. This will require a 
      closer interaction between the bioinformatics/systems biology and medical 
      informatics/healthcare communities. Planning for how individuals will own their 
      personal health records is urgently needed, as the cost of sequencing a whole 
      human genome will soon be less than U.S. $100. We discuss some of the issues that 
      will need to be addressed by society as a result of this revolution in 
      healthcare.

AB  - Teeth are a good system for studying development and evolution. Tooth development 
      is largely independent of the rest of the body and teeth can be grown in culture 
      to attain almost normal morphology. Their development is not affected by the 
      patterns of movement or sensorial perception in the embryo. Teeth are hard and 
      easily preserved. Thus, there is plenty of easily accessible information about 
      the patterns of morphological variation occurring between and within species. 
      This review summarises recent work and describes how tooth development can be 
      understood as the coupling between a reaction-diffusion system and differential 
      growth produced by diffusible growth factors: which growth factors are involved, 
      how they affect each other's expression and how they affect the spatial patterns 
      of proliferation that lead to final morphology. There are some aspects of tooth 
      development, however, that do not conform to some common assumptions in many 
      reaction-diffusion models. Those are discussed here since they provide clues 
      about how reaction-diffusion systems may work in actual developmental systems. 
      Mathematical models implementing what we know about tooth development are 
      discussed.

TI  - Candidate genes in ocular dominance plasticity.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2012.00011 [doi]
LID - 11
AB  - Many studies have been devoted to the identification of genes involved in 
      experience-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex. To discover new candidate 
      genes, we have reexamined data from one such study on ocular dominance (OD) 
      plasticity in recombinant inbred BXD mouse strains. We have correlated the level 
      of plasticity with the gene expression data in the neocortex that have become 
      available for these same strains. We propose that genes with a high correlation 
      are likely to play a role in OD plasticity. We have tested this hypothesis for 
      genes whose inactivation is known to affect OD plasticity. The expression levels 
      of these genes indeed correlated with OD plasticity if their levels showed strong 
      differences between the BXD strains. To narrow down our candidate list of 
      correlated genes, we have selected only those genes that were previously found to 
      be regulated by visual experience and associated with pathways implicated in OD 
      plasticity. This resulted in a list of 32 candidate genes. The list contained 
      unproven, but not unexpected candidates such as the genes for IGF-1, NCAM1, 
      NOGO-A, the gamma2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor, acetylcholine esterase, and 
      the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. This demonstrates the 
      viability of our approach. More interestingly, the following novel candidate 
      genes were identified: Akap7, Akt1, Camk2d, Cckbr, Cd44, Crim1, Ctdsp2, Dnajc5, 
      Gnai1, Itpka, Mapk8, Nbea, Nfatc3, Nlk, Npy5r, Phf21a, Phip, Ppm1l, Ppp1r1b, 
      Rbbp4, Slc1a3, Slit2, Socs2, Spock3, St8sia1, Zfp207. Whether all these novel 
      candidates indeed function in OD plasticity remains to be established, but 
      possible roles of some of them are discussed in the article.

TI  - Phenomics of rice early vigour and drought response: Are sugar related and 
      morphogenetic traits relevant?
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/1939-8433-5-22 [doi]
LID - 22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early vigour (biomass accumulation) is a useful but complex trait in 
      rainfed rice (Oryza sativa L). Little is known on trade-offs with drought 
      tolerance. This study explored the relevance of (sugar) metabolic and 
      morphogenetic traits to describe the genetic diversity of rice early vigour and 
      its phenotypic plasticity under drought conditions. A greenhouse experiment was 
      conducted to characterize on a panel of 43 rice genotypes plant morphogenesis and 
      sugar concentration in expanded (source) and expanding (sink) leaves. RESULTS: 
      Across genotypes in control treatment, leaf starch concentration was negatively 
      correlated with organogenetic development rate (DR, defined as leaf appearance 
      rate on main stem). Genotypes with small leaves had high DR and tiller number but 
      low leaf starch concentration. Under drought, vigorous genotypes showed stronger 
      growth reduction. Starch concentration decreased in source leaves, by contrast 
      with soluble sugars and with that observed in sink leaves. Accordingly, genotypes 
      were grouped in three clusters differing in constitutive vigour, starch storage 
      and growth maintenance under drought showing a trade off between constitutive 
      vigour and drought tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: It was therefore suggested that non 
      structural carbohydrates, particularly starch, were relevant markers of early 
      vigour. Their relevance as markers of growth maintenance under drought needs to 
      be further explored. Results are discussed regarding novel process based traits 
      to be introduced in the GRiSP (Global Rice Science Partnership) phenotyping 
      network.

TI  - A simulation study to assess a variable selection method for selecting single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms associated with disease.
PG  - 1151-61
LID - 10.1089/cmb.2011.0105 [doi]
AB  - In genome-wide association studies, where hundreds of thousands of single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are genotyped, the potential for false positives 
      is high and methods for selecting models with only a few SNPs are required. 
      Methods for variable selection giving sets of SNPs associated with disease have 
      been developed, but are still less common than evaluation of individual SNPs one 
      at a time. To assess the potential improvement available from multi-SNP 
      approaches, we examined the performance of the software GeneRaVE as a variable 
      selection method when applied to SNP data in case-control studies. The method was 
      assessed via simulations, in which a haplotype identified by three SNPs was taken 
      to be associated with the disease. Simulated data sets reflecting different 
      levels and patterns of genetic association with the disease were generated. In 
      order to have a baseline level of performance to assess the method against, we 
      used a generalized linear model using only the three disease susceptibility SNPs 
      to provide an upper bound on the possible performance of the selection methods. 
      To investigate the advantage of using variable selection method as a multivariate 
      method over a single SNP approach, we used chi-squared tests for each of the 
      disease susceptibility (DS) SNPs with correction for multiple testing. Simulation 
      results showed that GeneRaVE performed well and outperformed single SNP analysis 
      using the chi-squared method in identifying disease-related SNPs. In application 
      to a large dataset, it identified SNPs known to be associated with disease that 
      were not identified by single SNP methods.

TI  - Where genome meets phenome: rationale for integrating genetic and protein 
      biomarkers in the diagnosis and management of dilated cardiomyopathy and heart 
      failure.
PG  - 283-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jacc.2012.05.005 [doi]
AB  - This review provides the rationale for integrating genomic and protein biomarkers 
      in the evolving diagnosis and management of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and its 
      causal pathway to heart failure (HF), with a larger objective to serve as a 
      template for genomic and phenomic profiling of other cardiovascular disease. DCM 
      is a major cause of HF and accounts for more than half of heart transplantation 
      in adults and children worldwide. DCM may remain asymptomatic for years, but HF 
      and/or arrhythmias, both late manifestations of the disease, ultimately cause 
      significant morbidity and mortality. A significant proportion of DCM has a 
      genetic etiology. DCM can also result from environmental injury such as 
      infection, toxins, or catecholamine excess. While molecular genetic testing can 
      identify those at risk for genetic DCM, epigenetic and sentinel phenomic staging 
      can help to identify those at highest risk in need for intervention. Phenomic 
      staging includes integrating clinical and imaging features, transcriptomics, 
      higher order proteomics and metabolomics interactions, and epidemiological data. 
      This principle can be applied in family members of patients with DCM, where 
      genetic testing and clinical phenotyping are indicated. This will allow the 
      design of specific interventions tailored to individuals sharing similar risks, 
      to alter the natural history of DCM and obviate complications such as 
      HF/arrhythmias.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) can be used to investigate 
      the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a wide 
      spectrum of phenotypes. This is a complementary approach to Genome Wide 
      Association studies (GWAS) that calculate the association between hundreds of 
      thousands of SNPs and one or a limited range of phenotypes. The extensive 
      exploration of the association between phenotypic structure and genotypic 
      variation through PheWAS produces a set of complex and comprehensive results. 
      Integral to fully inspecting, analysing, and interpreting PheWAS results is 
      visualization of the data. RESULTS: We have developed the software PheWAS-View 
      for visually integrating PheWAS results, including information about the SNPs, 
      relevant genes, phenotypes, and the interrelationships between phenotypes, that 
      exist in PheWAS. As a result both the fine grain detail as well as the larger 
      trends that exist within PheWAS results can be elucidated. CONCLUSIONS: PheWAS 
      can be used to discover novel relationships between SNPs, phenotypes, and 
      networks of interrelated phenotypes; identify pleiotropy; provide novel 
      mechanistic insights; and foster hypothesis generation - and these results can be 
      both explored and presented with PheWAS-View. PheWAS-View is freely available for 
      non-commercial research institutions, for full details see

TI  - Mining the human phenome using semantic web technologies: a case study for Type 2 
      Diabetes.
PG  - 699-708
AB  - The ability to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has enabled new 
      exploration of how genetic variations contribute to health and disease etiology. 
      However, historically GWAS have been limited by inadequate sample size due to 
      associated costs for genotyping and phenotyping of study subjects. This has 
      prompted several academic medical centers to form "biobanks" where biospecimens 
      linked to personal health information, typically in electronic health records 
      (EHRs), are collected and stored on large number of subjects. This provides 
      tremendous opportunities to discover novel genotype-phenotype associations and 
      foster hypothesis generation. In this work, we study how emerging Semantic Web 
      technologies can be applied in conjunction with clinical and genotype data stored 
      at the Mayo Clinic Biobank to mine the phenotype data for genetic associations. 
      In particular, we demonstrate the role of using Resource Description Framework 
      (RDF) for representing EHR diagnoses and procedure data, and enable federated 
      querying via standardized Web protocols to identify subjects genotyped with Type 
      2 Diabetes for discovering gene-disease associations. Our study highlights the 
      potential of Web-scale data federation techniques to execute complex queries.

TI  - Applying semantic web technologies for phenome-wide scan using an electronic 
      health record linked Biobank.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has 
      enabled new exploration of how genetic variations contribute to health and 
      disease etiology. However, historically GWAS have been limited by inadequate 
      sample size due to associated costs for genotyping and phenotyping of study 
      subjects. This has prompted several academic medical centers to form "biobanks" 
      where biospecimens linked to personal health information, typically in electronic 
      health records (EHRs), are collected and stored on a large number of subjects. 
      This provides tremendous opportunities to discover novel genotype-phenotype 
      associations and foster hypotheses generation. RESULTS: In this work, we study 
      how emerging Semantic Web technologies can be applied in conjunction with 
      clinical and genotype data stored at the Mayo Clinic Biobank to mine the 
      phenotype data for genetic associations. In particular, we demonstrate the role 
      of using Resource Description Framework (RDF) for representing EHR diagnoses and 
      procedure data, and enable federated querying via standardized Web protocols to 
      identify subjects genotyped for Type 2 Diabetes and Hypothyroidism to discover 
      gene-disease associations. Our study highlights the potential of Web-scale data 
      federation techniques to execute complex queries. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrates how Semantic Web technologies can be applied in conjunction with 
      clinical data stored in EHRs to accurately identify subjects with specific 
      diseases and phenotypes, and identify genotype-phenotype associations.

TI  - A novel mesh processing based technique for 3D plant analysis.
PG  - 63
LID - 10.1186/1471-2229-12-63 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, imaging based, automated, non-invasive, and 
      non-destructive high-throughput plant phenotyping platforms have become popular 
      tools for plant biology, underpinning the field of plant phenomics. Such 
      platforms acquire and record large amounts of raw data that must be accurately 
      and robustly calibrated, reconstructed, and analysed, requiring the development 
      of sophisticated image understanding and quantification algorithms. The raw data 
      can be processed in different ways, and the past few years have seen the 
      emergence of two main approaches: 2D image processing and 3D mesh processing 
      algorithms. Direct image quantification methods (usually 2D) dominate the current 
      literature due to comparative simplicity. However, 3D mesh analysis provides the 
      tremendous potential to accurately estimate specific morphological features 
      cross-sectionally and monitor them over-time. RESULT: In this paper, we present a 
      novel 3D mesh based technique developed for temporal high-throughput plant 
      phenomics and perform initial tests for the analysis of Gossypium hirsutum 
      vegetative growth. Based on plant meshes previously reconstructed from multi-view 
      images, the methodology involves several stages, including morphological mesh 
      segmentation, phenotypic parameters estimation, and plant organs tracking over 
      time. The initial study focuses on presenting and validating the accuracy of the 
      methodology on dicotyledons such as cotton but we believe the approach will be 
      more broadly applicable. This study involved applying our technique to a set of 
      six Gossypium hirsutum (cotton) plants studied over four time-points. Manual 
      measurements, performed for each plant at every time-point, were used to assess 
      the accuracy of our pipeline and quantify the error on the morphological 
      parameters estimated. CONCLUSION: By directly comparing our automated mesh based 
      quantitative data with manual measurements of individual stem height, leaf width 
      and leaf length, we obtained the mean absolute errors of 9.34%, 5.75%, 8.78%, and 
      correlation coefficients 0.88, 0.96, and 0.95 respectively. The temporal matching 
      of leaves was accurate in 95% of the cases and the average execution time 
      required to analyse a plant over four time-points was 4.9 minutes. The mesh 
      processing based methodology is thus considered suitable for quantitative 4D 
      monitoring of plant phenotypic features.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder estimated to 
      affect 1 in 110 children in the U.S., yet the pathology of this disorder is not 
      fully understood. Abnormal levels of several growth factors have been 
      demonstrated in adults with ASD, including epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 
      hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Both of these growth factors serve important 
      roles in neurodevelopment and immune function. In this study, concentrations of 
      EGF and HGF were assessed in the plasma of 49 children with ASD aged 2-4 years 
      old and 31 typically developing controls of a similar age as part of the Autism 
      Phenome Project (APP). Levels of EGF were significantly reduced in the ASD group 
      compared to typically developing controls (P = 0.003). There were no significant 
      differences in HGF levels in young children with ASD and typically developing 
      controls. EGF plays an important role in regulating neural growth, proliferation, 
      differentiation and migration, and reduced levels of this molecule may negatively 
      impact neurodevelopment in young children with ASD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the etiopathology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is not 
      clear, there is increasing evidence that dysfunction in the immune system affects 
      many children with ASD. Findings of immune dysfunction in ASD include increases 
      in inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and microglial activity in brain tissue 
      and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as abnormal peripheral immune cell function. 
      METHODS: Adhesion molecules, such as platelet endothelial adhesion molecule-1 
      (PECAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion 
      molecule-1 (VCAM-1), P-selectin, and L-selectin, function to facilitate leukocyte 
      transendothelial migration. We assessed concentrations of soluble adhesion 
      molecules, sPECAM-1, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, sP-selectin, and sL-selectin in the plasma 
      of 49 participants with ASD and 31 typically developing controls of the same age, 
      all of whom were enrolled as part of the Autism Phenome Project. Behavioral 
      assessment, the levels of soluble adhesion molecules, and head circumference were 
      compared in the same subjects. RESULTS: Levels of sPECAM-1 and sP-selectin were 
      significantly reduced in the ASD group compared to typically developing controls 
      (p < .02). Soluble PECAM-1 levels were negatively associated with repetitive 
      behavior and abnormal brain growth in children with ASD (p = .03). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Because adhesion molecules modulate the permeability and signaling at the 
      blood-brain barrier as well as leukocyte infiltration into the central nervous 
      system, the current data suggest a role for these molecules in the complex 
      pathophysiology of ASD.

AB  - The genotype-phenotype relation is at the core of theoretical biology. It is 
      argued why a mathematically based explanatory structure of this relation is in 
      principle possible, and why it has to embrace both sequence to consequence and 
      consequence to sequence phenomena. It is suggested that the primary role of DNA 
      in the chain of causality is that its presence allows a living system to induce 
      perturbations of its own dynamics as a function of its own system state or 
      phenome, i.e. it capacitates living systems to self-transcend beyond those 
      morphogenetic limits that exist for non-living open physical systems in general. 
      Dynamic models bridging genotypes with phenotypic variation in a causally 
      cohesive way are shown to provide explanations of genetic phenomena that go well 
      beyond the explanatory domains of statistically oriented genetics theory 
      construction. A theory originally proposed by Rupert Riedl, which implies that 
      the morphospace that is reachable by the standing genetic variation in a 
      population is quite restricted due to systemic constraints, is shown to provide a 
      foundation for a mathematical conceptualization of numerous evolutionary 
      phenomena associated with the phenotypic consequence to sequence relation. The 
      paper may be considered a call to arms to mathematicians and the mathematically 
      inclined to rise to the challenge of developing new formalisms capable of dealing 
      with the deep defining characteristics of living systems.

AB  - Researchers use animal studies to better understand human diseases. In recent 
      years, large-scale phenotype studies such as Phenoscape and EuroPhenome have been 
      initiated to identify genetic causes of a species' phenome. Species-specific 
      phenotype ontologies are required to capture and report about all findings and to 
      automatically infer results relevant to human diseases. The integration of the 
      different phenotype ontologies into a coherent framework is necessary to achieve 
      interoperability for cross-species research.Here, we investigate the quality and 
      completeness of two different methods to align the Human Phenotype Ontology and 
      the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology. The first method combines lexical matching with 
      inference over the ontologies' taxonomic structures, while the second method uses 
      a mapping algorithm based on the formal definitions of the ontologies. Neither 
      method could map all concepts. Despite the formal definitions method provides 
      mappings for more concepts than does the lexical matching method, it does not 
      outperform the lexical matching in a biological use case. Our results suggest 
      that combining both approaches will yield a better mappings in terms of 
      completeness, specificity and application purposes.

AB  - Environmental stress played a major role in the evolution of the blind mole rat 
      superspecies Spalax ehrenbergi, affecting its adaptive evolution and ecological 
      speciation underground. Spalax is safeguarded all of its life underground from 
      aboveground climatic fluctuations and predators. However, it encounters multiple 
      stresses in its underground burrows including darkness, energetics, hypoxia, 
      hypercapnia, food scarcity, and pathogenicity. Consequently, it evolved adaptive 
      genomic, proteomic, and phenomic complexes to cope with those stresses. Here I 
      describe some of these adaptive complexes, and their theoretical and applied 
      perspectives. Spalax mosaic molecular and organismal evolution involves 
      reductions or regressions coupled with expansions or progressions caused by 
      evolutionary tinkering and natural genetic engineering. Speciation of Spalax in 
      Israel occurred in the Pleistocene, during the last 2.00-2.35 Mya, generating 
      four species associated intimately with four climatic regimes with increasing 
      aridity stress southwards and eastwards representing an ecological speciational 
      adaptive trend: (Spalax golani, 2n=54→S. galili, 2n=52→S. carmeli, 2n=58→S. 
      judaei, 2n=60). Darwinian ecological speciation occurred gradually with 
      relatively little genetic change by Robertsonian chromosomal and genic mutations. 
      Spalax genome sequencing has just been completed. It involves multiple adaptive 
      complexes to life underground and is an evolutionary model to a few hundred 
      underground mammals. It involves great promise in the future for medicine, space 
      flight, and deep-sea diving.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP) is a large-scale, 
      multi-institutional, collaborative network of 27 epilepsy centers throughout the 
      U.S., Australia, and Argentina, with the objective of collecting detailed 
      phenotypic and genetic data on a large number of epilepsy participants. The goals 
      of EPGP are (1) to perform detailed phenotyping on 3750 participants with 
      specific forms of non-acquired epilepsy and 1500 parents without epilepsy, (2) to 
      obtain DNA samples on these individuals, and (3) to ultimately genotype the 
      samples in order to discover novel genes that cause epilepsy. To carry out the 
      project, a reliable and robust informatics platform was needed for standardized 
      electronic data collection and storage, data quality review, and phenotypic 
      analysis involving cases from multiple sites. METHODS: EPGP developed its own 
      suite of web-based informatics applications for participant tracking, electronic 
      data collection (using electronic case report forms/surveys), data management, 
      phenotypic data review and validation, specimen tracking, electroencephalograph 
      and neuroimaging storage, and issue tracking. We implemented procedures to train 
      and support end-users at each clinical site. RESULTS: Thus far, 3780 study 
      participants have been enrolled and 20,957 web-based study activities have been 
      completed using this informatics platform. Over 95% of respondents to an end-user 
      satisfaction survey felt that the informatics platform was successful almost 
      always or most of the time. CONCLUSIONS: The EPGP informatics platform has 
      successfully and effectively allowed study management and efficient and reliable 
      collection of phenotypic data. Our novel informatics platform met the 
      requirements of a large, multicenter research project. The platform has had a 
      high level of end-user acceptance by principal investigators and study 
      coordinators, and can serve as a model for new tools to support future large 
      scale, collaborative research projects collecting extensive phenotypic data.

TI  - [Global understanding of pain].
PG  - 63-72
AB  - Clinically, it is well-known that chronic pain induces depression, anxiety, and 
      reduced quality of life. Neuropathic pain, which is characterized by spontaneous 
      burning pain, hyperalgesia and allodynia, is the most difficult pain to manage in 
      the pain clinic. However, the complicated pathophysiology of neuropathic pain is 
      not yet understood. A better understanding of its pathophysiology has given us 
      more insight into its various mechanisms and possible treatment options. This 
      review will explore the most current issues in the field of pain, with a focus on 
      transcriptional research, epigenetic research and post-transcriptional research. 
      For a global understanding of the pain, it is necessary to analyze the 
      correlation between these temporal parameters and phenomics.

TI  - A novel QTL underlying early-onset, low-frequency hearing loss in BXD recombinant 
      inbred strains.

AB  - The DBA/2J inbred strain of mice has been used extensively in hearing research as 
      it suffers from early-onset, progressive hearing loss. Initially, it mostly 
      affects high frequencies, but already at 2-3 months hearing loss becomes broad. 
      In search for hearing loss genes other than Cadherin 23 (otocadherin) and 
      fascin-2, which make a large contribution to the high-frequency deficits, we used 
      a large set of the genetic reference population of BXD recombinant inbred 
      strains. For frequencies 4, 8, 16 and 32 kHz, auditory brainstem response hearing 
      thresholds were longitudinally determined from 2-3 up to 12 weeks of age. Apart 
      from a significant, broad quantitative trait locus (QTL) for high-frequency 
      hearing loss on chromosome 11 containing the fascin-2 gene, we found a novel, 
      small QTL for low-frequency hearing loss on chromosome 18, from hereon called 
      ahl9. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction of organs of Corti, 
      isolated from a subset of strains, showed that a limited number of genes at the 
      QTL were expressed in the organ of Corti. Of those genes, several showed 
      significant expression differences based on the parental line contributing to the 
      allele. Our results may aid in the future identification of genes involved in 
      low-frequency, early-onset hearing loss.

AB  - With the advent of transgenic technology, it has become possible to mobilize and 
      express foreign genes into plants and to design crop varieties with better 
      agronomic attributes and adaptability to challenging environmental conditions. 
      Recent advances in transgenic technology have led to concerns about safety of 
      transgenic crops to human and animal health and environment. Biosafety focuses on 
      preventing, minimizing and eliminating risks associated with the research, 
      production, and use of transgenic crops. Food biosafety involves studies of 
      substantial equivalence related to compositional analysis, toxicity and 
      allergenicity. Environmental biosafety involves glasshouse and field trials and 
      study of unintended effects on non-target organisms. Transgenics are 
      characterized at phenotypic and molecular levels for understanding the location 
      of transgene insertion site, ploidy level, copy number, integrated vector 
      sequences, protein expression and stability of the transgene. Various techniques 
      employed for transgene characterization include flow cytometry, southern, 
      northern and western analyses, real-time (qRT) PCR, competitive PCR, FISH, 
      fiber-FISH, DNA micro-arrays, mRNA profiling, 2DE-MS, iTRAQ, FT-MS, NMR, GC-MS, 
      CE-MS and biosensor-based approaches. Evaluation of transgene expression involves 
      the application of integrated phenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and 
      metabolomics approaches. However, the relevance and application of these 
      approaches may vary in different cases. The elaborate analysis of transgenic 
      crops will facilitate the safety assessment and commercialization of transgenics 
      and lead to global food security for the future.

TI  - From ecophysiology to phenomics: some implications of photoprotection and 
      shade-sun acclimation in situ for dynamics of thylakoids in vitro.
PG  - 3503-14
LID - 10.1098/rstb.2012.0072 [doi]
AB  - Half a century of research into the physiology and biochemistry of sun-shade 
      acclimation in diverse plants has provided reality checks for contemporary 
      understanding of thylakoid membrane dynamics. This paper reviews recent insights 
      into photosynthetic efficiency and photoprotection from studies of two 
      xanthophyll cycles in old shade leaves from the inner canopy of the tropical 
      trees Inga sapindoides and Persea americana (avocado). It then presents new 
      physiological data from avocado on the time frames of the slow coordinated 
      photosynthetic development of sink leaves in sunlight and on the slow renovation 
      of photosynthetic properties in old leaves during sun to shade and shade to sun 
      acclimation. In so doing, it grapples with issues in vivo that seem relevant to 
      our increasingly sophisticated understanding of ΔpH-dependent, 
      xanthophyll-pigment-stabilized non-photochemical quenching in the antenna of PSII 
      in thylakoid membranes in vitro.

TI  - High-throughput phenotyping of avoidance learning in mice discriminates different 
      genotypes and identifies a novel gene.
PG  - 772-84

AB  - Recognizing and avoiding aversive situations are central aspects of mammalian 
      cognition. These abilities are essential for health and survival and are expected 
      to have a prominent genetic basis. We modeled these abilities in eight common 
      mouse inbred strains covering ∼75% of the species' natural variation and in 
      gene-trap mice (>2000 mice), using an unsupervised, automated assay with an 
      instrumented home cage (PhenoTyper) containing a shelter with two entrances. Mice 
      visited this shelter for 20-1200 times/24 h and 71% of all mice developed a 
      significant and often strong preference for one entrance. Subsequently, a mild 
      aversive stimulus (shelter illumination) was automatically delivered when mice 
      used their preferred entrance. Different genotypes developed different coping 
      strategies. Firstly, the number of entries via the preferred entrance decreased 
      in DBA/2J, C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ, indicating that these genotypes associated 
      one specific entrance with the aversive stimulus. Secondly, mice started sleeping 
      outside (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J), indicating they associated the shelter, in general, 
      with the aversive stimulus. Some mice showed no evidence for an association 
      between the entrance and the aversive light, but did show markedly shorter 
      shelter residence times in response to illumination, indicating they did perceive 
      illumination as aversive. Finally, using this assay, we screened 43 different 
      mutants, which yielded a novel gene, specc1/cytospinB. This mutant showed 
      profound and specific delay in avoidance learning. Together, these data suggest 
      that different genotypes express distinct learning and/or memory of associations 
      between shelter entrance and aversive stimuli, and that specc1/cytospinB is 
      involved in this aspect of cognition.

AB  - The Mouse Phenome Project was launched a decade ago to complement mouse genome 
      sequencing efforts by promoting new phenotyping initiatives under standardized 
      conditions and collecting the data in a central public database, the Mouse 
      Phenome Database (MPD; http://phenome.jax.org). MPD houses a wealth of strain 
      characteristics data to facilitate the use of the laboratory mouse in 
      translational research for human health and disease, helping alleviate problems 
      involving experimentation in humans that cannot be done practically or ethically. 
      Data sets are voluntarily contributed by researchers from a variety of 
      institutions and settings, or in some cases, retrieved by MPD staff from public 
      sources. MPD maintains a growing collection of standardized reference data that 
      assists investigators in selecting mouse strains for research applications; 
      houses treatment/control data for drug studies and other interventions; offers a 
      standardized platform for discovering genotype-phenotype relationships; and 
      provides tools for hypothesis testing. MPD improvements and updates since our 
      last NAR report are presented, including the addition of new tools and features 
      to facilitate navigation and data mining as well as the acquisition of new data 
      (phenotypic, genotypic and gene expression).

TI  - New roots for agriculture: exploiting the root phenome.
PG  - 1598-604
LID - 10.1098/rstb.2011.0243 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in root biology are making it possible to genetically design root 
      systems with enhanced soil exploration and resource capture. These cultivars 
      would have substantial value for improving food security in developing nations, 
      where yields are limited by drought and low soil fertility, and would enhance the 
      sustainability of intensive agriculture. Many of the phenes controlling soil 
      resource capture are related to root architecture. We propose that a better 
      understanding of the root phenome is needed to effectively translate genetic 
      advances into improved crop cultivars. Elementary, unique root phenes need to be 
      identified. We need to understand the 'fitness landscape' for these phenes: how 
      they affect crop performance in an array of environments and phenotypes. Finally, 
      we need to develop methods to measure phene expression rapidly and economically 
      without artefacts. These challenges, especially mapping the fitness landscape, 
      are non-trivial, and may warrant new research and training modalities.

TI  - A yeast phenomic model for the gene interaction network modulating CFTR-ΔF508 
      protein biogenesis.
PG  - 103
LID - 10.1186/gm404 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The overall influence of gene interaction in human disease is 
      unknown. In cystic fibrosis (CF) a single allele of the cystic fibrosis 
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR-[increment]F508) accounts for most of 
      the disease. In cell models, CFTR-[increment]F508 exhibits defective protein 
      biogenesis and degradation rather than proper trafficking to the plasma membrane 
      where CFTR normally functions. Numerous genes function in the biogenesis of CFTR 
      and influence the fate of CFTR-[increment]F508. However it is not known whether 
      genetic variation in such genes contributes to disease severity in patients. Nor 
      is there an easy way to study how numerous gene interactions involving 
      CFTR-[increment]F would manifest phenotypically. METHODS: To gain insight into 
      the function and evolutionary conservation of a gene interaction network that 
      regulates biogenesis of a misfolded ABC-transporter, we employed yeast genetics 
      to develop a "phenomic" model, in which the CFTR-[increment]F508-equivalent 
      residue of a yeast homolog is mutated (Yor1-[increment]F670), and where the 
      genome is scanned quantitatively for interaction. We first confirmed that 
      Yor1-[increment]F undergoes protein misfolding and has reduced half-life, 
      analogous to CFTR-[increment]F. Gene interaction was then assessed quantitatively 
      by growth curves for all ~5000 double mutants, based on alteration in the dose 
      response to growth inhibition by oligomycin, a toxin extruded from the cell at 
      the plasma membrane by Yor1. RESULTS: From a comparative genomic perspective, 
      yeast gene interaction influencing Yor1-[increment]F biogenesis was 
      representative of human homologs previously found to modulate processing of 
      CFTR-[increment]F in mammalian cells. Additional evolutionarily conserved 
      pathways were implicated by the study, and a [increment]F-specific pro-biogenesis 
      function of the recently discovered ER Membrane Complex (EMC) was evident from 
      the yeast screen. This novel function was validated biochemically by siRNA of an 
      EMC ortholog in a human cell line expressing CFTR-[increment]F508. The precision 
      and accuracy of quantitative high throughput cell array phenotyping (Q-HTCP), 
      which captures tens of thousands of growth curves simultaneously, provided 
      powerful resolution to measure gene interaction on a phenomic scale, based on 
      discrete cell proliferation parameters. CONCLUSION: We propose phenomic analysis 
      of Yor1-[increment]F as a model for investigating gene interaction networks that 
      can modulate cystic fibrosis disease severity. Although the clinical relevance of 
      the Yor1-[increment]F gene interaction network for cystic fibrosis remains to be 
      defined, the model appears to be informative with respect to human cell models of 
      CFTR-[increment]F. Moreover, the general strategy of yeast phenomics can be 
      employed in a systematic manner to model gene interaction for other diseases 
      relating to pathologies that result from protein misfolding or potentially any 
      disease involving evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways.

TI  - Independent genetic loci for sensorimotor gating and attentional performance in 
      BXD recombinant inbred strains.
PG  - 147-56
LID - 10.1111/j.1601-183X.2011.00754.x [doi]
AB  - A startle reflex in response to an intense acoustic stimulus is inhibited when a 
      barely detectable pulse precedes the startle stimulus by 30-500 ms. It has been 
      theorized that this phenomenon, named prepulse inhibition (PPI) of a startle 
      response, is an automatic early-stage gating process contributing to the ability 
      to focus attention. Deficits in PPI may therefore contribute to deficits in 
      attentional processing. Both deficits are observed in schizophrenia spectrum 
      disorders. Here, we investigated whether there is overlap in genetic control of 
      PPI and attentional processing phenotypes in the panel of BXD recombinant inbred 
      strains of mice. Using an individually titrated prepulse intensity to handle 
      differences in perceived prepulse intensities among strains, we identified a 
      significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for PPI at the mid-distal end of 
      chromosome 17. A measure of attentional processing in the five-choice serial 
      reaction time task, response variability, mapped to a different locus on 
      proximal-mid chromosome 16. In addition, the estimated genetic and environmental 
      correlations between PPI and several attentional phenotypes were low and not 
      significant. Taken together, the observation of separate genetic loci for PPI and 
      attention and the absence of genetic and environmental correlations indicate that 
      differences in sensorimotor gating do not contribute to differences in 
      attentional performance. Therefore, it is worth pursuing the causative genes 
      residing in both attention and PPI QTL, as these may contribute to separate

TI  - Comprehensive QTL mapping survey dissects the complex fruit texture physiology in 
      apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.).
PG  - 1107-21

AB  - Fruit ripening is a complex physiological process in plants whereby cell wall 
      programmed changes occur mainly to promote seed dispersal. Cell wall modification 
      also directly regulates the textural properties, a fundamental aspect of fruit 
      quality. In this study, two full-sib populations of apple, with 'Fuji' as the 
      common maternal parent, crossed with 'Delearly' and 'Pink Lady', were used to 
      understand the control of fruit texture by QTL mapping and in silico gene mining. 
      Texture was dissected with a novel high resolution phenomics strategy, 
      simultaneously profiling both mechanical and acoustic fruit texture components. 
      In 'Fuji × Delearly' nine linkage groups were associated with QTLs accounting 
      from 15.6% to 49% of the total variance, and a highly significant QTL cluster for 
      both textural components was mapped on chromosome 10 and co-located with Md-PG1, 
      a polygalacturonase gene that, in apple, is known to be involved in cell wall 
      metabolism processes. In addition, other candidate genes related to Md-NOR and 
      Md-RIN transcription factors, Md-Pel (pectate lyase), and Md-ACS1 were mapped 
      within statistical intervals. In 'Fuji × Pink Lady', a smaller set of linkage 
      groups associated with the QTLs identified for fruit texture (15.9-34.6% 
      variance) was observed. The analysis of the phenotypic variance over a 
      two-dimensional PCA plot highlighted a transgressive segregation for this 
      progeny, revealing two QTL sets distinctively related to both mechanical and 
      acoustic texture components. The mining of the apple genome allowed the discovery 
      of the gene inventory underlying each QTL, and functional profile assessment 
      unravelled specific gene expression patterns of these candidate genes.

AB  - Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying complex traits is one of the next 
      frontiers in biology. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has become an 
      important model for elucidating the mechanisms that govern natural genetic and 
      phenotypic variation. This success is partially due to its intrinsic biological 
      features, such as the short sexual generation time, high meiotic recombination 
      rate, and small genome size. Precise reverse genetics technologies allow the high 
      throughput manipulation of genetic information with exquisite precision, offering 
      the unique opportunity to experimentally measure the phenotypic effect of genetic 
      variants. Population genomic and phenomic studies have revealed widespread 
      variation between diverged populations, characteristic of man-made environments, 
      as well as geographic clusters of wild strains along with naturally occurring 
      recombinant strains (mosaics). Here, we review these recent studies and provide a 
      perspective on how these previously unappreciated levels of variation can help to 
      bridge our understanding of the genotype-phenotype gap, keeping budding yeast at 
      the forefront of genetic studies. Not only are quantitative trait loci (QTL) 
      being mapped with high resolution down to the nucleotide, for the first time QTLs 
      of modest effect and complex interactions between these QTLs and between QTLs and 
      the environment are being determined experimentally at unprecedented levels using 
      next generation techniques of deep sequencing selected pools of individuals as 
      well as multi-generational crosses.

AB  - Genome-scale studies hold great promise for revealing novel plant biology. 
      Because of the complexity of these techniques, numerous considerations need to be 
      made before embarking on a study. Here we focus on the Arabidopsis model system 
      because of the wealth of available genome-scale data. Many approaches are 
      available that provide genome-scale information regarding the state of a given 
      organism (e.g. genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics 
      interactomics, ionomics, phenomics, etc.). Integration of all of these types of 
      data will be necessary for a comprehensive description of Arabidopsis. In this 
      review we propose that 'triangulation' among transcriptomics, proteomics and 
      metabolomics is a meaningful approach for beginning this integrative analysis and 
      uncovering a systems level perspective of Arabidopsis biology.

AB  - Increasing photosynthesis in C3 species has been identified as an approach to 
      increase the yield of crop plants. Most of our knowledge of photosynthetic 
      performance has come from studies in which plants were grown in controlled growth 
      conditions but plants in natural environments have to cope with unpredictable and 
      rapidly changing conditions. Plants adapt to the light environment in which they 
      grow and this is demonstrated by the differences in anatomy and morphology of 
      leaves in sun and shade leaves. Superimposed on this are the dynamic responses of 
      plants to rapid changes in the light environment that occur throughout the day. 
      Application of next generation sequencing (NGS), QTL analysis and innovative 
      phenomic screening can provide information to underpin approaches for breeding of 
      higher yielding crop plants.

AB  - Neurological disorders comprise one of the largest groups of human diseases. Due 
      to the myriad symptoms and the extreme degree of clinical variability 
      characteristic of many neurological diseases, the differential diagnosis process 
      is extremely challenging. Even though most neurogenetic diseases are individually 
      rare, collectively, the subgroup of neurogenetic disorders is large, comprising 
      more than 2,400 different disorders. Recently, increasing efforts have been 
      undertaken to unravel the molecular basis of neurogenetic diseases and to 
      correlate pathogenetic mechanisms with clinical signs and symptoms. In order to 
      enable computer-based analyses, the systematic representation of the neurological 
      phenotype is of major importance. We demonstrate how the Human Phenotype Ontology 
      (HPO) can be incorporated into these efforts by providing a systematic semantic 
      representation of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human genetic diseases. 
      The combination of the HPO together with the Orphanet disease classification 
      represents a promising resource for automated disease classification, performing 
      computational clustering and analysis of the neurogenetic phenome. Furthermore, 
      standardized representations of neurologic phenotypic abnormalities employing the 
      HPO link neurological phenotypic abnormalities to anatomical and functional 
      entities represented in other biomedical ontologies through the semantic 
      references provided by the HPO.

AB  - There have been many attempts in cancer clinical-type classification by using a 
      dataset from a number of molecular layers of biological system. Despite these 
      efforts, however, it still remains difficult to elucidate the cancer phenotypes 
      because the cancer genome is neither simple nor independent but rather 
      complicated and dysregulated by multiple molecular mechanisms. Recently, 
      heterogeneous types of data, generated from all molecular levels of 'omic' 
      dimensions from genome to phenome, for instance, copy number variants at the 
      genome level, DNA methylation at the epigenome level, and gene expression and 
      microRNA at the transcriptome level, have become available. In this paper, we 
      propose an integrated framework that uses multi-level genomic data for prediction 
      of clinical outcomes in brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme, GBM) and ovarian 
      cancer (serous cystadenocarcinoma, OV). From empirical comparison results on 
      individual genomic data, we provide some preliminary insights about which level 
      of data is more informative to a given clinical-type classification problem and 
      justify these perceptions with the corresponding biological implications for each 
      type of cancer. For GBM, all clinical outcomes had a better the area under the 
      curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic when integrating multi-layers of 
      genomic data, 0.876 for survival to 0.832 for recurrence. Moreover, the better 
      AUCs were achieved from the integration approach for all clinical outcomes in OV 
      as well, ranging from 0.787 to 0.893. We found that the opportunity for success 
      in prediction of clinical outcomes in cancer was increased when the prediction 
      was based on the integration of multi-layers of genomic data. This study is 
      expecting to improve comprehension of the molecular pathogenesis and underlying 
      biology of both cancer types.

AB  - The ascomycete fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum (sexual stage: Gibberella 
      zeae) causes the devastating head blight or scab disease on wheat and barley, and 
      cob or ear rot disease on maize. Fusarium graminearum infection causes 
      significant crop and quality losses. In addition to roles as virulence factors 
      during pathogenesis, trichothecene mycotoxins (e.g. deoxynivalenol) produced by 
      this pathogen constitute a significant threat to human and animal health if 
      consumed in respective food or feed products. In the last few years, significant 
      progress has been made towards a better understanding of the processes involved 
      in F. graminearum pathogenesis, toxin biosynthesis and host resistance mechanisms 
      through the use of high-throughput genomic and phenomic technologies. In this 
      article, we briefly review these new advances and also discuss how future 
      research can contribute to the development of sustainable plant protection 
      strategies against this important plant pathogen.

LID - 10.1016/j.trsl.2012.01.020 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains a major challenge in nephrology and for 
      public health care, affecting 14% to 15% of the adult US population and consuming 
      significant health care resources. In the next 20 years, the number of patients 
      with end stage renal disease is projected to increase by 50%. Ideal biomarkers 
      that allow early identification of CKD patients at high risk of progression are 
      urgently needed for early and targeted treatment to improve patient care. Recent 
      success of integrating molecular approaches for personalized management of 
      neoplastic diseases, including diagnosis, staging, prognosis, treatment 
      selection, and monitoring, has strongly encouraged kidney researchers to pursue 
      molecular definitions of patients with kidney disease. Challenges for molecular 
      marker identification in CKD are a high degree of cellular heterogeneity of the 
      kidney and the paucity of human tissue availability for molecular studies. 
      Despite these limitations, potential molecular biomarker candidates have been 
      uncovered at multiple levels along the genome--phenome continuum. Here we will 
      review the identification and validation of potential genomic biomarker 
      candidates of CKD and CKD progression in clinical studies. The challenges in 
      predicting CKD progression, as well as the promises and opportunities resulting 
      from a molecular definition of CKD will be discussed.

AB  - About one-fifth of the genes in the budding yeast are essential for haploid 
      viability and cannot be functionally assessed using standard genetic approaches 
      such as gene deletion. To facilitate genetic analysis of essential genes, we and 
      others have assembled collections of yeast strains expressing 
      temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles of essential genes. To explore the phenotypes 
      caused by essential gene mutation we used a panel of genetically engineered 
      fluorescent markers to explore the morphology of cells in the ts strain 
      collection using high-throughput microscopy. Here, we describe the design and 
      implementation of an online database, PhenoM (Phenomics of yeast Mutants), for 
      storing, retrieving, visualizing and data mining the quantitative single-cell 
      measurements extracted from micrographs of the ts mutant cells. PhenoM allows 
      users to rapidly search and retrieve raw images and their quantified 
      morphological data for genes of interest. The database also provides several 
      data-mining tools, including a PhenoBlast module for phenotypic comparison 
      between mutant strains and a Gene Ontology module for functional enrichment 
      analysis of gene sets showing similar morphological alterations. The current 
      PhenoM version 1.0 contains 78,194 morphological images and 1,909,914 cells 
      covering six subcellular compartments or structures for 775 ts alleles spanning 
      491 essential genes. PhenoM is freely available at

PG  - 305-17
LID - 10.1152/physiolgenomics.00047.2011 [doi]
AB  - Identifying causal genes that underlie complex traits such as susceptibility to 
      disease is a primary aim of genetic and biomedical studies. Genetic mapping of 
      quantitative trait loci (QTL) and gene expression profiling based on 
      high-throughput technologies are common first approaches toward identifying 
      associations between genes and traits; however, it is often difficult to assess 
      whether the biological function of a putative candidate gene is consistent with a 
      particular phenotype. Here, we have implemented a network-based disease gene 
      prioritization approach for ranking genes associated with quantitative traits and 
      diseases in livestock species. The approach uses ortholog mapping and integrates 
      information on disease or trait phenotypes, gene-associated phenotypes, and 
      protein-protein interactions. It was used for ranking all known genes present in 
      the cattle genome for their potential roles in bovine mastitis. Gene-associated 
      phenome profile and transcriptome profile in response to Escherichia coli 
      infection in the mammary gland were integrated to make a global inference of 
      bovine genes involved in mastitis. The top ranked genes were highly enriched for 
      pathways and biological processes underlying inflammation and immune responses, 
      which supports the validity of our approach for identifying genes that are 
      relevant to animal health and disease. These gene-associated phenotypes were used 
      for a local prioritization of candidate genes located in a QTL affecting the 
      susceptibility to mastitis. Our study provides a general framework for 
      prioritizing genes associated with various complex traits in different species. 
      To our knowledge this is the first time that gene expression, ortholog mapping, 
      protein interactions, and biomedical text data have been integrated 
      systematically for ranking candidate genes in any livestock species.

TI  - High content screening in neurodegenerative diseases.
PG  - e3452
LID - 3452 [pii]
LID - 10.3791/3452 [doi]
AB  - The functional annotation of genomes, construction of molecular networks and 
      novel drug target identification, are important challenges that need to be 
      addressed as a matter of great urgency. Multiple complementary 'omics' approaches 
      have provided clues as to the genetic risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms 
      underlying numerous neurodegenerative diseases, but most findings still require 
      functional validation. For example, a recent genome wide association study for 
      Parkinson's Disease (PD), identified many new loci as risk factors for the 
      disease, but the underlying causative variant(s) or pathogenic mechanism is not 
      known. As each associated region can contain several genes, the functional 
      evaluation of each of the genes on phenotypes associated with the disease, using 
      traditional cell biology techniques would take too long. There is also a need to 
      understand the molecular networks that link genetic mutations to the phenotypes 
      they cause. It is expected that disease phenotypes are the result of multiple 
      interactions that have been disrupted. Reconstruction of these networks using 
      traditional molecular methods would be time consuming. Moreover, network 
      predictions from independent studies of individual components, the reductionism 
      approach, will probably underestimate the network complexity. This 
      underestimation could, in part, explain the low success rate of drug approval due 
      to undesirable or toxic side effects. Gaining a network perspective of disease 
      related pathways using HT/HC cellular screening approaches, and identifying key 
      nodes within these pathways, could lead to the identification of targets that are 
      more suited for therapeutic intervention. High-throughput screening (HTS) is an 
      ideal methodology to address these issues. but traditional methods were one 
      dimensional whole-well cell assays, that used simplistic readouts for complex 
      biological processes. They were unable to simultaneously quantify the many 
      phenotypes observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as axonal transport 
      deficits or alterations in morphology properties. This approach could not be used 
      to investigate the dynamic nature of cellular processes or pathogenic events that 
      occur in a subset of cells. To quantify such features one has to move to 
      multi-dimensional phenotypes termed high-content screening (HCS). HCS is the 
      cell-based quantification of several processes simultaneously, which provides a 
      more detailed representation of the cellular response to various perturbations 
      compared to HTS. HCS has many advantages over HTS, but conducting a 
      high-throughput (HT)-high-content (HC) screen in neuronal models is problematic 
      due to high cost, environmental variation and human error. In order to detect 
      cellular responses on a 'phenomics' scale using HC imaging one has to reduce 
      variation and error, while increasing sensitivity and reproducibility. Herein we 
      describe a method to accurately and reliably conduct shRNA screens using 
      automated cell culturing and HC imaging in neuronal cellular models. We describe 
      how we have used this methodology to identify modulators for one particular 
      protein, DJ1, which when mutated causes autosomal recessive parkinsonism. 
      Combining the versatility of HC imaging with HT methods, it is possible to 
      accurately quantify a plethora of phenotypes. This could subsequently be utilized 
      to advance our understanding of the genome, the pathways involved in disease 
      pathogenesis as well as identify potential therapeutic targets.

      discovery.

AB  - Understanding the categorization of human diseases is critical for reliably 
      identifying disease causal genes. Recently, genome-wide studies of abnormal 
      chromosomal locations related to diseases have mapped >2000 phenotype-gene 
      relations, which provide valuable information for classifying diseases and 
      identifying candidate genes as drug targets. In this article, a regularized 
      non-negative matrix tri-factorization (R-NMTF) algorithm is introduced to 
      co-cluster phenotypes and genes, and simultaneously detect associations between 
      the detected phenotype clusters and gene clusters. The R-NMTF algorithm 
      factorizes the phenotype-gene association matrix under the prior knowledge from 
      phenotype similarity network and protein-protein interaction network, supervised 
      by the label information from known disease classes and biological pathways. In 
      the experiments on disease phenotype-gene associations in OMIM and KEGG disease 
      pathways, R-NMTF significantly improved the classification of disease phenotypes 
      and disease pathway genes compared with support vector machines and Label 
      Propagation in cross-validation on the annotated phenotypes and genes. The newly 
      predicted phenotypes in each disease class are highly consistent with human 
      phenotype ontology annotations. The roles of the new member genes in the disease 
      pathways are examined and validated in the protein-protein interaction 
      subnetworks. Extensive literature review also confirmed many new members of the 
      disease classes and pathways as well as the predicted associations between 
      disease phenotype classes and pathways.

AB  - β-blockers and β-agonists are primarily used to treat cardiovascular diseases. 
      Inter-individual variability in response to both drug classes is well recognized, 
      yet the identity and relative contribution of the genetic players involved are 
      poorly understood. This work is the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
      addressing the values and susceptibility of cardiovascular-related traits to a 
      selective β(1)-blocker, Atenolol (ate), and a β-agonist, Isoproterenol (iso). The 
      phenotypic dataset consisted of 27 highly heritable traits, each measured across 
      22 inbred mouse strains and four pharmacological conditions. The genotypic panel 
      comprised 79922 informative SNPs of the mouse HapMap resource. Associations were 
      mapped by Efficient Mixed Model Association (EMMA), a method that corrects for 
      the population structure and genetic relatedness of the various strains. A total 
      of 205 separate genome-wide scans were analyzed. The most significant hits 
      include three candidate loci related to cardiac and body weight, three loci for 
      electrocardiographic (ECG) values, two loci for the susceptibility of atrial 
      weight index to iso, four loci for the susceptibility of systolic blood pressure 
      (SBP) to perturbations of the β-adrenergic system, and one locus for the 
      responsiveness of QTc (p<10(-8)). An additional 60 loci were suggestive for one 
      or the other of the 27 traits, while 46 others were suggestive for one or the 
      other drug effects (p<10(-6)). Most hits tagged unexpected regions, yet at least 
      two loci for the susceptibility of SBP to β-adrenergic drugs pointed at members 
      of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Loci for cardiac-related traits were 
      preferentially enriched in genes expressed in the heart, while 23% of the 
      testable loci were replicated with datasets of the Mouse Phenome Database (MPD). 
      Altogether these data and validation tests indicate that the mapped loci are 
      relevant to the traits and responses studied.

TI  - Supervised segmentation of phenotype descriptions for the human skeletal phenome 
      using hybrid methods.
PG  - 265
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-13-265 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the course of the last few years there has been a significant 
      amount of research performed on ontology-based formalization of phenotype 
      descriptions. In order to fully capture the intrinsic value and knowledge 
      expressed within them, we need to take advantage of their inner structure, which 
      implicitly combines qualities and anatomical entities. The first step in this 
      process is the segmentation of the phenotype descriptions into their atomic 
      elements. RESULTS: We present a two-phase hybrid segmentation method that 
      combines a series individual classifiers using different aggregation schemes (set 
      operations and simple majority voting). The approach is tested on a corpus 
      comprised of skeletal phenotype descriptions emerged from the Human Phenotype 
      Ontology. Experimental results show that the best hybrid method achieves an 
      F-Score of 97.05% in the first phase and F-Scores of 97.16% / 94.50% in the 
      second phase. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the initial segmentation of 
      anatomical entities and qualities (phase I) is not affected by the presence / 
      absence of external resources, such as domain dictionaries. From a generic 
      perspective, hybrid methods may not always improve the segmentation accuracy as 
      they are heavily dependent on the goal and data characteristics.

PG  - 1331-41
LID - 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2012.02.010 [doi]
AB  - Drawing on converging behavioral, electrophysiological, and imaging evidence, we 
      advance an hypothesis for a cognitive phenotype of a SNP in the CHRNA4 gene 
      encoding the α(4) subunit of α(4)β(2) nicotinic receptors. First, we review 
      evidence that visuospatial attention can be decomposed into several component 
      processes. Secondly, we consider evidence that one component, redirection of 
      attention, is modulated by the nicotinic cholinergic system. Third, we review 
      evidence that nicotinic stimulation exerts effects at the network level. Fourth, 
      we consider evidence that normal variation in this SNP exerts nicotine-like 
      modulatory effects on visuospatial attention. Fifth, we hypothesize that the 
      cognitive phenotype of the CHRNA4 rs1044396 SNP is characterized by greater 
      ability of T allele carriers to preferentially process events in the attentional 
      focus compared to events outside the attentional focus. Finally, we consider 
      effects of the CHNRA4 rs1044396 SNP on brain activity and cognition in light of 
      our hypothesized cognitive phenotype. This hypothesis makes an important 
      contribution to the development of cognitive phenomics by arguing for a cognitive 
      phenotype of CHRNA4.

      ontologies.
PG  - 669-79
LID - 10.1007/s00335-012-9404-4 [doi]
AB  - A major aim of the biological sciences is to gain an understanding of human 
      physiology and disease. One important step towards such a goal is the discovery 
      of the function of genes that will lead to a better understanding of the 
      physiology and pathophysiology of organisms, which will ultimately lead to better 
      diagnosis and therapy. Our increasing ability to phenotypically characterise 
      genetic variants of model organisms coupled with systematic and hypothesis-driven 
      mutagenesis is resulting in a wealth of information that could potentially 
      provide insight into the functions of all genes in an organism. The challenge we 
      are now facing is to develop computational methods that can integrate and analyse 
      such data. The introduction of formal ontologies that make their semantics 
      explicit and accessible to automated reasoning provides the tantalizing 
      possibility of standardizing biomedical knowledge allowing for novel, powerful 
      queries that bridge multiple domains, disciplines, species, and levels of 
      granularity. We review recent computational approaches that facilitate the 
      integration of experimental data from model organisms with clinical observations 
      in humans. These methods foster novel cross-species analysis approaches, thereby 
      enabling comparative phenomics and leading to the potential of translating basic 
      discoveries from the model systems into diagnostic and therapeutic advances at 
      the clinical level.

AB  - Data linking specific ages or age ranges with disease are abundant in biomedical 
      literature. However, these data are organized such that searching for 
      age-phenotype relationships is difficult. Recently, we described the Age-Phenome 
      Knowledge-base (APK), a computational platform for storage and retrieval of 
      information concerning age-related phenotypic patterns. Here, we report that data 
      derived from over 1.5 million human-related PubMed abstracts have been added to 
      APK. Using a text-mining pipeline, 35,683 entries which describe relationships 
      between age and phenotype (such as disease) have been introduced into the 
      database. Comparing the results to those obtained by a human reader reveals that 
      the overall accuracy of these entries is estimated to exceed 80%. The usefulness 
      of these data for obtaining new insight regarding age-disease relationships is 
      demonstrated using clustering analysis, which is shown to capture obvious, as 
      well as potentially interesting relationships between diseases. In addition, a 
      new tool for browsing and searching the APK database is presented. We thus 
      present a unique resource and a new framework for studying age-disease 
      relationships and other phenotypic processes.

TI  - Breeding for Bio-ethanol Production in Lolium perenne L.: Association of Allelic 
      Variation with High Water-Soluble Carbohydrate Content.
PG  - 149-157
AB  - Increasing the extractable sugar yield from perennial crops is one strategy to 
      generate renewable fuels such as bio-ethanol. Lolium perenne L. (perennial 
      ryegrass) can contain significant (>30% dry matter) water-soluble sugars in the 
      form of polymeric fructan which is readily extracted, broken down and fermented 
      to bio-ethanol. A population of L. perenne generated from four parents which 
      differed in water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content was subjected to multiple 
      rounds of selection and recombination on the basis of early spring WSC content to 
      produce a high WSC, and a low WSC population. A control population was generated 
      by selecting the same number of plants at random. The alleles present at six 
      candidate gene loci were analysed before and after selection and correlated to 
      WSC content. Significant differences in the allele frequency of L. perenne 
      soluble-acid invertase1:4 were observed between the three populations with one 
      haplotype significantly associated with the high WSC C2(S+) population (after 
      three rounds of selection and two rounds of recombination). Moreover, WSC content 
      was also associated with biomass accumulation. Thus, in addition to a 2.84-fold 
      increase in WSC yield, the C2(S+) population also had 1.48-fold more biomass per 
      plant, resulting in 3.9-fold higher WSC yield per plant than the control 
      population.

TI  - Clinical expression of bipolar disorder type I as a function of age and polarity 
      at onset: convergent findings in samples from France and the United States.
PG  - e561-6
LID - 10.4088/JCP.10m06504 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation, course, and comorbidities of bipolar 
      disorder type I are highly heterogeneous, and this variability remains poorly 
      predictable. Certain onset characteristics (eg, age and polarity at onset) may 
      delineate subgroups differing in clinical expression and outcome. METHOD: We 
      retrospectively investigated the association between both age and polarity at 
      onset and the clinical characteristics of bipolar I disorder (DSM-IV) in 2 
      independent adult samples: 480 French patients assessed in 1992-2006 (patients 
      had been recruited from 3 university-affiliated psychiatry departments) and 714 
      US patients assessed in 1991-2003 (data were extracted from the Bipolar Disorder 
      Phenome Database). RESULTS: Polarity at onset correlated with subsequent 
      predominance (P < .001). Most patients experienced a depressive onset (57.9% in 
      France vs 71.0% in the United States; P < .001) associated with a higher density 
      of depressive episodes, suicidal behavior, and alcohol misuse. A manic onset was 
      associated with a higher density of manic episodes. Early onset was frequent in 
      both countries (42% in France vs 68% in the United States; P < .001) and was 
      associated with suicidal behavior and cannabis and cocaine/opiate misuse. 
      Sensitivity for the prediction of clinical characteristics was 1%-35% for age at 
      onset and 26%-47% for polarity at onset. CONCLUSIONS: Onset characteristics are 
      associated with subsequent predominant polarity, suicidal behavior, and substance 
      misuse in bipolar I disorder. These findings may facilitate personalized 
      treatment strategies based on type of onset and may also facilitate early focused 
      strategies for preventing comorbidity. Given the relatively low sensitivity and 
      specificity of these onset characteristics for predicting clinical variables, the 
      relevance of age and polarity at onset as specifiers in nosographical 
      classifications will require further studies. However, polarity at onset may be 
      the more relevant specifier, with further investigation required for age at 
      onset.

AB  - Cognitive deficits are core to the disability associated with many psychiatric 
      disorders. Both variation in cognition and psychiatric risk show substantial 
      heritability, with overlapping genetic variants contributing to both. 
      Unsurprisingly, therefore, these fields have been mutually beneficial : just as 
      cognitive studies of psychiatric risk variants may identify genes involved in 
      cognition, so too can genome-wide studies based on cognitive phenotypes lead to 
      genes relevant to psychiatric aetiology. The purpose of this review is to 
      consider the main issues involved in the phenotypic characterization of 
      cognition, and to describe the challenges associated with the transition to 
      genomewide approaches. We conclude by describing the approaches currently being 
      taken by the international consortia involving many investigators in the field 
      internationally (e.g. Cognitive Genomics Consortium; COGENT) to overcome these 
      challenges.

TI  - Finding genome-transcriptome-phenome association with structured association 
      mapping and visualization in GenAMap.
PG  - 327-38
AB  - Despite the success of genome-wide association studies in detecting novel disease 
      variants, we are still far from a complete understanding of the mechanisms 
      through which variants cause disease. Most of previous studies have considered 
      only genome-phenome associations. However, the integration of transcriptome data 
      may help further elucidate the mechanisms through which genetic mutations lead to 
      disease and uncover potential pathways to target for treatment. We present a 
      novel structured association mapping strategy for finding 
      genome-transcriptome-phenome associations when SNP, gene-expression, and 
      phenotype data are available for the same cohort. We do so via a two-step 
      procedure where genome-transcriptome associations are identified by GFlasso, a 
      sparse regression technique presented previously. Transcriptome-phenome 
      associations are then found by a novel proposed method called gGFlasso, which 
      leverages structure inherent in the genes and phenotypic traits. Due to the 
      complex nature of three-way association results, visualization tools can aid in 
      the discovery of causal SNPs and regulatory mechanisms affecting diseases. Using 
      wellgrounded visualization techniques, we have designed new visualizations that 
      filter through large three-way association results to detect interesting SNPs and 
      associated genes and traits. The two-step GFlasso-gGFlasso algorithmic approach 
      and new visualizations are integrated into GenAMap, a visual analytics system for 
      structured association mapping. Results on simulated datasets show that our 
      approach has the potential to increase the sensitivity and specificity of 
      association studies, compared to existing procedures that do not exploit the full 
      structural information of the data. We report results from an analysis on a 
      publically available mouse dataset, showing that identified SNP-gene-trait 
      associations are compatible with known biology.

TI  - Antipsychotic-induced vacuous chewing movements and extrapyramidal side effects 
      are highly heritable in mice.
PG  - 147-55
LID - 10.1038/tpj.2010.82 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacogenomics is yet to fulfill its promise of manifestly altering clinical 
      medicine. As one example, a predictive test for tardive dyskinesia (TD) (an 
      adverse drug reaction consequent to antipsychotic exposure) could greatly improve 
      the clinical treatment of schizophrenia but human studies are equivocal. A 
      complementary approach is the mouse-then-human design in which a valid mouse 
      model is used to identify susceptibility loci, which are subsequently tested in 
      human samples. We used inbred mouse strains from the Mouse Phenome Project to 
      estimate the heritability of haloperidol-induced activity and orofacial 
      phenotypes. In all, 159 mice from 27 inbred strains were chronically treated with 
      haloperidol (3 mg kg(-1) per day via subdermal slow-release pellets) and 
      monitored for the development of vacuous chewing movements (VCMs; the mouse 
      analog of TD) and other movement phenotypes derived from open-field activity and 
      the inclined screen test. The test battery was assessed at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 
      days in relation to haloperidol exposure. As expected, haloperidol caused marked 
      changes in VCMs, activity in the open field and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). 
      Unexpectedly, factor analysis demonstrated that these measures were imprecise 
      assessments of a latent construct rather than discrete constructs. The 
      heritability of a composite phenotype was ∼0.9 after incorporation of the 
      longitudinal nature of the design. Murine VCMs are a face valid animal model of 
      antipsychotic-induced TD, and heritability estimates from this study support the 
      feasibility of mapping of susceptibility loci for VCMs.

TI  - OPTIMAS-DW: a comprehensive transcriptomics, metabolomics, ionomics, proteomics 
      and phenomics data resource for maize.
PG  - 245
LID - 10.1186/1471-2229-12-245 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maize is a major crop plant, grown for human and animal nutrition, as 
      well as a renewable resource for bioenergy. When looking at the problems of 
      limited fossil fuels, the growth of the world's population or the world's climate 
      change, it is important to find ways to increase the yield and biomass of maize 
      and to study how it reacts to specific abiotic and biotic stress situations. 
      Within the OPTIMAS systems biology project maize plants were grown under a large 
      set of controlled stress conditions, phenotypically characterised and plant 
      material was harvested to analyse the effect of specific environmental conditions 
      or developmental stages. Transcriptomic, metabolomic, ionomic and proteomic 
      parameters were measured from the same plant material allowing the comparison of 
      results across different omics domains. A data warehouse was developed to store 
      experimental data as well as analysis results of the performed experiments. 
      DESCRIPTION: The OPTIMAS Data Warehouse (OPTIMAS-DW) is a comprehensive data 
      collection for maize and integrates data from different data domains such as 
      transcriptomics, metabolomics, ionomics, proteomics and phenomics. Within the 
      OPTIMAS project, a 44K oligo chip was designed and annotated to describe the 
      functions of the selected unigenes. Several treatment- and plant growth stage 
      experiments were performed and measured data were filled into data templates and 
      imported into the data warehouse by a Java based import tool. A web interface 
      allows users to browse through all stored experiment data in OPTIMAS-DW including 
      all data domains. Furthermore, the user can filter the data to extract 
      information of particular interest. All data can be exported into different file 
      formats for further data analysis and visualisation. The data analysis integrates 
      data from different data domains and enables the user to find answers to 
      different systems biology questions. Finally, maize specific pathway information 
      is provided. CONCLUSIONS: With OPTIMAS-DW a data warehouse for maize was 
      established, which is able to handle different data domains, comprises several 
      analysis results that will support researchers within their work and supports 
      systems biological research in particular. The system is available at 
      http://www.optimas-bioenergy.org/optimas_dw.

TI  - MouseFinder: Candidate disease genes from mouse phenotype data.
PG  - 858-66
LID - 10.1002/humu.22051 [doi]
AB  - Mouse phenotype data represents a valuable resource for the identification of 
      disease-associated genes, especially where the molecular basis is unknown and 
      there is no clue to the candidate gene's function, pathway involvement or 
      expression pattern. However, until recently these data have not been 
      systematically used due to difficulties in mapping between clinical features 
      observed in humans and mouse phenotype annotations. Here, we describe a semantic 
      approach to solve this problem and demonstrate highly significant recall of known 
      disease-gene associations and orthology relationships. A Web application 
      (MouseFinder; www.mousemodels.org) has been developed to allow users to search 
      the results of our whole-phenome comparison of human and mouse. We demonstrate 
      its use in identifying ARTN as a strong candidate gene within the 1p34.1-p32 
      mapped locus for a hereditary form of ptosis.

AB  - Considering cells as biofactories, we aimed to optimize its internal processes by 
      using the same engineering principles that large industries are implementing 
      nowadays: lean manufacturing. We have applied reverse engineering computational 
      methods to transcriptomic, metabolomic and phenomic data obtained from a 
      collection of tomato recombinant inbreed lines to formulate a kinetic and 
      constraint-based model that efficiently describes the cellular metabolism from 
      expression of a minimal core of genes. Based on predicted metabolic profiles, a 
      close association with agronomic and organoleptic properties of the ripe fruit 
      was revealed with high statistical confidence. Inspired in a synthetic biology 
      approach, the model was used for exploring the landscape of all possible local 
      transcriptional changes with the aim of engineering tomato fruits with fine-tuned 
      biotechnological properties. The method was validated by the ability of the 
      proposed genomes, engineered for modified desired agronomic traits, to 
      recapitulate experimental correlations between associated metabolites.

AB  - This chapter focuses on two database resources that can facilitate the use of the 
      laboratory mouse for genetic and genomic studies of behavior. The Mouse Phenome 
      Database (MPD) contains baseline measurement data for a wide variety of 
      phenotypes in inbred strains of mice and commonly used reference populations. MPD 
      also supports tools for the visualization and statistical analysis of phenotype 
      data. The Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database is a comprehensive resource for 
      genetics and genomics of the laboratory mouse. MGI collects and integrates 
      information about function, phenotype, disease associations, and developmental 
      gene expression for all genome features in the laboratory mouse.

      including activation of microglia and perivascular macrophages, increases in 
      inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in brain tissue and CSF, and abnormal 
      peripheral monocyte cell function. Dendritic cells are major players in innate 
      immunity and have important functions in the phagocytosis of pathogens or debris, 
      antigen presentation, activation of naïve T cells, induction of tolerance and 
      cytokine/chemokine production. In this study, we assessed circulating frequencies 
      of myeloid dendritic cells (defined as Lin-1(-)BDCA1(+)CD11c(+) and 
      Lin-1(-)BDCA3(+)CD123(-)) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells 
      (Lin-1(-)BDCA2(+)CD123(+) or Lin-1(-)BDCA4(+) CD11c(-)) in 57 children with ASD, 
      and 29 typically developing controls of the same age, all of who were enrolled as 
      part of the Autism Phenome Project (APP). The frequencies of dendritic cells and 
      associations with behavioral assessment and MRI measurements of amygdala volume 
      were compared in the same participants. The frequencies of myeloid dendritic 
      cells were significantly increased in children with ASD compared to typically 
      developing controls (p<0.03). Elevated frequencies of myeloid dendritic cells 
      were positively associated with abnormal right and left amygdala enlargement, 
      severity of gastrointestinal symptoms and increased repetitive behaviors. The 
      frequencies of plasmacytoid dendritic cells were also associated with amygdala 
      volumes as well as developmental regression in children with ASD. Dendritic cells 
      play key roles in modulating immune responses and differences in frequencies or 
      functions of these cells may result in immune dysfunction in children with ASD. 
      These data further implicate innate immune cells in the complex pathophysiology 
      of ASD.

AB  - An original yeast-based phenomic model for DeltaF508 CFTR, by far the most 
      prevalent allele of the CFTR gene responsible for cystic fibrosis, has been 
      developed by the groups of Elizabeth A Miller and John L Hartman. This model 
      allows potential modifier genes of the DeltaF508 CFTR allele to be uncovered. 
      Hence, brewer's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is not only needed at happy hour, 
      it also represents an invaluable tool for human geneticists.

PG  - 399-413
LID - 10.1007/978-1-61779-986-0_27 [doi]
AB  - The phenotypic response of plants to high external levels of NaCl is very dynamic 
      so the methods used for phenotyping should be able to capture those dynamics. 
      Non-destructive high-throughput plant imaging enables researchers to measure salt 
      stress-induced changes in plant growth over time. In addition, the color 
      information of the digital images allows the quantification of leaf senescence 
      induced through long-term exposure to NaCl. In combination with destructive leaf 
      sampling to measure leaf [Na(+)], this approach allows dissection of salinity 
      tolerance into its individual components.

TI  - The facial evolution: looking backward and moving forward.
PG  - 14-22
LID - 10.1002/humu.22219 [doi]
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) facial analysis is ideal for high-resolution, nonionizing, 
      noninvasive objective, high-throughput phenotypic, and phenomic studies. It is a 
      natural complement to (epi)genetic technologies to facilitate advances in the 
      understanding of rare and common diseases. The face is uniquely reflective of the 
      primordial tissues, and there is evidence supporting the application of 3D facial 
      analysis to the investigation of variation and disease including studies showing 
      that the face can reflect systemic health, provides diagnostic clues to 
      disorders, and that facial variation reflects biological pathways. In addition, 
      facial variation has been related to evolutionary factors. The purpose of this 
      review is to look backward to suggest that knowledge of human evolution supports, 
      and may instruct, the application and interpretation of studies of facial 
      morphology for documentation of human variation and investigation of its 
      relationships with health and disease. Furthermore, in the context of advances of 
      deep phenotyping and data integration, to look forward to suggest approaches to 
      scalable implementation of facial analysis, and to suggest avenues for future 
      research and clinical application of this technology.

TI  - Plant phenome to genome: a mini-review.
PG  - iii-viii
LID - 10.1071/FPv39n7_FO [doi]
AB  - Rapid advances in biotechnologies have provided a template for defining the 
      genome-transcriptome-proteome in many plant species and these advances now 
      highlight a particular challenge to link the molecular biology-based studies to 
      changes in the phenome of plant species. Selected examples are provided to review 
      advances in defining environment-phenotype interactions, the 
      genome-transcriptome-proteome in plants and translating research outputs more 
      broadly to society. The specific examples include computer modelling of plant 
      phenotypes and responses to environmental signals, advances in small molecule 
      signal transduction, visualising macromolecules and defining the complex genomes 
      that are important to society. The need to translate research outputs to society 
      more broadly is also discussed.
