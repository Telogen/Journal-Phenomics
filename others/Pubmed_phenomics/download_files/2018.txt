TI  - Global analysis of an exponential model of cell proliferation for estimation of 
      cell cycle duration in the root apical meristem of angiosperms.
PG  - 811-822
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcx216 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Information on cell cycle duration (T) in the root apical 
      meristem (RAM) provides insight into root growth, development and evolution. We 
      have previously proposed a simple method for evaluating T based on the dynamics 
      of root growth (V), the number of cells in the RAM (Nm) and the length of fully 
      elongated cells (l), which we named the rate-of-cell-production (RCP) method. 
      Here, a global analysis was performed to confirm the reliability of this method 
      in a range of angiosperm species and to assess the advantages of this approach. 
      METHODS: We measured V, Nm and l from live or fixed cleared primary roots of 
      seedlings or adventitious roots of bulbs and used this information to estimate 
      the average T values in 73 angiosperm species via the RCP method. The results 
      were then compared with published data obtained using the classical but laborious 
      and time-consuming 3H-thymidine method. KEY RESULTS: In most species examined, 
      the T values obtained by the RCP method were nearly identical to those obtained 
      by the 3H-thymidine method. CONCLUSIONS: The global analysis demonstrated that 
      the relationship between the variables V, Nm and l in roots in the steady state 
      of growth is correctly described by the equation T = (ln2 Nm l)V-1. Thus, the RCP 
      method enables cell cycle duration in the RAM to be rapidly and accurately 
      determined. This method can be performed using live or fixed roots for each 
      individual cell type. The simplicity of the approach suggests that it will be 
      widely used in phenomics, evolutionary ecology and other plant biology studies.

PG  - 85-100

AB  - Both theoretical and experimental evidence indicate that synaptic excitation and 
      inhibition in the cerebral cortex are well-balanced during the resting state and 
      sensory processing. Here, we briefly summarize the evidence for how neural 
      circuits are adjusted to achieve this balance. Then, we discuss how such 
      excitatory and inhibitory balance shapes stimulus representation and information 
      propagation, two basic functions of neural coding. We also point out the benefit 
      of adopting such a balance during neural coding. We conclude that excitatory and 
      inhibitory balance may be a fundamental mechanism underlying efficient coding.

      throughout Maize Development.

AB  - Gene expression variation is a key component underlying phenotypic variation and 
      heterosis. Transcriptome profiling was performed on 23 different tissues or 
      developmental stages of two maize inbreds, B73 and Mo17, as well as their F(1) 
      hybrid. The obtained large-scale datasets provided opportunities to monitor the 
      developmental dynamics of differential expression, additivity for gene 
      expression, and regulatory variation. The transcriptome can be divided into 
      ∼30 000 genes that are expressed in at least one tissue of one inbred and an 
      additional ∼10 000 ″silent" genes that are not expressed in any tissue of any 
      genotype, 90% of which are non-syntenic relative to other grasses. Many (∼74%) of 
      the expressed genes exhibit differential expression in at least one tissue. 
      However, the majority of genes with differential expression do not exhibit 
      consistent differential expression in different tissues. These genes often 
      exhibit tissue-specific differential expression with equivalent expression in 
      other tissues, and in many cases they switch the directionality of differential 
      expression in different tissues. This suggests widespread variation for 
      tissue-specific regulation of gene expression between the two maize inbreds B73 
      and Mo17. Nearly 5000 genes are expressed in only one parent in at least one 
      tissue (single parent expression) and 97% of these genes are expressed at 
      mid-parent levels or higher in the hybrid, providing extensive opportunities for 
      hybrid complementation in heterosis. In general, additive expression patterns are 
      much more common than non-additive patterns, and this trend is more pronounced 
      for genes with strong differential expression or single parent expression. There 
      is relatively little evidence for non-additive expression patterns that are 
      maintained in multiple tissues. The analysis of allele-specific expression 
      allowed classification of cis- and trans-regulatory variation. Genes with 
      cis-regulatory variation often exhibit additive expression and tend to have more 
      consistent regulatory variation throughout development. In contrast, genes with 
      trans-regulatory variation are enriched for non-additive patterns and often 
      show tissue-specific differential expression. Taken together, this study provides 
      a deeper understanding of regulatory variation and the degree of additive gene 
      expression throughout maize development. The dynamic nature of differential 
      expression, additivity, and regulatory variation imply abundant variability for 
      tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms and suggest that connections between 
      transcriptome and phenome will require expression data from multiple tissues.

AB  - The accuracy of machine learning tasks critically depends on high quality ground 
      truth data. Therefore, in many cases, producing good ground truth data typically 
      involves trained professionals; however, this can be costly in time, effort, and 
      money. Here we explore the use of crowdsourcing to generate a large number of 
      training data of good quality. We explore an image analysis task involving the 
      segmentation of corn tassels from images taken in a field setting. We investigate 
      the accuracy, speed and other quality metrics when this task is performed by 
      students for academic credit, Amazon MTurk workers, and Master Amazon MTurk 
      workers. We conclude that the Amazon MTurk and Master Mturk workers perform 
      significantly better than the for-credit students, but with no significant 
      difference between the two MTurk worker types. Furthermore, the quality of the 
      segmentation produced by Amazon MTurk workers rivals that of an expert worker. We 
      provide best practices to assess the quality of ground truth data, and to compare 
      data quality produced by different sources. We conclude that properly managed 
      crowdsourcing can be used to establish large volumes of viable ground truth data 
      at a low cost and high quality, especially in the context of high throughput 
      plant phenotyping. We also provide several metrics for assessing the quality of 
      the generated datasets.

AB  - Predicting progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) is clinically important. In this study, we propose a dual-model radiomic 
      analysis with multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to 
      investigate promising risk factors associated with MCI conversion to AD. T1 
      structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) 
      positron emission tomography (PET) data, from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative 
      database, were collected from 131 patients with MCI who converted to AD within 3 
      years and 132 patients with MCI without conversion within 3 years. These subjects 
      were randomly partition into 70% training dataset and 30% test dataset with 
      multiple times. We fused MRI and PET images by wavelet method. In a subset of 
      subjects, a group comparison was performed using a two-sample t-test to determine 
      regions of interest (ROIs) associated with MCI conversion. 172 radiomic features 
      from ROIs for each individual were established using a published radiomics tool. 
      Finally, L1-penalized Cox model was constructed and Harrell's C index (C-index) 
      was used to evaluate prediction accuracy of the model. To evaluate the efficacy 
      of our proposed method, we used a same analysis framework to evaluate MRI and PET 
      data separately. We constructed prognostic Cox models with: clinical data, MRI 
      images, PET images, fused MRI/PET images, and clinical variables and fused 
      MRI/PET images in combination. The experimental results showed that captured ROIs 
      significantly associated with conversion to AD, such as gray matter atrophy in 
      the bilateral hippocampus and hypometabolism in the temporoparietal cortex. 
      Imaging model (MRI/PET/fused) provided significant enhancement in prediction of 
      conversion compared to clinical models, especially the fused-modality Cox model. 
      Moreover, the combination of fused-modality imaging and clinical variables 
      resulted in the greatest accuracy of prediction. The average C-index for the 
      clinical/MRI/PET/fused/combined model in the test dataset was 0.69, 0.73, 0.73 
      and 0.75, and 0.78, respectively. These results suggested that a combination of 
      radiomic analysis and Cox model analyses could be used successfully in survival 
      analysis and may be powerful tools for personalized precision medicine patients 
      with potential to undergo conversion from MCI to AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Gallstone disease has been related to a higher prevalence and 
      incidence of chronic conditions, such as dyslipidemia, obesity, and 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, limited data are available regarding 
      whether gallstone disease is related to mortality. METHODS: We examined the 
      relationship of a history of gallstone disease and risk of death, using Cox 
      proportional hazards regression analysis, among 86 030 women from the Nurses' 
      Health Study and 43 949 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. 
      RESULTS: During the up-to 32 years of follow-up, 34 011 all-cause deaths were 
      confirmed, of which 8138 were CVD deaths and 12 173 were cancer deaths. For the 
      participants with a history of gallstone disease compared with those without, the 
      hazard ratio of total mortality was 1.16 (95% confidence interval 1.13, 1.20), of 
      CVD mortality 1.11 (1.05, 1.17), of cancer mortality 1.15 (1.09, 1.20), and of 
      other mortality 1.19 (1.14, 1.25) from a pooled-analysis of women and men (all 
      P < 0.001). The multi-adjusted associations between gallstone disease and total 
      mortality persisted among women and men, and among participants with various risk 
      profiles including the different status of body mass index, hormone therapy use, 
      diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia (all P for interaction ≥ 0.09). 
      CONCLUSION: These data suggest that gallstone disease is associated with a higher 
      risk of total mortality and disease-specific mortality, including CVD and cancer 
      mortality, independent of various traditional risk factors.

TI  - PhenoSpD: an integrated toolkit for phenotypic correlation estimation and 
      multiple testing correction using GWAS summary statistics.
LID - 10.1093/gigascience/giy090 [doi]
LID - giy090
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying phenotypic correlations between complex traits and 
      diseases can provide useful etiological insights. Restricted access to much 
      individual-level phenotype data makes it difficult to estimate large-scale 
      phenotypic correlation across the human phenome. Two state-of-the-art methods, 
      metaCCA and LD score regression, provide an alternative approach to estimate 
      phenotypic correlation using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary 
      results. RESULTS: Here, we present an integrated R toolkit, PhenoSpD, to use LD 
      score regression to estimate phenotypic correlations using GWAS summary 
      statistics and to utilize the estimated phenotypic correlations to inform 
      correction of multiple testing for complex human traits using the spectral 
      decomposition of matrices (SpD). The simulations suggest that it is possible to 
      identify nonindependence of phenotypes using samples with partial overlap; as 
      overlap decreases, the estimated phenotypic correlations will attenuate toward 
      zero and multiple testing correction will be more stringent than in perfectly 
      overlapping samples. Also, in contrast to LD score regression, metaCCA will 
      provide approximate genetic correlations rather than phenotypic correlation, 
      which limits its application for multiple testing correction. In a case study, 
      PhenoSpD using UK Biobank GWAS results suggested 399.6 independent tests among 
      487 human traits, which is close to the 352.4 independent tests estimated using 
      true phenotypic correlation. We further applied PhenoSpD to an estimated 5,618 
      pair-wise phenotypic correlations among 107 metabolites using GWAS summary 
      statistics from Kettunen's publication and PhenoSpD suggested the equivalent of 
      33.5 independent tests for these metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: PhenoSpD extends the 
      use of summary-level results, providing a simple and conservative way to reduce 
      dimensionality for complex human traits using GWAS summary statistics. This is 
      particularly valuable in the age of large-scale biobank and consortia studies, 
      where GWAS results are much more accessible than individual-level data.

TI  - The Alzheimer's comorbidity phenome: mining from a large patient database and 
      phenome-driven genetics prediction.
PG  - 131-138
LID - 10.1093/jamiaopen/ooy050 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder and 
      has become a global public health problem. Intensive research has been conducted 
      for AD. But the pathophysiology of AD is still not elucidated. Disease 
      comorbidity often associates diseases with overlapping patterns of genetic 
      markers. This may inform a common etiology and suggest essential protein targets. 
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) 
      collects large-scale postmarketing surveillance data that provide a unique 
      opportunity to investigate disease co-occurrence pattern. We aim to construct a 
      heterogeneous network that integrates disease comorbidity network (DCN) from 
      FAERS with protein-protein interaction (PPI) to prioritize the AD risk genes 
      using network-based ranking algorithm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We built a DCN 
      based on indication data from FAERS using association rule mining. DCN was 
      further integrated with PPI network. We used random walk with restart ranking 
      algorithm to prioritize AD risk genes. RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of 
      our approach using AD risk genes curated from genetic association studies. Our 
      approach achieved an area under a receiver operating characteristic curve of 
      0.770. Top 500 ranked genes achieved 5.53-fold enrichment for known AD risk genes 
      as compared to random expectation. Pathway enrichment analysis using top-ranked 
      genes revealed that two novel pathways, ERBB and coagulation pathways, might be 
      involved in AD pathogenesis. CONCLUSION: We innovatively leveraged FAERS, a 
      comprehensive data resource for FDA postmarket drug safety surveillance, for 
      large-scale AD comorbidity mining. This exploratory study demonstrated the 
      potential of disease-comorbidities mining from FAERS in AD genetics discovery.

TI  - An integrative functional genomics framework for effective identification of 
      novel regulatory variants in genome-phenome studies.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/s13073-018-0513-x [doi]
LID - 7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genome-phenome studies have identified thousands of variants that are 
      statistically associated with disease or traits; however, their functional roles 
      are largely unclear. A comprehensive investigation of regulatory mechanisms and 
      the gene regulatory networks between phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) and 
      genome-wide association study (GWAS) is needed to identify novel regulatory 
      variants contributing to risk for human diseases. METHODS: In this study, we 
      developed an integrative functional genomics framework that maps 215,107 
      significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) traits generated from the PheWAS 
      Catalog and 28,870 genome-wide significant SNP traits collected from the GWAS 
      Catalog into a global human genome regulatory map via incorporating various 
      functional annotation data, including transcription factor (TF)-based motifs, 
      promoters, enhancers, and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) generated 
      from four major functional genomics databases: FANTOM5, ENCODE, NIH Roadmap, and 
      Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). In addition, we performed a tissue-specific 
      regulatory circuit analysis through the integration of the identified regulatory 
      variants and tissue-specific gene expression profiles in 7051 samples across 32 
      tissues from GTEx. RESULTS: We found that the disease-associated loci in both the 
      PheWAS and GWAS Catalogs were significantly enriched with functional SNPs. The 
      integration of functional annotations significantly improved the power of 
      detecting novel associations in PheWAS, through which we found a number of 
      functional associations with strong regulatory evidence in the PheWAS Catalog. 
      Finally, we constructed tissue-specific regulatory circuits for several complex 
      traits: mental diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer, via exploring 
      tissue-specific TF-promoter/enhancer-target gene interaction networks. We 
      uncovered several promising tissue-specific regulatory TFs or genes for 
      Alzheimer's disease (e.g. ZIC1 and STX1B) and asthma (e.g. CSF3 and IL1RL1). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study offers powerful tools for exploring the functional 
      consequences of variants generated from genome-phenome association studies in 
      terms of their mechanisms on affecting multiple complex diseases and traits.

AB  - Genome mutually interacts with internal and external environmental factors to 
      result in different phenome that contains two important elements of proteins and 
      metabolites, which link genome to predictive, preventive and personalized 
      medicine (PPPM) or precision medicine (PM). Proteomic variations are the final 
      presentation of the genomic and transcriptomic variations, and are involved in a 
      wide range of variations including copy number of protein, splicing, 
      post-translational modifications, translocation/re-distribution, spatial 
      conformation, and pathway-network systems. Metabolomic variations are the 
      comprehensive results originated from all types of in vivo substances, and are 
      involved in a wide range of alterations of metabolites generated from sugars, 
      lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, and metabolic network systems. Currently the 
      studies on variations in proteome and in metabolome are much insufficient in the 
      width and depth in the fields of proteomics and metabolomics. The development of 
      high-throughput, high-sensitivity, and especially high-reproducibility approaches 
      is necessary to maximize the coverage of variations in proteome and in 
      metabolome. The studies of proteomic and metabolomic variations directly result 
      in the discovery of effective biomarkers to clarify molecular mechanisms of a 
      disease, determine reliable therapeutic targets, and benefit precise prediction, 
      diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. It has more important scientific values in 
      PPPM or PM. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE.

TI  - Alternative polyadenylation analysis in animals and plants: newly developed 
      strategies for profiling, processing and validation.
PG  - 1709-1714
LID - 10.7150/ijbs.27168 [doi]
AB  - Alternative polyadenylation is an essential RNA processing event that contributes 
      significantly to regulation of transcriptome diversity and functional dynamics in 
      both animals and plants. Here we review newly developed next generation 
      sequencing methods for genome-wide profiling of alternative polyadenylation (APA) 
      sites, bioinformatics pipelines for data processing and both wet and dry 
      laboratory approaches for APA validation. The library construction methods 
      LITE-Seq (Low-Input 3'-Terminal sequencing) and PAC-seq (PolyA Click sequencing) 
      tag polyA(+) cDNA, while BAT-seq (BArcoded, three-prime specific sequencing) and 
      PAPERCLIP (Poly(A) binding Protein-mediated mRNA 3'End Retrieval by CrossLinking 
      ImmunoPrecipitation) enrich polyA(+) RNA. Interestingly, only WTTS-seq (Whole 
      Transcriptome Termini Site sequencing) targets both polyA(+) RNA and polyA(+) 
      cDNA. Varieties of bioinformatics pipelines are well established to pursue read 
      quality control, mapping, clustering, characterization and pathway analysis. The 
      RHAPA (RNase H alternative polyadenylation assay) and 3'RACE-seq (3' rapid 
      amplification of cDNA end sequencing) methods directly validate APA sites, while 
      WTSS-seq (whole transcriptome start site sequencing), RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) 
      and public APA databases can serve as indirect validation methods. We hope that 
      these tools, pipelines and resources trigger huge waves of interest in the 
      research community to investigate APA events underlying physiological, 
      pathological and psychological changes and thus understand the information 
      transfer events from genome to phenome relevant to economically important traits 
      in both animals and plants.

TI  - Alternative polyadenylation drives genome-to-phenome information detours in the 
      AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 knockout mice.
PG  - 6462

LID - 6462
AB  - Currently available mouse knockout (KO) lines remain largely uncharacterized for 
      genome-to-phenome (G2P) information flows. Here we test our hypothesis that 
      altered myogenesis seen in AMPKα1- and AMPKα2-KO mice is caused by use of 
      alternative polyadenylation sites (APSs). AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 are two α subunits of 
      adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which serves as a 
      cellular sensor in regulation of many biological events. A total of 56,483 APSs 
      were derived from gastrocnemius muscles. The differentially expressed APSs 
      (DE-APSs) that were down-regulated tended to be distal. The DE-APSs that were 
      related to reduced and increased muscle mass were down-regulated in AMPKα1-KO 
      mice, but up-regulated in AMPKα2-KO mice, respectively. Five genes: Car3 
      (carbonic anhydrase 3), Mylk4 (myosin light chain kinase family, member 4), Neb 
      (nebulin), Obscn (obscurin) and Pfkm (phosphofructokinase, muscle) utilized 
      different APSs with potentially antagonistic effects on muscle function. Overall, 
      gene knockout triggers genome plasticity via use of APSs, completing the G2P 
      processes. However, gene-based analysis failed to reach such a resolution. 
      Therefore, we propose that alternative transcripts are minimal functional units 
      in genomes and the traditional central dogma concept should be now examined under 
      a systems biology approach.

TI  - Structure of the mechanosensitive OSCA channels.
PG  - 850-858
LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0117-6 [doi]
AB  - Mechanosensitive ion channels convert mechanical stimuli into a flow of ions. 
      These channels are widely distributed from bacteria to higher plants and humans, 
      and are involved in many crucial physiological processes. Here we show that two 
      members of the OSCA protein family in Arabidopsis thaliana, namely AtOSCA1.1 and 
      AtOSCA3.1, belong to a new class of mechanosensitive ion channels. We solve the 
      structure of the AtOSCA1.1 channel at 3.5-Å resolution and AtOSCA3.1 at 4.8-Å 
      resolution by cryo-electron microscopy. OSCA channels are symmetric dimers that 
      are mediated by cytosolic inter-subunit interactions. Strikingly, they have 
      structural similarity to the mammalian TMEM16 family proteins. Our structural 
      analysis accompanied with electrophysiological studies identifies the ion 
      permeation pathway within each subunit and suggests a conformational change model 
      for activation.

AB  - How we sense touch is fundamental for many physiological processes. However, the 
      underlying mechanism and molecular identity for touch sensation are largely 
      unknown. Here, we report on defective gentle-touch behavioral responses in brv1 
      loss-of-function Drosophila larvae. RNAi and Ca(2+) imaging confirmed the 
      involvement of Brv1 in sensing touch and demonstrated that Brv1 mediates the 
      mechanotransduction of class III dendritic arborization neurons. 
      Electrophysiological recordings further revealed that the expression of Brv1 
      protein in HEK293T cells gives rise to stretch-activated cation channels. 
      Purified Brv1 protein reconstituted into liposomes were found to sense stretch 
      stimuli. In addition, co-expression studies suggested that Brv1 amplifies the 
      response of mechanosensitive ion channel NOMPC (no mechanoreceptor potential C) 
      to touch stimuli. Altogether, these findings demonstrate a molecular entity that 
      mediates the gentle-touch response in Drosophila larvae, providing insights into 
      the molecular mechanisms of touch sensation.

TI  - Reconciling the father tongue and mother tongue hypotheses in Indo-European 
      populations.
PG  - 293-300
LID - 10.1093/nsr/nwy083 [doi]
AB  - In opposition to the mother tongue hypothesis, the father tongue hypothesis 
      states that humans tend to speak their fathers' language, based on a stronger 
      correlation of languages to paternal lineages (Y-chromosome) than to maternal 
      lineages (mitochondria). To reassess these two competing hypotheses, we conducted 
      a genetic-linguistic study of 34 modern Indo-European (IE) populations. In this 
      study, genetic histories of paternal and maternal migrations in these IE 
      populations were elucidated using phylogenetic networks of Y-chromosomal and 
      mitochondrial DNA haplogroups, respectively. Unlike previous studies, we 
      quantitatively characterized the languages based on lexical and phonemic systems 
      separately. We showed that genetic and linguistic distances are significantly 
      correlated with each other and that both are correlated with geographical 
      distances among these populations. However, when controlling for geographical 
      factors, only the correlation between the distances of paternal and lexical 
      characteristics, and between those of maternal and phonemic characteristics, 
      remained. These unbalanced correlations reconciled the two seemingly conflicting 
      hypotheses.

TI  - Is the clinical lipidomics a potential goldmine?
PG  - 421-423
LID - 10.1007/s10565-018-9441-1 [doi]
AB  - Clinical lipidomics is a new extension of lipidomics to study lipid profiles, 
      pathways, and networks by characterizing and quantifying the complete lipid 
      molecules in cells, biopsy, or body fluids of patients. It undoubtfully has more 
      values if lipidomics can be integrated with the data of clinical proteomic, 
      genomic, and phenomic profiles. A number of challenges, e.g., instability, 
      specificity, and sensitivity, in lipidomics have to be faced and overcome before 
      clinical application. The association of lipidomics data with gene expression and 
      sequencing of lipid-specific proteins/enzymes should be furthermore clarified. 
      Therefore, clinical lipidomics is expected to be more stable during handling, 
      sensitive in response to changes, specific for diseases, efficient in data 
      analyses, and standardized in measurements, in order to meet clinical needs. 
      Clinical lipidomics will become a more important approach in clinical 
      applications and will be the part of "natural" measures for early diagnosis and 
      progress of disease. Thus, clinical lipidomics will be one of the most powerful 
      approaches for disease-specific diagnosis and therapy, once the mystery of 
      lipidomic profiles and metabolic enzymes is deciphered.

AB  - Phenolic compounds ingestion has been shown to have potential preventive and 
      therapeutic effects against various metabolic diseases such as obesity and 
      cancer. To provide a better understanding of these potential benefit effects, we 
      investigated the metabolic alterations in urine and feces of rat ingested ferulic 
      acid (FA) and quercetin (Qu) using NMR-based metabolomics approach. Our results 
      suggested that dietary FA and/or Qu significantly decreased short chain fatty 
      acids and elevated oligosaccharides in the feces, implying that dietary FA and Qu 
      may modulate gut microbial community with inhibition of bacterial fermentation of 
      dietary fibers. We also found that dietary FA and/or Qu regulated several host 
      metabolic pathways including TCA cycle and energy metabolism, bile acid, amino 
      acid, and nucleic acid metabolism. These biological effects suggest that FA and 
      Qu display outstanding bioavailability and bioactivity and could be used for 
      treatment of some metabolic syndromes, such as inflammatory bowel diseases and 
      obesity.

TI  - Colon Ascendens Stent Peritonitis (CASP) Induces Excessive Inflammation and 
      Systemic Metabolic Dysfunction in a Septic Rat Model.
PG  - 680-688

AB  - The colon ascendens stent peritonitis (CASP) surgery induces a leakage of gut 
      contents, causing polymicrobial sepsis related to post-operative multiple organ 
      failure and death in surgical patient. To evaluate the effects of CASP on 
      multiple organs, we analyzed the systemic metabolic consequences in liver, 
      kidney, lung, and heart of rats after CASP by employing a combination of 
      metabolomics, clinical chemistry, and biological assays. We found that CASP 
      surgery after 18 h resulted in striking elevations of lipid, amino acids, 
      acetate, choline, PC, and GPC in rat liver together with significant depletion of 
      glucose and glycogen. Marked elevations of organic acids including lactate, 
      acetate, and creatine and amino acids accompanied by decline of glucose, betaine, 
      TMAO, choline metabolites (PC and GPC) nucleotides, and a range of organic 
      osmolytes such as myo-inositol are observed in the kidney of 18 h post-operative 
      rat. Furthermore, 18 h post-operative rats exhibited accumulations of lipid, 
      amino acids, and depletions of taurine, myo-inositol, choline, PC, and GPC and 
      some nucleotides including uridine, inosine, and adenosine in the lung. In 
      addition, significant elevations of some amino acids, uracil, betaine, and 
      choline metabolites, together with depletion of inosine-5'-monophosphate, were 
      only observed in the heart of 18 h post-operative rats. These results provide new 
      insights into pathological consequences of CASP surgery, which are important for 
      timely prognosis of sepsis.

AB  - Females have an overall advantage over males in resisting Gram-negative 
      bacteremias, thus hinting at sexual dimorphism of immunity during infections. 
      Here, through intravital microscopy, we observed a sex-biased difference in the 
      capture of blood-borne bacteria by liver macrophages, a process that is critical 
      for the clearance of systemic infections. Complement opsonization was 
      indispensable for the capture of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) in male 
      mice; however, a faster complement component 3-independent process involving 
      abundant preexisting antibodies to EPEC was detected in female mice. These 
      antibodies were elicited predominantly in female mice at puberty in response to 
      estrogen regardless of microbiota-colonization conditions. Estrogen-driven 
      antibodies were maternally transferrable to offspring and conferred protection 
      during infancy. These antibodies were conserved in humans and recognized 
      specialized oligosaccharides integrated into the bacterial lipopolysaccharide and 
      capsule. Thus, an estrogen-driven, innate antibody-mediated immunological 
      strategy conferred protection to females and their offspring.

AB  - This article reviews recent advances in applying natural language processing 
      (NLP) to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for computational phenotyping. 
      NLP-based computational phenotyping has numerous applications including diagnosis 
      categorization, novel phenotype discovery, clinical trial screening, 
      pharmacogenomics, drug-drug interaction (DDI), and adverse drug event (ADE) 
      detection, as well as genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies. 
      Significant progress has been made in algorithm development and resource 
      construction for computational phenotyping. Among the surveyed methods, 
      well-designed keyword search and rule-based systems often achieve good 
      performance. However, the construction of keyword and rule lists requires 
      significant manual effort, which is difficult to scale. Supervised machine 
      learning models have been favored because they are capable of acquiring both 
      classification patterns and structures from data. Recently, deep learning and 
      unsupervised learning have received growing attention, with the former favored 
      for its performance and the latter for its ability to find novel phenotypes. 
      Integrating heterogeneous data sources have become increasingly important and 
      have shown promise in improving model performance. Often, better performance is 
      achieved by combining multiple modalities of information. Despite these many 
      advances, challenges and opportunities remain for NLP-based computational 
      phenotyping, including better model interpretability and generalizability, and 
      proper characterization of feature relations in clinical narratives.

AB  - Selective pressure may drive neural systems to process as much information as 
      possible with the lowest energy cost. Recent experiment evidence revealed that 
      the ratio between synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I) in local cortex is 
      generally maintained at a certain value which may influence the efficiency of 
      energy consumption and information transmission of neural networks. To understand 
      this issue deeply, we constructed a typical recurrent Hodgkin-Huxley network 
      model and studied the general principles that governs the relationship among the 
      E/I synaptic current ratio, the energy cost and total amount of information 
      transmission. We observed in such a network that there exists an optimal E/I 
      synaptic current ratio in the network by which the information transmission 
      achieves the maximum with relatively low energy cost. The coding energy 
      efficiency which is defined as the mutual information divided by the energy cost, 
      achieved the maximum with the balanced synaptic current. Although background 
      noise degrades information transmission and imposes an additional energy cost, we 
      find an optimal noise intensity that yields the largest information transmission 
      and energy efficiency at this optimal E/I synaptic transmission ratio. The 
      maximization of energy efficiency also requires a certain part of energy cost 
      associated with spontaneous spiking and synaptic activities. We further proved 
      this finding with analytical solution based on the response function of bistable 
      neurons, and demonstrated that optimal net synaptic currents are capable of 
      maximizing both the mutual information and energy efficiency. These results 
      revealed that the development of E/I synaptic current balance could lead a 
      cortical network to operate at a highly efficient information transmission rate 
      at a relatively low energy cost. The generality of neuronal models and the 
      recurrent network configuration used here suggest that the existence of an 
      optimal E/I cell ratio for highly efficient energy costs and information 
      maximization is a potential principle for cortical circuit networks. SUMMARY: We 
      conducted numerical simulations and mathematical analysis to examine the energy 
      efficiency of neural information transmission in a recurrent network as a 
      function of the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections. We 
      obtained a general solution showing that there exists an optimal E/I synaptic 
      ratio in a recurrent network at which the information transmission as well as the 
      energy efficiency of this network achieves a global maximum. These results 
      reflect general mechanisms for sensory coding processes, which may give insight 
      into the energy efficiency of neural communication and coding.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No large-scale studies have specifically evaluated the outcomes of 
      infantile spasms (IS) of unknown cause, previously known as cryptogenic or 
      idiopathic. The Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project aimed to characterize IS of 
      unknown cause by phenotype and genotype analysis. METHODS: We undertook a 
      retrospective multicenter observational cohort of 133 individuals within the 
      Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project database met criteria for IS of unknown cause 
      with at least six months of follow-up data. Clinical medical records, imaging, 
      and electroencephalography were examined. RESULTS: Normal development occurred in 
      only 15% of IS of unknown cause. The majority (85%) had clinically documented 
      developmental delay (15% mild, 20% moderate, and 50% severe) at last assessment 
      (median 2.7 years; interquartile interval 1.71-6.25 years). Predictors of 
      positive developmental outcomes included no delay prior to IS (P < 0.001), older 
      age of IS onset (median six months old), and resolution of IS after initial 
      treatment (P < 0.001). Additional seizures after IS occurred in 67%, with 
      predictors being seizures prior to IS (P = 0.018), earlier age of IS onset 
      (median five months old), and refractory IS (P = 0.008). On a research basis, 
      whole exome sequencing identified 15% with de novo variants in known epilepsy 
      genes. Individuals with a genetic finding were more likely to have poor 
      developmental outcomes (P = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The current study highlights the 
      predominately unfavorable developmental outcomes and that subsequent seizures are 
      common in children with IS of unknown cause. Ongoing genetic evaluation of IS of

      Next-Generation Sequencing Data.

AB  - Analyzing copy number variations (CNVs) from next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
      data has become a common approach to detect disease susceptibility genes. The 
      main challenge is how to utilize the NGS data with limited coverage depth to 
      detect significant CNVs. Here, we introduce a new statistical method, the 
      derivative of correlation coefficient (DCC), to detect significant CNVs that 
      recurrently occur in multiple samples using read depth signals. We use a sliding 
      window to calculate a correlation coefficient for each genome bin, and compute 
      corresponding derivatives by fitting curves to the correlation coefficient. Then, 
      the detection of significant CNVs was transformed into a problem of detecting 
      significant derivatives reflecting genome breakpoints that can be solved using 
      statistical hypothesis testing. We tested and compared the performance of DCC 
      against several peer methods using a large number of simulation data sets, and 
      validated DCC using several real sequencing data sets derived from the European 
      Genome-Phenome archive, DNA Data Bank of Japan, and the 1000 Genomes Project. 
      Experimental results suggest that DCC is an effective approach for identifying 
      CNVs, outperforming peer methods in the terms of detection power and accuracy. 
      DCC can be used to detect significant or recurrent CNVs in various NGS data sets, 
      thus providing useful information to study genomic mutations and find disease 
      susceptibility genes.

TI  - A SNP panel for identification of DNA and RNA specimens.
PG  - 90
LID - 10.1186/s12864-018-4482-7 [doi]
LID - 90
AB  - BACKGROUND: SNP panels that uniquely identify an individual are useful for 
      genetic and forensic research. Previously recommended SNP panels are based on DNA 
      profiles and mostly contain intragenic SNPs. With the increasing interest in RNA 
      expression profiles, we aimed for establishing a SNP panel for both DNA and 
      RNA-based genotyping. RESULTS: To determine a small set of SNPs with maximally 
      discriminative power, genotype calls were obtained from DNA and blood-derived RNA 
      sequencing data belonging to healthy, geographically dispersed, Dutch 
      individuals. SNPs were selected based on different criteria like genotype call 
      rate, minor allele frequency, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage 
      disequilibrium. A panel of 50 SNPs was sufficient to identify an individual 
      uniquely: the probability of identity was 6.9 × 10(- 20) when assuming no family 
      relations and 1.2 × 10(- 10) when accounting for the presence of full sibs. The 
      ability of the SNP panel to uniquely identify individuals on DNA and RNA level 
      was validated in an independent population dataset. The panel is applicable to 
      individuals from European descent, with slightly lower power in non-Europeans. 
      Whereas most of the genes containing the 50 SNPs are expressed in various 
      tissues, our SNP panel needs optimization for other tissues than blood. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This first DNA/RNA SNP panel will be useful to identify sample 
      mix-ups in biomedical research and for assigning DNA and RNA stains in crime 
      scenes to unique individuals.

LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-7747-5_2 [doi]
AB  - Root crown phenotyping allows measuring many parameters that describe the top 
      portion of crop root systems and can be used for the basis of genome-wide 
      association studies, QTL analysis, and physiology studies. Root crown phenotyping 
      is a relatively simple process, with the major steps being excavation, transport, 
      soil removal, and measurements. On the other hand, all steps require substantial 
      manual labor and occur outside in challenging environments, and many factors 
      influence the ultimate success of applying this methodology to research 
      questions. Here, general guidance is given for how to optimize root crown 
      phenotyping for unique research questions, and specific protocols are given for 
      acquiring images of root crowns of three crop species: maize, wheat, and soybean.

TI  - Substance use disorder and associated factors among prisoners in a correctional 
      institution in Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 314

LID - 314
AB  - BACKGROUND: Substance use disorder is an important public health problem and one 
      of the major causes of disability worldwide. Substance use and criminal behavior 
      are closely related and there is a significant association between substance 
      misuse and crime, but little is known about substance use disorder among 
      prisoners, in particular in low-income countries. Therefore, we investigated 
      substance use disorder and associated factors in inmates of a correctional 
      institution in Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional 
      study design to collect data from 336 prisoners from June 5 to July 5, 2017. 
      Study participants were selected from the total of 1460 prisoners eligible for 
      the study by a systematic random sampling technique, i.e., one participant was 
      randomly selected from every four consecutive admissions in the registration 
      book. Alcohol use disorder, nicotine dependence, khat abuse, cannabis use 
      disorder, psychopathy, adverse traumatic life events, and social support were 
      assessed. Data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed in bivariate 
      and multivariable logistic regression models with the Statistical Package for 
      Social Science version 21. Variables with a P value < 0.05 in the final fitting 
      model were declared to be associated with the outcome variable. RESULTS: The 
      overall prevalence of substance use disorder was 55.9%. The prevalence of khat 
      abuse was 41.9%; alcohol use disorder, 36.2%; nicotine dependence, 19.8%; and 
      cannabis use disorder, 3.6%. Poor social support, living in urban areas, 
      psychopathy, and a family history of substance use were positively associated 
      with substance use disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Substance use disorder is prevalent 
      among prisoners. The increased morbidity and unpleasant psychosocial consequences 
      associated with substance use disorder, together with our finding that 66.3% of 
      prisoners with substance use disorder were interested in obtaining treatment, 
      suggest a need to establish prison-based treatment in this correctional 
      institution in Jimma.

TI  - Learning Opportunities for Drug Repositioning via GWAS and PheWAS Findings.
PG  - 237-246
AB  - Drug repositioning for available medications can be preferred over traditional 
      drug development, which requires substantially more effort to uncover new 
      insights into medications and diseases. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) 
      and Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) are two complimentary methods for 
      finding novel associations between genes and diseases. We hypothesize that 
      discoveries from these studies could be leveraged to find new targets for 
      existing drugs. Thus, we propose a framework to learn opportunities for inferring 
      such relationships via overlapped genes between disease-associated genes (e.g. 
      GWAS and PheWAS findings) and drugtargeted genes. We use drug indications found 
      in Medication Indication Resource (MEDI) as a gold standard to evaluate if drug 
      indications learned from GWAS and PheWAS findings have clinical indications. We 
      examined 151,011 <drug, GWAS phenotype> pairs from 987 drugs across 153 diseases 
      and 763 pairs were statistically significant. Out of these 763 pairs, 16 of them 
      were found to have clinical indications.

TI  - Salinity tolerance in Australian wild Oryza species varies widely and matches 
      that observed in O. sativa.
PG  - 66
LID - 10.1186/s12284-018-0257-7 [doi]
LID - 66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Soil salinity is widespread in rice-producing areas globally, 
      restricting both vegetative growth and grain yield. Attempts to improve the salt 
      tolerance of Asian rice, Oryza sativa-the most salt sensitive of the major cereal 
      crops-have met with limited success, due to the complexity of the trait and 
      finite variation in salt responses among O. sativa lines. Naturally occurring 
      variation among the more than 20 wild species of the Oryza genus has great 
      potential to provide breeders with novel genes to improve resistance to salt. 
      Here, through two distinct screening experiments, we investigated variation in 
      salinity tolerance among accessions of two wild rice species endemic to 
      Australia, O. meridionalis and O. australiensis, with O. sativa cultivars Pokkali 
      and IR29 providing salt-tolerant and sensitive controls, respectively. RESULTS: 
      Rice plants were grown on soil supplemented with field-relevant concentrations of 
      NaCl (0, 40, 80, and 100 mM) for 30 d, a period sufficient to reveal differences 
      in growth and physiological traits. Two complementary screening approaches were 
      used: destructive phenotyping and high-throughput image-based phenotyping. All 
      genotypes displayed clear responses to salt treatment. In the first experiment, 
      both salt-tolerant Pokkali and an O. australiensis accession (Oa-VR) showed the 
      least reduction in biomass accumulation, SES score and chlorophyll content in 
      response to salinity. Average shoot Na(+)/K(+) values of these plants were the 
      lowest among the genotypes tested. In the second experiment, plant responses to 
      different levels of salt stress were quantified over time based on projected 
      shoot area calculated from visible red-green-blue (RGB) and fluorescence images. 
      Pokkali grew significantly faster than the other genotypes. Pokkali and Oa-VR 
      plants displayed the same absolute growth rate under 80 and 100 mM, while Oa-D 
      grew significantly slower with the same treatments. Oa-VR showed substantially 
      less inhibition of growth in response to salinity when compared with Oa-D. 
      Senescence was seen in Oa-D after 30 d treatment with 40 mM NaCl, while the 
      putatively salt-tolerant Oa-VR had only minor leaf damage, even at higher salt 
      treatments, with less than a 40% increase in relative senescence at 100 mM NaCl 
      compared to 120% for Oa-VR. CONCLUSION: The combination of our two screening 
      experiments uncovered striking levels of salt tolerance diversity among the 
      Australian wild rice accessions tested and enabled analysis of their growth 
      responses to a range of salt levels. Our results validate image-based phenotyping 
      as a valuable tool for quantitative measurement of plant responses to abiotic 
      stresses. They also highlight the potential of exotic germplasm to provide new 
      genetic variation for salinity tolerance in rice.

TI  - Genetic diversity of root system architecture in response to drought stress in 
      grain legumes.
PG  - 3267-3277
LID - 10.1093/jxb/ery082 [doi]
AB  - Climate change has increased the occurrence of extreme weather patterns globally, 
      causing significant reductions in crop production, and hence threatening food 
      security. In order to meet the food demand of the growing world population, a 
      faster rate of genetic gains leading to productivity enhancement for major crops 
      is required. Grain legumes are an essential commodity in optimal human diets and 
      animal feed because of their unique nutritional composition. Currently, limited 
      water is a major constraint in grain legume production. Root system architecture 
      (RSA) is an important developmental and agronomic trait, which plays vital roles 
      in plant adaptation and productivity under water-limited environments. A deep and 
      proliferative root system helps extract sufficient water and nutrients under 
      these stress conditions. The integrated genetics and genomics approach to dissect 
      molecular processes from genome to phenome is key to achieve increased water 
      capture and use efficiency through developing better root systems. Success in 
      crop improvement under drought depends on discovery and utilization of genetic 
      variations existing in the germplasm. In this review, we summarize current 
      progress in the genetic diversity in major legume crops, quantitative trait loci 
      (QTLs) associated with RSA, and the importance and applications of recent 
      discoveries associated with the beneficial root traits towards better RSA for 
      enhanced drought tolerance and yield.

AB  - In GAW20, we investigated the association of specific genetic regions of interest 
      (ROIs) with log-transformed triglyceride (TG) levels following lipid-lowering 
      medication using epigenetic and genetic markers. The goal was to incorporate 
      kernels for cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) markers and compare the kernels to a 
      purely parametric model. Post-treatment TG levels were investigated for 
      post-methylation data at CpG sites and region-specific SNPs and adjusted for 
      pre-treatment TG levels and age, in independent individuals only (real data: 
      n = 150; simulated data, replicate 84: n = 111). In both data sets, our 
      single-CpG-marker results using kernels and linear regression were in good 
      agreement. In the real data, we investigated the introns of the CPT1A gene 
      previously reported as associated with TG levels as separate ROIs, and were able 
      to find hints of an association of cg17058475 and cg00574958 with post-treatment 
      TG levels. In the simulated data, we investigated a total of 10 regions, in which 
      the 5 causal and 5 non-causal markers lie, respectively, with increased 
      methylation variances, yielding plausible results for the 3 window sizes. 
      Overall, this indicates that kernels for CpG markers are feasible. An interaction 
      regression model for the causal SNP with the nearest CpG marker identified an 
      effect for the SNPs with the three greatest heritabilities simulated. The 
      simulation model assumed full SNP effect only for unmethylated regions decreasing 
      to zero in the case of full methylation. Thus, in the context of a clear 
      candidate setting, interaction between epigenetic and genetic data may enhance 
      information, albeit nominally, even with small sample sizes. Relieving the burden 
      of multiple testing, developing kernels further to analyze data from multiple 
      omics jointly is well warranted.

TI  - Imputation-Based Whole-Genome Sequence Association Study Reveals Constant and 
      Novel Loci for Hematological Traits in a Large-Scale Swine F(2) Resource 
      Population.

AB  - The whole-genome sequences of progenies with low-density single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) genotypes can be imputed with high accuracy based on the 
      deep-coverage sequences of key ancestors. With this imputation technology, a more 
      powerful genome-wide association study (GWAS) can be carried out using imputed 
      whole-genome variants and the phenotypes of interest to overcome the shortcomings 
      of low-power detection and the large confidence interval derived from low-density 
      SNP markers in classic association studies. In this study, 19 ancestors of a 
      large-scale swine F(2) White Duroc × Erhualian population were deeply sequenced 
      for their genome with an average coverage of 25×. Considering 98 pigs from 10 
      different breeds with high-quality deep sequenced genomes, we imputed the whole 
      genomic variants of 1020 F(2) pigs genotyped by the PorcineSNP60 BeadChip with 
      high accuracy and obtained 14,851,440 sequence variants after quality control. 
      Based on this, 87 novel quantitative traits loci (QTLs) for 18 hematological 
      traits at three different physiological stages of the F(2) pigs were identified, 
      among which most of the novel QTLs have been repeated in two of the three stages. 
      Literature mining pinpointed that the FGF14 and LCLAT1 genes at SSC11 and SSC3 
      may affect the MCH at day 240 and MCV at day 18, respectively. The present study 
      shows that combining high-quality imputed genomic variants and correlated 
      phenomic traits into GWAS can improve the capability to detect QTL considerably. 
      The large number of different QTLs for hematological traits identified at 
      multiple growth stages implies the complexity and time specificity of these 
      traits.

AB  - With the help of high-throughput NGS (next-generation sequencing) technologies, 
      ancestral transcriptome reconstruction is helpful to understand the complexity of 
      transcriptional regulatory systems that underlies the evolution of multiple 
      cellular metazoans with sophisticated functions and distinctive morphologies. To 
      this end, we report a new method of ancestral state inference. The new method 
      used Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model, which is more biologically realistic, to 
      replace the Brownian motion (BM) model and is suitable for multi-transcriptome 
      data. Implemented in the free R package, AnceTran is specially designed for 
      RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, which is feasible. It should be noticed that our work 
      will be integrated to a unified, statistically-sound phylogenetic framework to 
      study the evolution of many other molecular phenomes such as proteomics, 
      chromatin accessibility, methylation status, and metabolomics. We exemplify our 
      method by a case study, using the ChIP-seq binding data of three liver-specific 
      transcription factors and the RNA-seq liver expression data in four closely 
      related mice species, and some technical issues are discussed.

TI  - Hypoxic-stabilized EPAS1 proteins transactivate DNMT1 and cause promoter 
      hypermethylation and transcription inhibition of EPAS1 in non-small cell lung 
      cancer.
PG  - fj201700715

AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality 
      globally. Although cigarette smoking is by far the most important risk factor for 
      lung cancer, the aberrant expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes 
      contributes a great deal to tumorigenesis. Here, we reveal that aberrant 
      expression of endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1 ( EPAS1) gene, which 
      encodes hypoxia inducible factor 2α, has a critical role in NSCLC. Our results 
      showed EPAS1 mRNA was down-regulated in 82.5% of NSCLC tissues, and a new region 
      of EPAS1 promoter was found to be highly methylated in lung cancer cell lines and 
      NSCLC tissues. Moreover, the methylation rates were negatively correlated to 
      EPAS1 mRNA expression in lung tissues. Further, demethylation analysis 
      demonstrated EPAS1 was regulated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in NSCLC. In 
      contrast, DNMT1 was verified as an EPAS1 target gene by chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation assay and could be transactivated by stabilized EPAS1 
      proteins in hypoxic lung cells, thereby decreasing EPAS1 mRNA expression by 
      methylation regulation. Collectively, our study suggests there might be a 
      mechanism of negative-feedback regulation for EPAS1 in NSCLC. That is, 
      hypoxic-stabilized EPAS1 proteins transactivated DNMT1, which further promoted 
      the hypermethylation of EPAS1 promoter and decreased EPAS1 mRNA expression levels 
      in NSCLC.-Xu, X.-H., Bao, Y., Wang, X., Yan, F., Guo, S., Ma, Y., Xu, D., Jin,

AB  - Our understanding of complex gene regulatory networks have been improved by the 
      discovery of ncRNA-ncRNA crosstalk in normal and disease-specific physiological 
      conditions. Previous studies have proposed numerous approaches for constructing 
      ncRNA-ncRNA networks via ncRNA-mRNA regulation, functional information, or 
      phenomics alone, or by combining heterogeneous data. Furthermore, it has been 
      shown that ncRNA-ncRNA crosstalk can be rewired in different tissues or specific 
      diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate transcriptome data to construct 
      context-specific ncRNA-ncRNA networks. In this chapter, we elucidated the 
      commonly used ncRNA-ncRNA network modeling methods, and highlighted the need to 
      integrate heterogeneous multi-mics data. Finally, we suggest future directions 
      for studies of ncRNAs crosstalk. This comprehensive description and discussion 
      elucidated in this chapter will provide constructive insights into ncRNA-ncRNA 
      crosstalk.

AB  - Hair plays an important role in primates and is clearly subject to adaptive 
      selection. While humans have lost most facial hair, eyebrows are a notable 
      exception. Eyebrow thickness is heritable and widely believed to be subject to 
      sexual selection. Nevertheless, few genomic studies have explored its genetic 
      basis. Here, we performed a genome-wide scan for eyebrow thickness in 2961 Han 
      Chinese. We identified two new loci of genome-wide significance, at 3q26.33 near 
      SOX2 (rs1345417: P = 6.51×10(-10)) and at 5q13.2 near FOXD1 (rs12651896: P = 
      1.73×10(-8)). We further replicated our findings in the Uyghurs, a population 
      from China characterized by East Asian-European admixture (N = 721), the CANDELA 
      cohort from five Latin American countries (N = 2301), and the Rotterdam Study 
      cohort of Dutch Europeans (N = 4411). A meta-analysis combining the full GWAS 
      results from the three cohorts of full or partial Asian descent (Han Chinese, 
      Uyghur and Latin Americans, N = 5983) highlighted a third signal of genome-wide 
      significance at 2q12.3 (rs1866188: P = 5.81×10(-11)) near EDAR. We performed 
      fine-mapping and prioritized four variants for further experimental verification. 
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing provided evidence that rs1345417 and rs12651896 
      affect the transcriptional activity of the nearby SOX2 and FOXD1 genes, which are 
      both involved in hair development. Finally, suitable statistical analyses 
      revealed that none of the associated variants showed clear signals of selection 
      in any of the populations tested. Contrary to popular speculation, we found no 
      evidence that eyebrow thickness is subject to strong selective pressure.

TI  - Optimizing soil-coring strategies to quantify root-length-density distribution in 
      field-grown maize: virtual coring trials using 3-D root architecture models.
PG  - 809-819
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcx117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Root distribution has a major influence on soil exploration 
      and nutrient and water acquisition by plants. Soil coring is a well-known way to 
      estimate root distribution. However, identifying an optimal core-sampling 
      strategy is important if one is to strike the right balance between the high cost 
      of making field estimates of root length density (RLD) vs. the need for accurate 
      estimates. Virtual assessment of competing soil-coring strategies, based on 
      three-dimensional (3-D) models of root system architecture (RSA), is a highly 
      effective way to find that balance. METHODS: The trajectories of the axile roots 
      of two maize cultivars having contrasting axile root angles were measured in the 
      field using in situ 3-D digitization. Lateral roots were also measured by 
      recording topological and geometrical parameters. Based on the measurement 
      dataset obtained, contrasting 3-D RSA models of individual maize plants were 
      constructed in which the different lateral rooting angles were represented. Using 
      these RSA models the accuracies of various core-sampling strategies for 
      estimating RLD were assessed in a series of virtual experiments. KEY RESULTS: 
      Substantial biases occur if a one-core sampling strategy is used to estimate RLD. 
      The biases largely remain for two-core sampling, although a weighting method can 
      reduce these. However, given that identification of an optimal weighting method 
      is difficult in practice, a new sampling strategy is proposed based on an 
      area-weighting algorithm. In this way low deviations in RLD estimation can be 
      achieved by sampling between rows and also by using larger-diameter (7.5 or 10 
      cm) cores. CONCLUSIONS: A 3-D root architecture model based on a detailed 
      measurement dataset provides an ideal platform for assessing a range of 
      soil-coring strategies. The improved two-core sampling strategy, based on an 
      area-weighting algorithm, shows considerable promise as a cost-efficient way of 
      obtaining good quality RLD estimates for maize.

TI  - RhizoChamber-Monitor: a robotic platform and software enabling characterization 
      of root growth.
PG  - 44

LID - 44
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to efficiently determine genotypic differences in rooting 
      patterns of crops, novel hardware and software are needed simultaneously to 
      characterize dynamics of root development. RESULTS: We describe a prototype 
      robotic monitoring platform-the RhizoChamber-Monitor for analyzing growth 
      patterns of plant roots automatically. The RhizoChamber-Monitor comprises an 
      automatic imaging system for acquiring sequential images of roots which grow on a 
      cloth substrate in custom rhizoboxes, an automatic irrigation system and a 
      flexible shading arrangement. A customized image processing software was 
      developed to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of root growth from time-course 
      images of multiple plants. This software can quantify overall growth of roots and 
      extract detailed growth traits (e.g. dynamics of length and diameter) of primary 
      roots and of individual lateral roots automatically. It can also identify local 
      growth traits of lateral roots (pseudo-mean-length and pseudo-maximum-length) 
      semi-automatically. Two cotton genotypes were used to test both the physical 
      platform and the analysis software. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of hardware and 
      software is expected to facilitate quantification of root geometry and its 
      spatio-temporal growth patterns, and therefore to provide opportunities for 
      high-throughput root phenotyping in support of crop breeding to optimize root 
      architecture.

PG  - 668-681
LID - 10.1038/s41588-018-0090-3 [doi]
AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common illness accompanied by considerable 
      morbidity, mortality, costs, and heightened risk of suicide. We conducted a 
      genome-wide association meta-analysis based in 135,458 cases and 344,901 controls 
      and identified 44 independent and significant loci. The genetic findings were 
      associated with clinical features of major depression and implicated brain 
      regions exhibiting anatomical differences in cases. Targets of antidepressant 
      medications and genes involved in gene splicing were enriched for smaller 
      association signal. We found important relationships of genetic risk for major 
      depression with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: lower 
      educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal, whereas major 
      depression and schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All 
      humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for major 
      depression. These findings help refine the basis of major depression and imply 
      that a continuous measure of risk underlies the clinical phenotype.

AB  - The combination of electronic health records (EHRs) with genetic data has ushered 
      in the next wave of complex disease genetics. Population-based biobanks and other 
      large cohorts provide sufficient sample sizes to identify novel genetic 
      associations across the hundreds to thousands of phenotypes gleaned from EHRs. In 
      this review, we summarize the current state of these EHR-linked biobanks, explore 
      ongoing methods development in the field and highlight recent discoveries of 
      genetic associations. We enumerate the many existing biobanks with EHRs linked to 
      genetic data, many of which are available to researchers via application and 
      contain sample sizes >50 000. We also discuss the computational and statistical 
      considerations for analysis of such large datasets including mixed models, 
      phenotype curation and cloud computing. Finally, we demonstrate how genome-wide 
      association studies and phenome-wide association studies have identified novel 
      genetic findings for complex diseases, specifically cardiometabolic traits. As 
      more researchers employ innovative hypotheses and analysis approaches to study 
      EHR-linked biobanks, we anticipate a richer understanding of the genetic etiology 
      of complex diseases.

TI  - Patient-Centered Precision Health In A Learning Health Care System: Geisinger's 
      Genomic Medicine Experience.
PG  - 757-764
LID - 10.1377/hlthaff.2017.1557 [doi]
AB  - Health care delivery is increasingly influenced by the emerging concepts of 
      precision health and the learning health care system. Although not synonymous 
      with precision health, genomics is a key enabler of individualized care. 
      Delivering patient-centered, genomics-informed care based on individual-level 
      data in the current national landscape of health care delivery is a daunting 
      challenge. Problems to overcome include data generation, analysis, storage, and 
      transfer; knowledge management and representation for patients and providers at 
      the point of care; process management; and outcomes definition, collection, and 
      analysis. Development, testing, and implementation of a genomics-informed program 
      requires multidisciplinary collaboration and building the concepts of precision 
      health into a multilevel implementation framework. Using the principles of a 
      learning health care system provides a promising solution. This article describes 
      the implementation of population-based genomic medicine in an integrated learning 
      health care system-a working example of a precision health program.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A neurobiologically informed, system-specific psychopathological 
      approach has been suggested for use in schizophrenia. However, to our knowledge, 
      such an approach has not been used to prospectively describe the course of 
      schizophrenia. SAMPLING AND METHODS: We assessed psychopathology in a 
      well-described sample of 100 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective 
      disorder with the Bern Psychopathology Scale (BPS) at 6-month intervals for up to 
      18 months. The BPS groups symptoms into the 3 domains language, affectivity and 
      motor behaviour; each domain is rated as being normal, inhibited or disinhibited. 
      In addition, we collected qualitative psychopathological data in the form of case 
      reports. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients completed at least 2 assessments over the 
      course of at least 1 year. Of these, 16 patients (33.3%) showed a bipolar course 
      pattern (i.e., a switch from inhibited to disinhibited or vice versa) in 1 domain 
      and 6 patients (12.5%) in more than 1 domain. Shifts from 1 dominant domain to 
      another were seen frequently (n = 20, 41.7%), but shifts between 1 dominant 
      domain and a combination of dominant domains were more common (n = 33, 68.8%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The course of schizophrenia is heterogeneous and shows frequent 
      changes in psychopathology. This should be taken into account in the 
      communication with patients and in the research on underlying illness mechanisms 
      and treatment. A major limitation of this study is the small sample size.

TI  - Severe clinical events in 100 patients with schizophrenia: a retrospective 
      clinical description using a system-specific psychopathological approach.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1080/08039488.2017.1368701 [doi]
AB  - Catatonic states and numerous other severe clinical events can complicate the 
      course of schizophrenia. Whether these severe courses are associated with 
      particular system-specific symptom dimensions remain unclear. Aim is to assess 
      the frequency of severe clinical events in a clinical population and to 
      investigate the association of these events with sociodemographic data and 
      system-specific psychopathology, combining qualitative and quantitative data. We 
      performed a comprehensive retrospective description of a well-described and 
      geographically stable sample of 100 patients with schizophrenia or 
      schizoaffective disorder and linked severe clinical events with sociodemographic 
      data at inclusion into the study (as indicators of social functioning) and 
      symptoms at first admission, classified with the Bern Psychopathology Scale 
      (BPS). We found 12 mentions of catatonic stupor or excitement, 45 of suicide 
      attempts, 26 of suicidality, 18 of deliberate self-harm, 18 of self-threatening 
      behaviour other than deliberate self-harm, 34 of violence against other persons, 
      18 of violence against objects and six of sexual harassment. Disinhibited 
      language on first admission seemed to be a protective factor against suicidality 
      and disinhibited motor behaviour seemed to predict self-threatening and violent 
      behaviour. Catatonia and violence in particular seemed to be socially disabling. 
      This exploratory study showed that the BPS is a promising instrument and might 
      represent a system-specific approach in identifying patients at risk for severe 
      sequelae of schizophrenia. This will have to be tested in future prospective 
      studies.

TI  - α-Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone Attenuates Neovascularization by Inducing Nitric 
      Oxide Deficiency via MC-Rs/PKA/NF-κB Signaling.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19123823 [doi]
LID - 3823
AB  - α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) has been characterized as a novel 
      angiogenesis inhibitor. The homeostasis of nitric oxide (NO) plays an important 
      role in neovascularization. However, it remains unclear whether α-MSH mitigates 
      angiogenesis through modulation of NO and its signaling pathway. The present 
      study elucidated the function and mechanism of NO signaling in α-MSH-induced 
      angiogenesis inhibition using cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
      (HUVECs), rat aorta rings, and transgenic zebrafish. By Griess reagent assay, it 
      was found α-MSH dose-dependently reduced the NO release in HUVECs. Immunoblotting 
      and immunofluorescence analysis revealed α-MSH potently suppressed endothelial 
      and inducible nitric oxide synthase (eNOS/iNOS) expression, which was accompanied 
      with inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activities. Excessive supply of 
      NO donor l-arginine reversed the α-MSH-induced angiogenesis inhibition in vitro 
      and in vivo. By using antibody neutralization and RNA interference, it was 
      delineated that melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R) and melanocortin-2 receptor 
      (MC2-R) participated in α-MSH-induced inhibition of NO production and 
      NF-κB/eNOS/iNOS signaling. This was supported by pharmaceutical inhibition of 
      protein kinase A (PKA), the downstream effector of MC-Rs signaling, using H89 
      abolished the α-MSH-mediated suppression of NO release and eNOS/iNOS protein 
      level. Therefore, α-MSH exerts anti-angiogenic function by perturbing NO 
      bioavailability and eNOS/iNOS expression in endothelial cells.

TI  - LPA Variants Are Associated With Residual Cardiovascular Risk in Patients 
      Receiving Statins.
PG  - 1839-1849
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031356 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death globally. 
      Although therapy with statins decreases circulating levels of low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol and the incidence of CHD, additional events occur despite 
      statin therapy in some individuals. The genetic determinants of this residual 
      cardiovascular risk remain unknown. METHODS: We performed a 2-stage genome-wide 
      association study of CHD events during statin therapy. We first identified 3099 
      cases who experienced CHD events (defined as acute myocardial infarction or the 
      need for coronary revascularization) during statin therapy and 7681 controls 
      without CHD events during comparable intensity and duration of statin therapy 
      from 4 sites in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network. We then 
      sought replication of candidate variants in another 160 cases and 1112 controls 
      from a fifth Electronic Medical Records and Genomics site, which joined the 
      network after the initial genome-wide association study. Finally, we performed a 
      phenome-wide association study for other traits linked to the most significant 
      locus. RESULTS: The meta-analysis identified 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms at 
      a genome-wide level of significance within the LPA/PLG locus associated with CHD 
      events on statin treatment. The most significant association was for an intronic 
      single nucleotide polymorphism within LPA/PLG (rs10455872; minor allele 
      frequency, 0.069; odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-1.86; 
      P=2.6×10(-)(10)). In the replication cohort, rs10455872 was also associated with 
      CHD events (odds ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.57; P=0.009). The 
      association of this single nucleotide polymorphism with CHD events was 
      independent of statin-induced change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (odds 
      ratio, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-2.24; P=0.004) and persisted in 
      individuals with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≤70 mg/dL (odds ratio, 2.43; 
      95% confidence interval, 1.18-4.75; P=0.015). A phenome-wide association study 
      supported the effect of this region on coronary heart disease and did not 
      identify noncardiovascular phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variations at the LPA 
      locus are associated with CHD events during statin therapy independently of the 
      extent of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. This finding provides 
      support for exploring strategies targeting circulating concentrations of 
      lipoprotein(a) to reduce CHD events in patients receiving statins.

TI  - Position-specific intron retention is mediated by the histone methyltransferase 
      SDG725.
PG  - 44

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intron retention (IR), the most prevalent alternative splicing form 
      in plants, plays a critical role in gene expression during plant development and 
      stress response. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IR regulation 
      remain largely unknown. RESULTS: Knockdown of SDG725, a histone H3 lysine 36 
      (H3K36)-specific methyltransferase in rice, leads to alterations of IR in more 
      than 4700 genes. Surprisingly, IR events are globally increased at the 5' region 
      but decreased at the 3' region of the gene body in the SDG725-knockdown mutant. 
      Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses reveal that SDG725 depletion 
      results in a genome-wide increase of the H3K36 mono-methylation (H3K36me1) but, 
      unexpectedly, promoter-proximal shifts of H3K36 di- and tri-methylation (H3K36me2 
      and H3K36me3). Consistent with the results in animals, the levels of 
      H3K36me1/me2/me3 in rice positively correlate with gene expression levels, 
      whereas shifts of H3K36me2/me3 coincide with position-specific alterations of IR. 
      We find that either H3K36me2 or H3K36me3 alone contributes to the positional 
      change of IR caused by SDG725 knockdown, although IR shift is more significant 
      when both H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 modifications are simultaneously shifted. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that SDG725 modulates IR in a position-specific 
      manner, indicating that H3K36 methylation plays a role in RNA splicing, probably 
      by marking the retained introns in plants.

TI  - Void spot assay procedural optimization and software for rapid and objective 
      quantification of rodent voiding function, including overlapping urine spots.
PG  - F1067-F1080
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00245.2018 [doi]
AB  - Mouse urinary behavior is quantifiable and is used to pinpoint mechanisms of 
      voiding dysfunction and evaluate potential human therapies. Approaches to 
      evaluate mouse urinary function vary widely among laboratories, however, 
      complicating cross-study comparisons. Here, we describe development and 
      multi-institutional validation of a new tool for objective, consistent, and rapid 
      analysis of mouse void spot assay (VSA) data. Void Whizzard is a freely available 
      software plugin for FIJI (a distribution of ImageJ) that facilitates VSA image 
      batch processing and data extraction. We describe its features, demonstrate them 
      by evaluating how specific VSA method parameters influence voiding behavior, and 
      establish Void Whizzard as an expedited method for VSA analysis. This study 
      includes control and obese diabetic mice as models of urinary dysfunction to 
      increase rigor and ensure relevance across distinct voiding patterns. In 
      particular, we show that Void Whizzard is an effective tool for quantifying 
      nonconcentric overlapping void spots, which commonly confound analyses. We also 
      show that mouse genetics are consistently more influential than assay design 
      parameters when it comes to VSA outcomes. None of the following procedural 
      modifications to reduce overlapping spots masked these genetic-related 
      differences: reduction of VSA testing duration, water access during the assay 
      period, placement of a wire mesh cage bottom on top of or elevated over the 
      filter paper, treatment of mesh with a hydrophobic spray, and size of wire mesh 
      opening. The Void Whizzard software and rigorous validation of VSA methodological 
      parameters described here advance the goal of standardizing mouse urinary 
      phenotyping for comprehensive urinary phenome analyses.

AB  - As a circadian organ, liver executes diverse functions in different phase of the 
      circadian clock. This process is believed to be driven by a transcription 
      program. Here, we present a transcription factor (TF) DNA-binding 
      activity-centered multi-dimensional proteomics landscape of the mouse liver, 
      which includes DNA-binding profiles of different TFs, phosphorylation, and 
      ubiquitylation patterns, the nuclear sub-proteome, the whole proteome as well as 
      the transcriptome, to portray the hierarchical circadian clock network of this 
      tissue. The TF DNA-binding activity indicates diurnal oscillation in four major 
      pathways, namely the immune response, glucose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, 
      and the cell cycle. We also isolate the mouse liver Kupffer cells and measure 
      their proteomes during the circadian cycle to reveal a cell-type resolved 
      circadian clock. These comprehensive data sets provide a rich data resource for 
      the understanding of mouse hepatic physiology around the circadian clock.

TI  - Nuclear Norm Clustering: a promising alternative method for clustering tasks.
PG  - 10873

AB  - Clustering techniques are widely used in many applications. The goal of 
      clustering is to identify patterns or groups of similar objects within a dataset 
      of interest. However, many cluster methods are neither robust nor sensitive to 
      noises and outliers in real data. In this paper, we present Nuclear Norm 
      Clustering (NNC, available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/nnc/), an 
      algorithm that can be used in various fields as a promising alternative to the 
      k-means clustering method. The NNC algorithm requires users to provide a data 
      matrix M and a desired number of cluster K. We employed simulated annealing 
      techniques to choose an optimal label vector that minimizes nuclear norm of the 
      pooled within cluster residual matrix. To evaluate the performance of the NNC 
      algorithm, we compared the performance of both 15 public datasets and 2 
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on psoriasis, comparing our method with 
      other classic methods. The results indicate that NNC method has a competitive 
      performance in terms of F-score on 15 benchmarked public datasets and 2 psoriasis 
      GWAS datasets. So NNC is a promising alternative method for clustering tasks.

AB  - GourdBase is an integrative data platform for the bottle gourd to examine its 
      multifarious intuitive morphology and annotated genome. GourdBase consists of six 
      main modules that store and interlink multi-omic data: the genome (with 
      transcriptomic data integrated) module, the phenome module, the markers/QTLs 
      module, the maps (genetic, physical and comparative) module, the cultivars 
      module, and the publications module. These modules provide access to various type 
      of data including the annotated reference genome sequence, gene models, 
      transcriptomic data from various tissues, physical and comparative genome maps, 
      molecular markers in different types, phenotypic data for featuring traits 
      including fruit shape and umami taste, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that 
      underlie these traits. GourdBase is intuitive, user-friendly and interlinked and 
      is designed to allow researchers, breeders and trained farmers to browse, search 
      and fetch information on interests and assist in genomics-driven studies and 
      breeding. The knowledge base and web interface can be accessed at

AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the use of ontology-based semantic mapping 
      (OS-Mapping) in chemical toxicity assessment. Nineteen chemical-species 
      phenotypic profiles (CSPPs) were constructed by ontologically annotating the 
      toxicity responses reported in more than seven hundred published studies of ten 
      chemicals on six vertebrate species. The CSPPs were semantically compared to more 
      than 29,000 publicly available phenotypic profiles of genes, KEGG (Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways, and diseases based on a 
      cross-species phenotype ontology. OS-Mapping was shown to differentiate chemical 
      toxicities among themselves as well as within and across species. It also 
      revealed cases of chemical by species interactions. In addition to confirming 
      similar MOAs (mechanisms of action) for a few chemicals, OS-Mapping also 
      generated novel insights into the MOAs underlying some seemingly different, yet 
      phenotypically similar, classes of chemicals. The nature of a unified 
      cross-species phenotype ontology and its representation of diverse knowledge 
      domains allowed the construction of a complete phenotypic continuum for the 
      17α-ethynylestradiol_fathead minnow across the biological levels of organization, 
      which complemented a similar one derived from the Comparative Toxicogenomics 
      Database but based primarily on 17α-ethynylestradiol-induced molecular 
      phenotypes. Overall, OS-Mapping has been demonstrated to offer a powerful 
      approach to help bridge the gap between the molecular and non-molecular 
      phenotypes of chemicals characterized by using high throughput or traditional 
      omics methods and their apical endpoints of greater regulatory relevance, which 
      are typically phenotypes found at the higher levels of biological organization. 
      OS-Mapping also enables comparative toxicity assessment among chemicals, both 
      within and across species. Furthermore, the semantic analysis of phenotypes can 
      reveal additional novel MOAs for some well-known chemicals and discover candidate 
      MOAs for chemicals that are less molecularly characterized. A full phenotypic 
      continuum based on OS-Mapping will also be conducive to the future development of 
      adverse outcome pathways. As phenomics continues to advance and the ontological 
      annotation of literature becomes more automated, the power of OS-Mapping will be 
      further enhanced.

TI  - Interspecies Developmental Differences in Metabonomic Phenotypes of Lycium

AB  - Fruits of Lycium ruthenicum (LR) and L. barbarum (LB) in Solanaceae family 
      contain abundant bioactive metabolites used widely as functional food and natural 
      medicine. To characterize the fruit developmental molecular phenotypes, we 
      comprehensively analyzed metabolite composition of both Lycium fruits at three 
      developmental stages using the combined NMR, liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry, and gas chromatography-flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry 
      methods. The metabonomes of these fruits were dominated by over 90 metabolites 
      including sugars, amino acids, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, 
      fatty acids, choline metabolites, and shikimate-mediated plant secondary 
      metabolites. Metabolic phenotypes of two species differed significantly at all 
      three developmental stages; LB fruits contained significantly more sugars and 
      amino acids but less TCA cycle intermediates, fatty acids, and secondary 
      metabolites than LR. Interspecies differences for fatty acid levels were much 
      greater after color-breaking than precolor-breaking. Furthermore, LR fruits 
      contained more osmolytes than LB fruits indicating different osmoregulation 
      requirements for these fruits during development. Significant differences were 
      also present in biosynthesis of shikimate-mediated plant secondary metabolites in 
      LR and LB. These findings provided essential metabolic information for plant 
      physiology of these  Lycium species and their utilizations demonstrating the 
      usefulness of this metabonomic phenotyping approach for studying fundamental 
      biochemistry of the plant development.

AB  - Pathogens have been a strong driving force for natural selection. Therefore, 
      understanding how human genetic differences impact infection-related cellular 
      traits can mechanistically link genetic variation to disease susceptibility. Here 
      we report the Hi-HOST Phenome Project (H2P2): a catalog of cellular genome-wide 
      association studies (GWAS) comprising 79 infection-related phenotypes in response 
      to 8 pathogens in 528 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Seventeen loci surpass 
      genome-wide significance for infection-associated phenotypes ranging from 
      pathogen replication to cytokine production. We combined H2P2 with clinical 
      association data from patients to identify a SNP near CXCL10 as a risk factor for 
      inflammatory bowel disease. A SNP in the transcriptional repressor ZBTB20 
      demonstrated pleiotropy, likely through suppression of multiple target genes, and 
      was associated with viral hepatitis. These data are available on a web portal to 
      facilitate interpreting human genome variation through the lens of cell biology 
      and should serve as a rich resource for the research community.

TI  - Physiological, hematological and biochemical factors associated with 
      high-altitude headache in young Chinese males following acute exposure at 3700 m.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High-altitude headache (HAH) is the most common sickness occurred in 
      healthy people after rapid ascending to high altitude, and its risk factors were 
      still not well understood. To investigate physiological, hematological and 
      biochemical risk factors associated with high-altitude headache (HAH) after acute 
      exposure to 3700 m, we conducted a two-stage, perspective observational study. In 
      72 h, total 318 young Han Chinese males ascended from sea level (altitude of 
      50 m) to altitude of 3700 m by train. Demographic data, physiological, 
      hematological and biochemical parameters of all participants were collected 
      within one week prior to the departure, and within 24 h after arrival. RESULTS: 
      The incidence of HAH was 74.84%. For parameters measured at sea level, 
      participants with HAH exhibited significantly higher age and lower BUN 
      (p < 0.05). For parameters measured at 3700 m, participants with HAH exhibited 
      significantly lower blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), higher resting heart rate 
      (HR), higher systolic blood pressure at resting (SBP) and lower blood urea 
      nitrogen (BUN) (all p < 0.05). At 3700 m, the severity of HAH associated with 
      SpO(2), HR and BUN significantly (all p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression 
      revealed that for parameters at sea level, BUN was associated with HAH [BUN 
      (OR:0.77, 95% CI:0.60-0.99)] and for parameters at 3700 m, SpO(2), HR and BUN 
      were associated with HAH independently [SpO(2) (OR:0.84, 95% CI:0.76-0.93); HR 
      (OR:1.03, 95% CI:1.00-1.07); BUN (OR:0.64, 95% CI:0.46-0.88)]. No association 
      between hematological parameters and HAH was observed. CONCLUSION: We confirmed 
      that higher HR, lower SpO(2) are independent risk factors for HAH. Furthermore, 
      we found that at both 50 m and 3700 m, lower BUN is a novel independent risk 
      factor for HAH, providing new insights for understanding the pathological 
      mechanisms.

AB  - A multi-omics quantitative integrative analysis of lignin biosynthesis can 
      advance the strategic engineering of wood for timber, pulp, and biofuels. Lignin 
      is polymerized from three monomers (monolignols) produced by a grid-like pathway. 
      The pathway in wood formation of Populus trichocarpa has at least 21 genes, 
      encoding enzymes that mediate 37 reactions on 24 metabolites, leading to lignin 
      and affecting wood properties. We perturb these 21 pathway genes and integrate 
      transcriptomic, proteomic, fluxomic and phenomic data from 221 lines selected 
      from ~2000 transgenics (6-month-old). The integrative analysis estimates how 
      changing expression of pathway gene or gene combination affects protein 
      abundance, metabolic-flux, metabolite concentrations, and 25 wood traits, 
      including lignin, tree-growth, density, strength, and saccharification. The 
      analysis then predicts improvements in any of these 25 traits individually or in 
      combinations, through engineering expression of specific monolignol genes. The 
      analysis may lead to greater understanding of other pathways for improved growth 
      and adaptation.

AB  - Botrytis cinerea, which causes gray mold, is an important pathogen in four 
      important economic crops, tomato, tobacco, cucumber and strawberry, in China and 
      worldwide. Metabolic phenomics data on B. cinerea isolates from these four crops 
      were characterized and compared for 950 phenotypes with a BIOLOG Phenotype 
      MicroArray (PM). The results showed that the metabolic fingerprints of the four 
      B. cinerea isolates were similar to each other with minimal differences. B. 
      cinerea isolates all metabolized more than 17% of the tested carbon sources, 63% 
      of the amino acid nitrogen substrates, 80% of the peptide nitrogen substrates, 
      93% of the phosphorus substrates, and 97% of the sulfur substrates. Carbon 
      substrates of organic acids and carbohydrates, and nitrogen substrates of amino 
      acids and peptides were the significant utilization patterns for B. cinerea. Each 
      B. cinerea isolate contained 94 biosynthetic pathways. These isolates showed a 
      large range of adaptabilities and were still able to metabolize substrates in the 
      presence of the osmolytes, including up to 6% potassium chloride, 10% sodium 
      chloride, 5% sodium sulfate, 6% sodium formate, 20% ethylene glycol, and 3% urea. 
      These isolates all showed active metabolism in environments with pH values from 
      3.5 to 8.5 and exhibited decarboxylase activities. These characterizations 
      provide a theoretical basis for the study of B. cinerea in biochemistry and 
      metabolic phenomics and provide valuable clues to finding potential new ways to 
      manage gray mold.

TI  - Sclerostin vaccination mitigates estrogen deficiency induction of bone mass loss 
      and microstructure deterioration.

AB  - Sclerostin (SOST) is a Wnt signaling inhibitor detrimental to osteogenic 
      differentiation and bone mineral acquisition. While control of SOST action delays 
      the pathogenesis of skeletal disorders, the effects of SOST vaccination on the 
      estrogen deficiency-induced bone deterioration remain elusive. In this study, we 
      generated a SOST-Fc fusion protein which was composed of a SOST peptide 
      Pro-Asn-Ala-Ile-Gly along with an IgG Fc fragment. SOST-Fc vaccination increased 
      serum anti-SOST antibody levels and reduced serum SOST concentrations in mice. In 
      vitro, anti-SOST serum attenuated the SOST-induced inhibition of osteogenic gene 
      expression in osteoblast cultures. Administration with SOST-Fc increased serum 
      levels of bone formation marker osteocalcin and alleviated the ovariectomy 
      escalation of serum resorption markers CTX-1 and TRAP5b concentrations. It 
      remarkably lessened the estrogen deficiency-mediated deterioration of bone 
      mineral density, morphometric characteristics of trabecular bone, and mechanical 
      strength of femurs and lumbar spines. The SOST-Fc-treated skeletal tissue 
      exhibited moderate responses to the adverse actions of ovariectomy to bone 
      mineral accretion, osteoclast surface, trabecular separation, and fatty marrow 
      histopathology. SOST-Fc treatment increased serum osteoclast-inhibitory factor 
      osteoprotegrin levels in conjunction with strong Wnt3a, β-catenin, and TCF4 
      immunostaining in osteoblasts, whereas it weakened the estrogen deficiency 
      enhancement of osteoclast-promoting factor receptor activator of nuclear 
      factor-κB ligand. Taken together, blockade of SOST action by SOST-Fc vaccination 
      sustains Wnt signaling, which harmonizes bone mineral accretion and resorption 
      reactions and thereby ameliorates ovariectomy-induced bone loss. This study 
      highlights SOST-Fc fusion protein as a new molecular therapeutic potential for 
      preventing from osteoporotic disorders.

AB  - DNA methylation-based biomarkers were suggested to be promising for early cancer 
      diagnosis. However, DNA methylation-based biomarkers for esophageal squamous cell 
      carcinoma (ESCC), especially in Chinese Han populations have not been identified 
      and evaluated quantitatively. Candidate tumor suppressor genes (N = 65) were 
      selected through literature searching and four public high-throughput DNA 
      methylation microarray datasets including 136 samples totally were collected for 
      initial confirmation. Targeted bisulfite sequencing was applied in an independent 
      cohort of 94 pairs of ESCC and normal tissues from a Chinese Han population for 
      eventual validation. We applied nine different classification algorithms for the 
      prediction to evaluate to the prediction performance. ADHFE1, EOMES, SALL1 and 
      TFPI2 were identified and validated in the ESCC samples from a Chinese Han 
      population. All four candidate regions were validated to be significantly 
      hyper-methylated in ESCC samples through Wilcoxon rank-sum test (ADHFE1, P = 1.7 
      × 10(-3); EOMES, P = 2.9 × 10(-9); SALL1, P = 3.9 × 10(-7); TFPI2, p = 3.4 × 
      10(-6)). Logistic regression based prediction model shown a moderately ESCC 
      classification performance (Sensitivity = 66%, Specificity = 87%, AUC = 0.81). 
      Moreover, advanced classification method had better performances (random forest 
      and naive Bayes). Interestingly, the diagnostic performance could be improved in 
      non-alcohol use subgroup (AUC = 0.84). In conclusion, our data demonstrate the 
      methylation panel of ADHFE1, EOMES, SALL1 and TFPI2 could be an effective 
      methylation-based diagnostic assay for ESCC.

AB  - To understand the impact of genome sequence variation (the genotype) responsible 
      for biological diversity and human health (the phenotype) including cystic 
      fibrosis and Alzheimer's disease, we developed a Gaussian-process-based machine 
      learning (ML) approach, variation spatial profiling (VSP). VSP uses a sparse 
      collection of known variants found in the population that perturb the protein 
      fold to define unknown variant function based on the emergent general principle 
      of spatial covariance (SCV). SCV quantitatively captures the role of proximity in 
      genotype-to-phenotype spatial-temporal relationships. Phenotype landscapes 
      generated through SCV provide a platform that can be used to describe the 
      functional properties that drive sequence-to-function-to-structure design of the 
      polypeptide fold at atomic resolution. We provide proof of principle that SCV can 
      enable the use of population-based genomic platforms to define the origins and 
      mechanism of action of genotype-to-phenotype transformations contributing to the 
      health and disease of an individual.

TI  - Bipolar disorders.
PG  - 18008
LID - 10.1038/nrdp.2018.8 [doi]
AB  - Bipolar disorders are chronic and recurrent disorders that affect >1% of the 
      global population. Bipolar disorders are leading causes of disability in young 
      people as they can lead to cognitive and functional impairment and increased 
      mortality, particularly from suicide and cardiovascular disease. Psychiatric and 
      nonpsychiatric medical comorbidities are common in patients and might also 
      contribute to increased mortality. Bipolar disorders are some of the most 
      heritable psychiatric disorders, although a model with gene-environment 
      interactions is believed to best explain the aetiology. Early and accurate 
      diagnosis is difficult in clinical practice as the onset of bipolar disorder is 
      commonly characterized by nonspecific symptoms, mood lability or a depressive 
      episode, which can be similar in presentation to unipolar depression. Moreover, 
      patients and their families do not always understand the significance of their 
      symptoms, especially with hypomanic or manic symptoms. As specific biomarkers for 
      bipolar disorders are not yet available, careful clinical assessment remains the 
      cornerstone of diagnosis. The detection of hypomanic symptoms and longtudinal 
      clinical assessment are crucial to differentiate a bipolar disorder from other 
      conditions. Optimal early treatment of patients with evidence-based medication 
      (typically mood stabilizers and antipsychotics) and psychosocial strategies is 
      necessary.

AB  - The DrugBank database consists of ~800 genes that are well characterized drug 
      targets. This list of genes is a useful resource for association testing. For 
      example, loss of function (LOF) genetic variation has the potential to mimic the 
      effect of drugs, and high impact variation in these genes can impact downstream 
      traits. Identifying novel associations between genetic variation in these genes 
      and a range of diseases can also uncover new uses for the drugs that target these 
      genes. Phenome Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) have been successful in 
      identifying genetic associations across hundreds of thousands of diseases. We 
      have conducted a novel gene based PheWAS to test the effect of rare variants in 
      DrugBank genes, evaluating associations between these genes and more than 500 
      quantitative and dichotomous phenotypes. We used whole exome sequencing data from 
      38,568 samples in Geisinger MyCode Community Health Initiative. We evaluated the 
      results of this study when binning rare variants using various filters based on 
      potential functional impact. We identified multiple novel associations, and the 
      majority of the significant associations were driven by functionally annotated 
      variation. Overall, this study provides a sweeping exploration of rare variant 
      associations within functionally relevant genes across a wide range of diagnoses.

AB  - Phenome-wide association studies (PheWASs) have been a useful tool for testing 
      associations between genetic variations and multiple complex traits or diagnoses. 
      Linking PheWAS-based associations between phenotypes and a variant or a genomic 
      region into a network provides a new way to investigate cross-phenotype 
      associations, and it might broaden the understanding of genetic architecture that 
      exists between diagnoses, genes, and pleiotropy. We created a network of 
      associations from one of the largest PheWASs on electronic health record 
      (EHR)-derived phenotypes across 38,682 unrelated samples from the Geisinger's 
      biobank; the samples were genotyped through the DiscovEHR project. We computed 
      associations between 632,574 common variants and 541 diagnosis codes. Using these 
      associations, we constructed a "disease-disease" network (DDN) wherein pairs of 
      diseases were connected on the basis of shared associations with a given genetic 
      variant. The DDN provides a landscape of intra-connections within the same 
      disease classes, as well as inter-connections across disease classes. We 
      identified clusters of diseases with known biological connections, such as 
      autoimmune disorders (type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple 
      sclerosis) and cardiovascular disorders. Previously unreported relationships 
      between multiple diseases were identified on the basis of genetic associations as 
      well. The network approach applied in this study can be used to uncover 
      interactions between diseases as a result of their shared, potentially 
      pleiotropic SNPs. Additionally, this approach might advance clinical research and 
      even clinical practice by accelerating our understanding of disease mechanisms on 
      the basis of similar underlying genetic associations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) are a high-throughput 
      approach to evaluate comprehensive associations between genetic variants and a 
      wide range of phenotypic measures. PheWAS has varying sample sizes for 
      quantitative traits, and variable numbers of cases and controls for binary traits 
      across the many phenotypes of interest, which can affect the statistical power to 
      detect associations. The motivation of this study is to investigate the various 
      parameters which affect the estimation of statistical power in PheWAS, including 
      sample size, case-control ratio, minor allele frequency, and disease penetrance. 
      RESULTS: We performed a PheWAS simulation study, where we investigated variations 
      in statistical power based on different parameters, such as overall sample size, 
      number of cases, case-control ratio, minor allele frequency, and disease 
      penetrance. The simulation was performed on both binary and quantitative 
      phenotypic measures. Our simulation on binary traits suggests that the number of 
      cases has more impact on statistical power than the case to control ratio; also, 
      we found that a sample size of 200 cases or more maintains the statistical power 
      to identify associations for common variants. For quantitative traits, a sample 
      size of 1000 or more individuals performed best in the power calculations. We 
      focused on common genetic variants (MAF > 0.01) in this study; however, in future 
      studies, we will be extending this effort to perform similar simulations on rare 
      variants. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a series of PheWAS simulation analyses 
      that can be used to estimate statistical power for some potential scenarios. 
      These results can be used to provide guidelines for appropriate study design for 
      future PheWAS analyses.

AB  - Most phenome-wide association studies (PheWASs) to date have used a small to 
      moderate number of SNPs for association with phenotypic data. We performed a 
      large-scale single-cohort PheWAS, using electronic health record (EHR)-derived 
      case-control status for 541 diagnoses using International Classification of 
      Disease version 9 (ICD-9) codes and 25 median clinical laboratory measures. 
      We calculated associations between these diagnoses and traits with ∼630,000 
      common frequency SNPs with minor allele frequency > 0.01 for 38,662 individuals. 
      In this landscape PheWAS, we explored results within diseases and traits, 
      comparing results to those previously reported in genome-wide association studies 
      (GWASs), as well as previously published PheWASs. We further leveraged the 
      context of functional impact from protein-coding to regulatory regions, providing 
      a deeper interpretation of these associations. The comprehensive nature of this 
      PheWAS allows for novel hypothesis generation, the identification of phenotypes 
      for further study for future phenotypic algorithm development, and identification 
      of cross-phenotype associations.

      biology in agronomy.

AB  - Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have resulted in a tremendous 
      increase in the amount of omics data produced in plant science. This increase, in 
      conjunction with the heterogeneity and variability of the data, presents a major 
      challenge to adopt an integrative research approach. We are facing an urgent need 
      to effectively integrate and assimilate complementary datasets to understand the 
      biological system as a whole. The Semantic Web offers technologies for the 
      integration of heterogeneous data and their transformation into explicit 
      knowledge thanks to ontologies. We have developed the Agronomic Linked Data 
      (AgroLD- www.agrold.org), a knowledge-based system relying on Semantic Web 
      technologies and exploiting standard domain ontologies, to integrate data about 
      plant species of high interest for the plant science community e.g., rice, wheat, 
      arabidopsis. We present some integration results of the project, which initially 
      focused on genomics, proteomics and phenomics. AgroLD is now an RDF (Resource 
      Description Format) knowledge base of 100M triples created by annotating and 
      integrating more than 50 datasets coming from 10 data sources-such as Gramene.org 
      and TropGeneDB-with 10 ontologies-such as the Gene Ontology and Plant Trait 
      Ontology. Our evaluation results show users appreciate the multiple query modes 
      which support different use cases. AgroLD's objective is to offer a domain 
      specific knowledge platform to solve complex biological and agronomical questions 
      related to the implication of genes/proteins in, for instances, plant disease 
      resistance or high yield traits. We expect the resolution of these questions to 
      facilitate the formulation of new scientific hypotheses to be validated with a 
      knowledge-oriented approach.

TI  - Genetics of platelet traits in ischaemic stroke: focus on mean platelet volume 
      and platelet count.
PG  - 511-522
LID - 10.1080/00207454.2018.1538991 [doi]
AB  - Purpose/Aim of the study: The aim of this review is to summarize the role of 
      genetic variants affecting mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet count (PLT) 
      leading to higher platelet reactivity and in turn to thrombotic events like 
      stroke and cardiovascular diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search was conducted 
      in PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PROQUEST, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, and 
      Google Scholar related to the studies focussing on genome-wide association 
      studies (GWAS), whole exome sequencing (WES), whole genome sequencing (WGS), 
      phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) and multi-omic analysis that have been 
      employed to identify the genetic variants influencing MPV and PLT. RESULTS: 
      Antiplatelet agents underscore the crucial role of platelets in the pathogenesis 
      of stroke. Higher platelet reactivity in terms of mean platelet volume (MPV) and 
      platelet count (PLT) contributes significantly to the interindividual variation 
      in platelet reaction at the site of vessel wall injury. Some individuals 
      encounter thrombotic events as platelets get occluded at the site of vessel wall 
      injury whereas others heal the injury without occluding the circulation. Evidence 
      suggests that MPV and PLT have a strong genetic component. High throughput 
      techniques including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), whole exome 
      sequencing (WES), whole genome sequencing (WGS), phenome-wide association studies 
      (PheWAS) and multi-omic analysis have identified different genetic variants 
      influencing MPV and PLT. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of complex genetic cross 
      talks affecting PLT and MPV might help to develop novel treatment strategies in 
      treating neurovascular diseases like stroke.

TI  - Accelerating genetic gains in legumes for the development of prosperous 
      smallholder agriculture: integrating genomics, phenotyping, systems modelling and 
      agronomy.
PG  - 3293-3312

AB  - Grain legumes form an important component of the human diet, provide feed for 
      livestock, and replenish soil fertility through biological nitrogen fixation. 
      Globally, the demand for food legumes is increasing as they complement cereals in 
      protein requirements and possess a high percentage of digestible protein. Climate 
      change has enhanced the frequency and intensity of drought stress, posing serious 
      production constraints, especially in rainfed regions where most legumes are 
      produced. Genetic improvement of legumes, like other crops, is mostly based on 
      pedigree and performance-based selection over the past half century. To achieve 
      faster genetic gains in legumes in rainfed conditions, this review proposes the 
      integration of modern genomics approaches, high throughput phenomics, and 
      simulation modelling in support of crop improvement that leads to improved 
      varieties that perform with appropriate agronomy. Selection intensity, generation 
      interval, and improved operational efficiencies in breeding are expected to 
      further enhance the genetic gain in experimental plots. Improved seed access to 
      farmers, combined with appropriate agronomic packages in farmers' fields, will 
      deliver higher genetic gains. Enhanced genetic gains, including not only 
      productivity but also nutritional and market traits, will increase the 
      profitability of farming and the availability of affordable nutritious food 
      especially in developing countries.

TI  - Cupriavidus metallidurans Strains with Different Mobilomes and from Distinct 
      Environments Have Comparable Phenomes.
LID - 10.3390/genes9100507 [doi]
LID - 507
AB  - Cupriavidus metallidurans has been mostly studied because of its resistance to 
      numerous heavy metals and is increasingly being recovered from other environments 
      not typified by metal contamination. They host a large and diverse mobile gene 
      pool, next to their native megaplasmids. Here, we used comparative genomics and 
      global metabolic comparison to assess the impact of the mobilome on growth 
      capabilities, nutrient utilization, and sensitivity to chemicals of type strain 
      CH34 and three isolates (NA1, NA4 and H1130). The latter were isolated from water 
      sources aboard the International Space Station (NA1 and NA4) and from an invasive 
      human infection (H1130). The mobilome was expanded as prophages were predicted in 
      NA4 and H1130, and a genomic island putatively involved in abietane diterpenoids 
      metabolism was identified in H1130. An active CRISPR-Cas system was identified in 
      strain NA4, providing immunity to a plasmid that integrated in CH34 and NA1. No 
      correlation between the mobilome and isolation environment was found. In 
      addition, our comparison indicated that the metal resistance determinants and 
      properties are conserved among these strains and thus maintained in these 
      environments. Furthermore, all strains were highly resistant to a wide variety of 
      chemicals, much broader than metals. Only minor differences were observed in the 
      phenomes (measured by phenotype microarrays), despite the large difference in 
      mobilomes and the variable (shared by two or three strains) and strain-specific 
      genomes.

AB  - Obstructive cholestasis causes liver injury via accumulation of toxic bile acids 
      (BAs). Therapeutic options for cholestatic liver disease are limited, partially 
      because the available murine disease models lack translational value. Profiling 
      of time-related changes following bile duct ligation (BDL) in Gold Syrian 
      hamsters revealed a biochemical response similar to cholestatic patients in terms 
      of BA pool composition, alterations in hepatocyte BA transport and signaling, 
      suppression of BA production, and adapted BA metabolism. Hamsters tolerated 
      cholestasis well for up to 28days and progressed relatively slowly to fibrotic 
      liver injury. Hepatocellular necrosis was absent, which coincided with preserved 
      intrahepatic energy levels and only mild oxidative stress. The histological 
      response to cholestasis in hamsters was similar to the changes seen in 17 
      patients with prolonged obstructive cholestasis caused by cholangiocarcinoma. 
      Hamsters moreover upregulated hepatic fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15) 
      expression in response to BDL, which is a cytoprotective adaptation to 
      cholestasis that hitherto had only been documented in cholestatic human livers. 
      Hamster models should therefore be added to the repertoire of animal models used 
      to study the pathophysiology of cholestatic liver disease.

AB  - Cancer is responsible for an extraordinary burden of disease, affecting 90.5 
      million people worldwide in 2015. Outcomes for these patients are improved when 
      the disease is diagnosed at an early, or even precancerous, stage. Raman 
      spectroscopy is demonstrating results that show its ability to detect the 
      molecular changes that are diagnostic of precancerous and cancerous tissue. This 
      review highlights the new advances occurring in this domain. Areas covered: 
      PubMed searches were undertaken to identify new research in the utilisation of 
      Raman spectroscopy in cancer diagnostics. The areas in which Raman spectroscopy 
      is showing promise are covered, including improving the accuracy of identifying 
      precancerous changes, using the technology in real time, in vivo modalities, the 
      search for a biomarker to aid potential screening and predicting the response of 
      the cancer to the treatment regimen. Expert commentary: Many of the examples in 
      this review are focused on Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma as 
      this is my area of expertise and perfectly exemplifies where Raman spectroscopy 
      could be utilised in clinical practise. The authors discuss the areas where they 
      believe current knowledge is lacking and how Raman spectroscopy could answer the 
      dilemmas that are still faced in the management of cancer.

TI  - Large Scale Phenotyping Provides Insight into the Diversity of Vegetative and 
      Reproductive Organs in a Wide Collection of Wild and Domesticated Peppers 
      (Capsicum spp.).
LID - 10.3390/plants7040103 [doi]
LID - 103
AB  - In the past years, the diversity of Capsicum has been mainly investigated through 
      genetics and genomics approaches, fewer efforts have been made in the field of 
      plant phenomics. Assessment of crop traits with high-throughput methodologies 
      could enhance the knowledge of the plant phenome, giving at the same time a key 
      contribution to the understanding of the function of many genes. In this study, a 
      wide germplasm collection of 307 accessions retrieved from 48 world regions, and 
      belonging to nine Capsicum species was characterized for 54 plant, leaf, flower 
      and fruit traits. Conventional descriptors and semi-automated tools based on 
      image analysis and colour coordinate detection were used. Significant differences 
      were found among accessions, between species and between sweet and spicy 
      cultivated types, revealing a large diversity. The results highlighted how the 
      domestication process and the continued selection have increased the variability 
      of fruit shape and colour. Hierarchical clustering based on conventional and 
      fruit morphological descriptors reflected the separation of species on the basis 
      of their phylogenetic relationships. These observations suggested that the flow 
      between distinct gene pools could have contributed to determine the similarity of 
      the species on the basis of morphological plant and fruit parameters. The 
      approach used represents the first high-throughput phenotyping effort in Capsicum 
      spp. aimed at broadening the knowledge of the diversity of domesticated and wild 
      peppers. The data could help to select best the candidates for breeding and 
      provide new insight into the understanding of the genetic base of the fruit shape 
      of pepper.

AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Image-based phenomics is a powerful approach to capture and 
      quantify plant diversity. However, commercial platforms that make consistent 
      image acquisition easy are often cost-prohibitive. To make high-throughput 
      phenotyping methods more accessible, low-cost microcomputers and cameras can be 
      used to acquire plant image data. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used low-cost Raspberry 
      Pi computers and cameras to manage and capture plant image data. Detailed here 
      are three different applications of Raspberry Pi-controlled imaging platforms for 
      seed and shoot imaging. Images obtained from each platform were suitable for 
      extracting quantifiable plant traits (e.g., shape, area, height, color) en masse 
      using open-source image processing software such as PlantCV. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      protocol describes three low-cost platforms for image acquisition that are useful 
      for quantifying plant diversity. When coupled with open-source image processing 
      tools, these imaging platforms provide viable low-cost solutions for 
      incorporating high-throughput phenomics into a wide range of research programs.

AB  - We performed a systematic analysis of genes implicated in thigh subcutaneous 
      adipose tissue of Asian Indian Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (AIT2DM) and created a 
      phenome-interactome network. This analysis was performed on 60 subjects specific 
      to limb thigh fat by integrating phenotypic traits and similarity scores 
      associated with AIT2DM. Using a phenotypic attribute, a contextual neighbor was 
      identified across all the traits, viz. body mass index (BMI) statistics, 
      adipocyte size, lipid parameters, homeostatic model assessment- insulin 
      resistance (HOMA-IR), HOMA-ß. In this work, we have attempted to characterize 
      transcription signatures using the phenome-interactome maps where each of the 
      traits under study including the intermediary phenotypes has a distinct set of 
      genes forming the hubs. Furthermore, we have identified various clinical, 
      biochemical, and radiological parameters which show significant correlation with 
      distinct hubs. We observed a number of novel pathways and genes including those 
      that are non-coding RNAs implicated in AIT2DM.We showed that they appear to be 
      associated with pathways, viz. tyrosine kinase JAK2, NOTCH thereby recruiting 
      signaling molecules such as STAT5 and Src family kinases on the cell surface 
      regulated them and our analyses comprising significant hubs suggest that thigh 
      subcutaneous adipose tissue plays a role in pathophysiology of AIT2DM.

PG  - e3000074

LID - e3000074
AB  - Phenomics has the potential to facilitate significant advances in biology but 
      requires the development of high-throughput technologies capable of generating 
      and analysing high-dimensional data. There are significant challenges associated 
      with building such technologies, not least those required for investigating 
      dynamic processes such as embryonic development, during which high rates of 
      temporal, spatial, and functional change are inherently difficult to capture. 
      Here, we present EmbryoPhenomics, an accessible high-throughput platform for 
      phenomics in aquatic embryos comprising an Open-source Video Microscope (OpenVIM) 
      that produces high-resolution videos of multiple embryos under tightly controlled 
      environmental conditions. These videos are then analysed by the Python package 
      Embryo Computer Vision (EmbryoCV), which extracts phenomic data for 
      morphological, physiological, behavioural, and proxy traits during the process of 
      embryonic development. We demonstrate the broad-scale applicability of 
      EmbryoPhenomics in a series of experiments assessing chronic, acute, and 
      multistressor responses to environmental change (temperature and salinity) in >30 
      million images of >600 embryos of two species with markedly different patterns of 
      development-the pond snail Radix balthica and the marine amphipod Orchestia 
      gammarellus. The challenge of phenomics is significant but so too are the 
      rewards, and it is particularly relevant to the urgent task of assessing complex 
      organismal responses to current rates of environmental change. EmbryoPhenomics

AB  - Background: Duodenal atresia (DA) is a congenital obstruction of the duodenum, 
      which affects 1 in 7000 pregnancies and requires major surgery in the 1st days of 
      life. Three morphological DA types are described. In humans, the association 
      between DA and Down syndrome suggests an underlying, albeit elusive, genetic 
      etiology. In mice, interruption of fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) gene 
      signaling results in DA in 30-50% of embryos, supporting a genetic etiology. This 
      study aims to validate the spectrum of DA in two novel strains of Fgf10 knock-out 
      mice, in preparation for future and translational research. Methods: Two novel 
      CRISPR Fgf10 knock-out mouse strains were derived and embryos generated by 
      heterozygous plug-mating. E15.5-E19.5 embryos were genotyped with respect to 
      Fgf10 and micro-dissected to determine the presence and type of DA. Results: One 
      twenty seven embryos (32 wild-type, 34 heterozygous, 61 null) were analyzed. No 
      wild-type or heterozygous embryos had DA. However, 74% of Fgf10 null embryos had 
      DA (49% type 1, 18% type 2, and 33% type 3). Conclusion: Our CRISPR-derived 
      strains showed higher penetrance of DA due to single-gene deletion of Fgf10 in 
      mice than previously reported. Further, the DA type distribution in these mice 
      more closely reiterated that observed in humans. Future experiments will document 
      RNA and protein expression of FGF10 and its key downstream signaling targets in 
      normal and atretic duodenum. This includes exploitation of modern, high-fidelity 
      developmental tools, e.g., Fgf10 (flox/+)-tomato(flox/flox) mice.

TI  - The Physiological Basis of Drought Tolerance in Crop Plants: A Scenario-Dependent 
      Probabilistic Approach.
PG  - 733-759
LID - 10.1146/annurev-arplant-042817-040218 [doi]
AB  - Drought tolerance involves mechanisms operating at different spatial and temporal 
      scales, from rapid stomatal closure to maintenance of crop yield. We review how 
      short-term mechanisms are controlled for stabilizing shoot water potential and 
      how long-term processes have been constrained by evolution or breeding to fit 
      into acclimation strategies for specific drought scenarios. These short- or 
      long-term feedback processes participate in trade-offs between carbon 
      accumulation and the risk of deleterious soil water depletion. Corresponding 
      traits and alleles may therefore have positive or negative effects on crop yield 
      depending on drought scenarios. We propose an approach that analyzes the genetic 
      architecture of traits in phenotyping platforms and of yield in tens of field 
      experiments. A combination of modeling and genomic prediction is then used to 
      estimate the comparative interests of combinations of alleles depending on 
      drought scenarios. Hence, drought tolerance is understood probabilistically by 
      estimating the benefit and risk of each combination of alleles.

TI  - Exploring pathogenesis in subjects with subjective Tinnitus having kidney 
      deficiency pattern in terms of Traditional Chinese Medicine based on serum 
      metabolic profiles.
PG  - 773-780
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the metabolic pathogenesis in subjects with subjective 
      tinnitus (ST) having kidney deficiency pattern (KDP) (ST/KDP) in terms of 
      Traditional Chinese Medicine. METHODS: Three groups of subjects, including 
      healthy individuals, subjects with ST/KDP, and subjects who were healthy 
      initially and then developed ST/KDP one year later (healthy ¡ú ST/KDP), were 
      recruited for this study. Serum metabolic profiles of all subjects were analyzed 
      using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with 
      quadruple-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The metabolic characteristics of the 
      ST/KDP subjects were determined, and the corresponding biomarkers were predicted. 
      The metabolomics data from the healthy ¡ú ST/KDP subjects were collected for 
      further verification. RESULTS: Twelve metabolites in the ST/KDP subjects were 
      different from those of the healthy control subjects. Of these metabolites, 
      according to the prediction, except for octanoic acid, other metabolites might 
      characterize ST/KDP. Ten metabolites at the outcome ST/KDP stage were different 
      from those at the initial (control) stage. Through the comparison of these 
      metabolites with the predicted metabolites, five common metabolites, including 
      upregulated glutamate, serotonin, orotic acid and 8-oxoguanine, as well as 
      downregulated taurine, were found. These common metabolites were significantly 
      associated with canonical pathways including calcium signaling, ¦Ã-aminobutyric 
      acid (GABA) receptor signaling, purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, taurine 
      biosynthesis, and serotonin receptor signaling. CONCLUSION: The metabolic 
      pathogenesis in ST/KDP subjects was characterized by upregulated glutamate, 
      serotonin, orotic acid and 8-oxoguanine, as well as downregulated taurine, 
      additionally, perturbations of calcium signaling, GABA receptor signaling, purine 
      and pyrimidine biosynthesis, taurine biosynthesis, and serotonin receptor 
      signaling.

AB  - Lipids play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. 
      Changes in lipids of erythrocytes are indicative of the outcome of 
      pathophysiological processes. In the present study, we assessed whether the lipid 
      profiles of erythrocytes from heart failure (HF) patients are informative of 
      their disease risk. The lipidomes of erythrocytes from 10 control subjects and 29 
      patients at different HF stages were analyzed using liquid chromatography 
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The lipid composition of erythrocytes obtained 
      from HF patients was significantly different from that of normal controls. The 
      levels of phosphatidylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), and 
      sphingomyelins decreased in HF erythrocytes as compared with those of control 
      subjects; however, the levels of lysoPCs, lysoPEs, and ceramides increased in HF 
      erythrocytes. Notably, the oxidized cholesterol 7-ketocholesterol (7KCh) 
      accumulated to higher level in HF erythrocytes than in plasma from the same 
      patients. We further validated our findings with a cohort of 115 subjects of 
      control subjects (n=28) and patients (n=87). Mechanistically, 7KCh promoted 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in cardiomyocytes; and induced their 
      death, probably through an ATF4-dependent pathway. Our findings suggest that 
      erythrocytic 7KCh can be a risk factor for HF, and is probably implicated in its 
      pathophysiology.

AB  - Accumulated evidence suggests that multiple molecular and cellular interactions 
      promote cancer evolution in vivo. Surgical oncology is of growing significance to 
      a comprehensive understanding of the malignant diseases for therapeutic 
      application. We have analyzed more than 1000 clinical samples from surgically 
      resected tissue to identify molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets for 
      advanced malignancies. Cancer stemness and mitotic instability were then 
      determined as the essential predictors of aggressive phenotype with poor 
      prognosis. Recently, whole genome/exome sequencing showed a mutational landscape 
      underlying phenotype heterogeneity in caners. In addition, integrated genomic, 
      epigenomic, transcriptomic, metabolic, proteomic and phenomic analyses elucidated 
      several molecular subtypes that cluster in liver, pancreatic, biliary, esophageal 
      and gastroenterological cancers. Identification of each molecular subtype is 
      expected to realize the precise medicine targeting subtype-specific molecules; 
      however, there are obstacle limitations to determine matching druggable targets 
      or synthetic lethal interactions. Current breakthroughs in genome editing 
      technology can provide us with unprecedented opportunity to recapitulate 
      subtype-specific pathophysiology in vitro and in vivo. Given a great potential, 
      on-demand editing system can design actionable strategy and revolutionize 
      precision cancer medicine based on surgical oncology.

TI  - Ci-AMBP: a highly conserved member of the microglobulin superfamily of proteinase 
      inhibitors in grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idellus.
PG  - 251-256
LID - 10.1266/ggs.16-00059 [doi]
AB  - A full-length cDNA clone encoding grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) 
      α1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor (Ci-AMBP) was isolated by subtracted 
      differential hybridization screening from a liver cDNA library. The deduced amino 
      acid sequence shared approximately 50% sequence identity with its mammalian 
      counterparts, but more than 90% identity with another fish species. AMBPs are the 
      precursors of the plasma glycoproteins α1-microglobulin (α1m) and bikunin. Both 
      peptide structures and their chromosomal organization were well conserved in 
      Ci-AMBP. The α1m and bikunin polypeptides are separated by the typical 
      tetrapeptide R-A-R-R that provides an endoproteolytic cleavage site for 
      maturation. The genetic organization of domains and functional motifs indicated 
      that Ci-AMBP is a typical member of the lipocalin and Kunitz-type protease 
      inhibitor superfamilies. Expression of the Ci-AMBP gene in different 
      tissues/organs was evaluated using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and, in contrast to 
      the restricted expression in other species, transcripts were detected in a wide 
      range of tissues. The most abundant expression occurred in the secretory organs, 
      which supports the roles of α1m and bikunin in the immune response to diseases 
      and in the stress response.

TI  - Taurine Transporter dEAAT2 is Required for Auditory Transduction in Drosophila.
PG  - 939-950
LID - 10.1007/s12264-018-0255-1 [doi]
AB  - Drosophila dEAAT2, a member of the excitatory amino-acid transporter (EAAT) 
      family, has been described as mediating the high-affinity transport of taurine, 
      which is a free amino-acid abundant in both insects and mammals. However, the 
      role of taurine and its transporter in hearing is not clear. Here, we report that 
      dEAAT2 is required for the larval startle response to sound stimuli. dEAAT2 was 
      found to be enriched in the distal region of chordotonal neurons where sound 
      transduction occurs. The Ca(2+) imaging and electrophysiological results showed 
      that disrupted dEAAT2 expression significantly reduced the response of 
      chordotonal neurons to sound. More importantly, expressing dEAAT2 in the 
      chordotonal neurons rescued these mutant phenotypes. Taken together, these 
      findings indicate a critical role for Drosophila dEAAT2 in sound transduction by 
      chordotonal neurons.

TI  - Effects of Genetic Variants Associated with Familial Hypercholesterolemia on 
      Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol Levels and Cardiovascular Outcomes in the 
      Million Veteran Program.
LID - e002192 [pii]
LID - 10.1161/CIRCGEN.118.002192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by inherited high 
      levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and premature coronary 
      heart disease (CHD). Over a thousand low-frequency variants in LDLR, APOB and 
      PCSK9 have been implicated in FH but few have been examined at the population 
      level. We aim to estimate the phenotypic effects of a subset of FH variants on 
      LDL-C and clinical outcomes among 331,107 multi-ethnic participants. METHODS: We 
      examined the individual and collective association between putatively pathogenic 
      FH variants included on the MVP biobank array and the maximum LDL-C level over an 
      interval of 15 years (maxLDL). We assessed the collective effect on clinical 
      outcomes by leveraging data from 61.7 million clinical encounters. RESULTS: We 
      found 8 out of 16 putatively pathogenic FH variants with ≥30 observed carriers to 
      be significantly associated with elevated maxLDL (9.4-80.2 mg/dL). Phenotypic 
      effects were similar for European and African Americans despite substantial 
      differences in carrier frequencies. Based on observed effects on maxLDL, we 
      identified a total of 748 carriers (1:443) who had elevated maxLDL (36.5±1.4 
      mg/dL, p=1.2×10(-152)), and higher prevalence of clinical diagnoses related to 
      hypercholesterolemia and CHD in a phenome-wide scan. Adjusted for maxLDL, FH 
      variants collectively associated with higher prevalence of CHD (odds ratio, 1.59 
      [95% CI 1.36-1.86], p=1.1×10(-8)) but not peripheral artery disease. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The distribution and phenotypic effects of putatively pathogenic FH variants were 
      heterogeneous within and across variants. More robust evidence of 
      genotype-phenotype associations of FH variants in multi-ethnic populations is 
      needed to accurately infer at-risk individuals from genetic screening.

TI  - Tumor exosomes: a double-edged sword in cancer therapy.
PG  - 534-541
LID - 10.1038/aps.2018.17 [doi]
AB  - Tumor cells produce and secrete more nucleic acids, proteins and lipids than 
      normal cells. These molecules are transported in the blood or around the cells in 
      membrane-encapsulated exosomes. Tumor-derived or tumor-associated exosomes 
      (usually 30-100 nm in diameter) contain abundant biological contents resembling 
      those of the parent cells along with signaling messengers for intercellular 
      communication involved in the pathogenesis, development, progression, and 
      metastasis of cancer. As these exosomes can be detected and isolated from various 
      body fluids, they have become attractive new biomarkers for the diagnosis and 
      prognosis of cancer. Furthermore, tumor exosomes have also attracted increasing 
      attention due to their potential as novel therapeutic strategies for the 
      treatment of cancers. On the one hand, the lipid bilayer membrane-encapsulated 
      vesicles are promising carriers of drugs and other therapeutic materials 
      targeting specific cancer cells. On the other hand, tumor exosomes are important 
      mediators for modulation of the microenvironment that orchestrates events 
      critical to the growth and metastasis of cancer cells as well as chemoresistance. 
      Here, we summarize the advances in our understanding of tumor-associated or 
      tumor-derived exosomes in recent years, and discuss their roles in cancer 
      development, progression, invasion, and metastasis of cancers and, more 
      importantly, their potential in strategies for precision therapy of various 
      cancers as well as important caveats.

TI  - A comparison of genetic sampling methodologies for candidate-gene analyses.
LID - 10.15761/JTS.1000306 [doi]
AB  - Much of the recent gains in knowledge regarding the influence of patient genetics 
      on medication pharmacokinetics (drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and 
      elimination) how patients process medications) and pharmacodynamics (drug 
      response) have been attributed to the technologic advances in genetic testing 
      methodologies and the involvement of large clinical data sets and biobanks. 
      Indeed, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Phenome Wide Association 
      Studies (PWAS) along with ever-evolving biomedical informatics techniques and the 
      expansion of the -omics sciences (e.g., transcriptomics, metabolomics, 
      proteomics) have brought about unprecedented advances in precision medicine. 
      Although the simpler candidate-gene analysis technique is not considered 
      cutting-edge, it is reliable and important to the translation of pharmacogenomic 
      research and the advancement of precision medicine. Leveraging the knowledge of 
      biological plausibility (i.e., genetic mutation → altered function of protein 
      product → altered drug pharmacokinetics/dynamics) to appropriately select genes 
      for inclusion, the candidate-gene analysis technique does not necessitate large 
      patient cohorts nor extensive multi-gene genetic analysis arrays. It is often the 
      ideal method for clinicians to begin evaluating whether genetic information might 
      improve their pharmacologic treatment strategies for their patients. Having 
      access to specific patient populations and expertise regarding their medical 
      subspecialty, physician scientists can implement a candidate-gene analysis in 
      small cohorts. Even with less than 100 patients, results can often be used to 
      determine whether further investigation is warranted and to inform future 
      studies. Herein, we present a comparison of select contemporary methodologies 
      regarding collection, processing and genotype testing applicable to the efficient 
      implementation of candidate-gene studies.

TI  - Introgression from Populus balsamifera underlies adaptively significant variation 
      and range boundaries in P. trichocarpa.
PG  - 416-427
LID - 10.1111/nph.14779 [doi]
AB  - Introgression can be an important source of adaptive phenotypes, although 
      conversely it can have deleterious effects. Evidence for adaptive introgression 
      is accumulating but information on the genetic architecture of introgressed 
      traits lags behind. Here we determine trait architecture in Populus trichocarpa 
      under introgression from P. balsamifera using admixture mapping and phenotypic 
      analyses. Our results reveal that admixture is a key driver of clinal adaptation 
      and suggest that the northern range extension of P. trichocarpa depends, at least 
      in part, on introgression from P. balsamifera. However, admixture with 
      P. balsamifera can lead to potentially maladaptive early phenology, and a 
      reduction in growth and disease resistance in P. trichocarpa. Strikingly, an 
      introgressed chromosome 9 haplotype block from P. balsamifera restores the late 
      phenology and high growth parental phenotype in admixed P. trichocarpa. This 
      epistatic restorer block may be strongly advantageous in maximizing carbon 
      assimilation and disease resistance in the southernmost populations where 
      admixture has been detected. We also confirm a previously demonstrated case of 
      adaptive introgression in chromosome 15 and show that introgression generates a 
      transgressive chlorophyll-content phenotype. We provide strong support that 
      introgression provides a reservoir of genetic variation associated with adaptive 
      characters that allows improved survival in new environments.

TI  - Fc gamma receptors are expressed in the developing rat brain and activate 
      downstream signaling molecules upon cross-linking with immune complex.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/s12974-017-1050-z [doi]
LID - 7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure of the developing brain to immune mediators, including 
      antibodies, is postulated to increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders and 
      neurodegenerative disease. It has been suggested that immunoglobulin G-immune 
      complexes (IgG-IC) activate Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) expressed on neurons to 
      modify signaling events in these cells. However, testing this hypothesis is 
      hindered by a paucity of data regarding neuronal FcγR expression and function. 
      METHODS: FcγR transcript expression in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum of 
      neonatal male and female rats was investigated ex vivo and in mixed cultures of 
      primary hippocampal and cortical neurons and astrocytes using quantitative PCR 
      analyses. Expression at the protein level in mixed cultures of primary 
      hippocampal and cortical neurons and astrocytes was determined by 
      immunocytochemistry, western blotting, proteotype analysis, and flow cytometry. 
      The functionality of these receptors was assessed by measuring changes in 
      intracellular calcium levels, Erk phosphorylation, and IgG internalization 
      following stimulation with IgG-immune complexes. RESULTS: FcgrIa, FcgrIIa, 
      FcgrIIb, FcgrIIIa, and Fcgrt transcripts were detectable in the cortex, 
      hippocampus, and cerebellum at postnatal days 1 and 7. These transcripts were 
      also present in primary hippocampal and cortical cell cultures, where their 
      expression was modulated by IFNγ. Expression of FcγRIa, FcγRIIb, and FcγRIIIa, 
      but not FcγRIIa or FcRn proteins, was confirmed in cultured hippocampal and 
      cortical neurons and astrocytes at the single cell level. A subpopulation of 
      these cells co-expressed the activating FcγRIa and the inhibitory FcγRIIb. 
      Functional analyses demonstrated that exposure of hippocampal and cortical cell 
      cultures to IgG-IC increases intracellular calcium and Erk phosphorylation and 
      triggers FcγR-mediated internalization of IgG. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate 
      that developing neurons and astrocytes in the hippocampus and the cortex express 
      signaling competent FcγR. These findings suggest that IgG antibodies may 
      influence normal neurodevelopment or function via direct interactions with FcγR 
      on non-immune cells in the brain.

TI  - Association mapping by aerial drone reveals 213 genetic associations for Sorghum 
      bicolor biomass traits under drought.
PG  - 679
LID - 10.1186/s12864-018-5055-5 [doi]
LID - 679
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorghum bicolor is the fifth most commonly grown cereal worldwide and 
      is remarkable for its drought and abiotic stress tolerance. For these reasons and 
      the large size of biomass varieties, it has been proposed as a bioenergy crop. 
      However, little is known about the genes underlying sorghum's abiotic stress 
      tolerance and biomass yield. RESULTS: To uncover the genetic basis of drought 
      tolerance in sorghum at a genome-wide level, we undertook a high-density 
      phenomics genome wide association study (GWAS) in which 648 diverse sorghum lines 
      were phenotyped at two locations in California once per week by drone over the 
      course of a growing season. Biomass, height, and leaf area were measured by drone 
      for individual field plots, subjected to two drought treatments and a 
      well-watered control. The resulting dataset of ~ 171,000 phenotypic data-points 
      was analyzed along with 183,989 genotype by sequence markers to reveal 213 
      high-quality, replicated, and conserved GWAS associations. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      genomic intervals defined by the associations include many strong candidate 
      genes, including those encoding heat shock proteins, antifreeze proteins, and 
      other domains recognized as important to plant stress responses. The markers 
      identified by our study can be used for marker assisted selection for drought 
      tolerance and biomass. In addition, our results are a significant step toward 
      identifying specific sorghum genes controlling drought tolerance and biomass 
      yield.

AB  - Radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF) triggers physiological abnormalities. 
      Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is the phenotypic conversion of 
      endothelial cells to fibroblast-like cells and is involved in RIPF. In this 
      study, we established a phenomic screening platform to measure radiation-induced 
      stress fibers and optimized the conditions for high-throughput screening using 
      human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to develop compounds targeting 
      RIPF. The results of screening indicated that CHIR-99021 reduced 
      radiation-induced fibrosis, as evidenced by an enlargement of cell size and 
      increases in actin stress fibers and α-smooth muscle actin expression. These 
      effects were elicited without inducing serious toxicity in HUVECs, and the 
      cytotoxic effect of ionizing radiation (IR) in nonsmall cell lung cancer was also 
      enhanced. These results demonstrate that CHIR-99021 enhanced the effects of IR 
      therapy by suppressing radiation-induced EndMT in lung cancer.

AB  - Omics plays an important role in life sciences, which studies all the components 
      and their interrelations as a whole. The omics databases collected and sorted out 
      the relevant information to support omics research. The crop-omics database, 
      based on the major food crop information, especially on the sequencing 
      information and data mining, is set up to improve the basic research level of 
      crop sciences and production, which potentially benefit our grain stock. Here, we 
      summarize crop genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and phenomics, 
      explore the development and utilization status of crop-omics, and reveal that the 
      comprehensive utilization of multiple omics databases has become an important 
      research method for crop sciences in the era of high throughput information.

TI  - What will my child's future hold? phenotypes of intellectual development in 
      2-8-year-olds with autism spectrum disorder.
PG  - 121-132
LID - 10.1002/aur.1884 [doi]
AB  - We examined phenotypes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on trajectories of 
      intellectual development from early (ages 2-3 ½) to middle (ages 5-8) childhood 
      in a recent clinically ascertained cohort. Participants included 102 children (82 
      males) initially diagnosed with ASD from the Autism Phenome Project longitudinal 
      sample. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify distinct IQ 
      trajectories. Baseline and developmental course differences among groups were 
      assessed using univariate techniques and repeated measures regression models, 
      respectively. A four class model best represented the data. Using the highest 
      posterior probability, participants were assigned to High Challenges (25.5%), 
      Stable Low (17.6%), Changers (35.3%), and Lesser Challenges (21.6%) groups. The 
      High Challenges and Stable Low groups exhibited persistently low IQ, although, 
      the High Challenges group experienced declines while the Stable Low group's 
      scores remained more constant. Changers showed IQ improvement of > 2 standard 
      deviations. The Lesser Challenges group had IQs in the average range at both 
      times that were about 1 standard deviation higher at T2. In summation, 75% of the 
      participants experienced some relative improvements in intellectual and/or other 
      areas of functioning between ages 2 and 8 years. The Changers group demonstrated 
      the most significant IQ change that was accompanied by adaptive communication 
      improvement and declining externalizing symptoms. Only the Lesser Challenges 
      group showed a significant reduction in ASD symptom severity, such that by age 8, 
      14% of them no longer met ADOS-2 criteria for ASD. All groups showed reductions 
      in internalizing symptoms. Intervention history was not associated with group 
      status. Autism Res 2018, 11: 121-132. © 2017 International Society for Autism 
      Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: We examined how the IQs of 
      children with autism spectrum disorder change between ages 2 and 8, and 
      identified four patterns. Two groups exhibited persistently lower IQs. One group 
      showed IQ increases of greater than 30 points with improved communicate abilities 
      and declining disruptive behaviors. The final group had IQs in the average or 
      better range at both time points, and 14% of them lost their diagnoses. Over half 
      of the children experienced improved intellectual functioning between ages 2 and 
      8, whereas about 25% showed declines. Findings were not associated with 
      intervention history.

AB  - Introduction: The shortage of trained manpower in the field of mental health 
      remains a significant obstacle to the treatment of people with mental illnesses 
      in low and middle-income countries. In 2010, a new Master of Science in 
      Integrated Clinical and Community Mental Health (MSc ICCMH) program for 
      non-physician clinicians was established at Jimma University to address this 
      shortage in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the competency, satisfaction, 
      and involvement level of graduates of the program. Methods: A cross-sectional 
      study was conducted among the graduates of the program. Data were collected with 
      a semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire that was developed for the 
      study. Responses were recorded on a Likert scale to assess graduates' competency 
      and satisfaction level. The quantitative data were summarized by descriptive 
      statistics, including means, standard deviations, and frequencies. Qualitative 
      data were transcribed and analyzed thematically. Result: Until June 2015, 32 
      trainees had graduated from the MSc ICCMH program; 87.5% (n=28) of these 
      graduates participated in the study. Almost all (96.4%, n=27) graduates were 
      working in public institutions. The majority (75%, n=21) were directly engaged in 
      the clinical care of patients. Also, two-thirds of the graduates (67.9%, n=19) 
      were involved in mental health research. All of the graduates felt confident in 
      conducting psychiatric assessments of adults and identifying and managing common 
      mental disorders (100%, n=28). Similarly, 100% (n=28) of the graduates reported 
      that they felt confident in identifying and managing severe mental illnesses. 
      Conclusions: The outcome of the program is a considerable workforce of skilled 
      mental health professionals. The majority of graduates were retained within the 
      public mental health service. Brain drain does not appear to be a challenge among 
      non-physician mental health specialists. The findings on the self-perceived 
      competencies mirror the amount of clinical exposure during the training. With a 
      minimal revision of the curriculum, the level of satisfaction and competencies 
      can be enhanced.

TI  - The use of electronic health records for psychiatric phenotyping and genomics.
PG  - 601-612
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32548 [doi]
AB  - The widespread adoption of electronic health record (EHRs) in healthcare systems 
      has created a vast and continuously growing resource of clinical data and 
      provides new opportunities for population-based research. In particular, the 
      linking of EHRs to biospecimens and genomic data in biobanks may help address 
      what has become a rate-limiting study for genetic research: the need for large 
      sample sizes. The principal roadblock to capitalizing on these resources is the 
      need to establish the validity of phenotypes extracted from the EHR. For 
      psychiatric genetic research, this represents a particular challenge given that 
      diagnosis is based on patient reports and clinician observations that may not be 
      well-captured in billing codes or narrative records. This review addresses the 
      opportunities and pitfalls in EHR-based phenotyping with a focus on their 
      application to psychiatric genetic research. A growing number of studies have 
      demonstrated that diagnostic algorithms with high positive predictive value can 
      be derived from EHRs, especially when structured data are supplemented by text 
      mining approaches. Such algorithms enable semi-automated phenotyping for 
      large-scale case-control studies. In addition, the scale and scope of EHR 
      databases have been used successfully to identify phenotypic subgroups and derive 
      algorithms for longitudinal risk prediction. EHR-based genomics are particularly 
      well-suited to rapid look-up replication of putative risk genes, studies of 
      pleiotropy (phenomewide association studies or PheWAS), investigations of genetic 
      networks and overlap across the phenome, and pharmacogenomic research. EHR 
      phenotyping has been relatively under-utilized in psychiatric genomic research 
      but may become a key component of efforts to advance precision psychiatry.

AB  - Phenotypic image analysis is the task of recognizing variations in cell 
      properties using microscopic image data. These variations, produced through a 
      complex web of interactions between genes and the environment, may hold the key 
      to uncover important biological phenomena or to understand the response to a drug 
      candidate. Today, phenotypic analysis is rarely performed completely by hand. The 
      abundance of high-dimensional image data produced by modern high-throughput 
      microscopes necessitates computational solutions. Over the past decade, a number 
      of software tools have been developed to address this need. They use statistical 
      learning methods to infer relationships between a cell's phenotype and data from 
      the image. In this review, we examine the strengths and weaknesses of 
      non-commercial phenotypic image analysis software, cover recent developments in 
      the field, identify challenges, and give a perspective on future possibilities.

TI  - PheProb: probabilistic phenotyping using diagnosis codes to improve power for 
      genetic association studies.
PG  - 1359-1365
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocy056 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Standard approaches for large scale phenotypic screens using 
      electronic health record (EHR) data apply thresholds, such as ≥2 diagnosis codes, 
      to define subjects as having a phenotype. However, the variation in the accuracy 
      of diagnosis codes can impair the power of such screens. Our objective was to 
      develop and evaluate an approach which converts diagnosis codes into a 
      probability of a phenotype (PheProb). We hypothesized that this alternate 
      approach for defining phenotypes would improve power for genetic association 
      studies. METHODS: The PheProb approach employs unsupervised clustering to 
      separate patients into 2 groups based on diagnosis codes. Subjects are assigned a 
      probability of having the phenotype based on the number of diagnosis codes. This 
      approach was developed using simulated EHR data and tested in a real world EHR 
      cohort. In the latter, we tested the association between low density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol (LDL-C) genetic risk alleles known for association with 
      hyperlipidemia and hyperlipidemia codes (ICD-9 272.x). PheProb and thresholding 
      approaches were compared. RESULTS: Among n = 1462 subjects in the real world EHR 
      cohort, the threshold-based p-values for association between the genetic risk 
      score (GRS) and hyperlipidemia were 0.126 (≥1 code), 0.123 (≥2 codes), and 0.142 
      (≥3 codes). The PheProb approach produced the expected significant association 
      between the GRS and hyperlipidemia: p = .001. CONCLUSIONS: PheProb improves 
      statistical power for association studies relative to standard thresholding 
      approaches by leveraging information about the phenotype in the billing code 
      counts. The PheProb approach has direct applications where efficient approaches 
      are required, such as in Phenome-Wide Association Studies.

AB  - Deep learning (DL), a subset of machine learning approaches, has emerged as a 
      versatile tool to assimilate large amounts of heterogeneous data and provide 
      reliable predictions of complex and uncertain phenomena. These tools are 
      increasingly being used by the plant science community to make sense of the large 
      datasets now regularly collected via high-throughput phenotyping and genotyping. 
      We review recent work where DL principles have been utilized for digital 
      image-based plant stress phenotyping. We provide a comparative assessment of DL 
      tools against other existing techniques, with respect to decision accuracy, data 
      size requirement, and applicability in various scenarios. Finally, we outline 
      several avenues of research leveraging current and future DL tools in plant 
      science.

TI  - Fast Phenomics in Vineyards: Development of GRover, the Grapevine Rover, and 
      LiDAR for Assessing Grapevine Traits in the Field.
LID - 10.3390/s18092924 [doi]
LID - 2924
AB  - This paper introduces GRover (the grapevine rover), an adaptable mobile platform 
      for the deployment and testing of proximal imaging sensors in vineyards for the 
      non-destructive assessment of trunk and cordon volume and pruning weight. A SICK 
      LMS-400 light detection and ranging (LiDAR) radar mounted on GRover was capable 
      of producing precise (±3 mm) 3D point clouds of vine rows. Vineyard scans of the 
      grapevine variety Shiraz grown under different management systems at two separate 
      locations have demonstrated that GRover is able to successfully reproduce a 
      variety of vine structures. Correlations of pruning weight and vine wood (trunk 
      and cordon) volume with LiDAR scans have resulted in high coefficients of 
      determination (R² = 0.91 for pruning weight; 0.76 for wood volume). This is the 
      first time that a LiDAR of this type has been extensively tested in vineyards. 
      Its high scanning rate, eye safe laser and ability to distinguish tissue types 
      make it an appealing option for further development to offer breeders, and 
      potentially growers, quantified measurements of traits that otherwise would be 
      difficult to determine.

TI  - MiR-3606-3p inhibits systemic sclerosis through targeting TGF-β type II receptor.
PG  - 1967-1978

AB  - Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multisystemic fibrotic disease characterized by 
      excessive collagen deposition and extracellular matrix synthesis. Though 
      transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis 
      of SSc, the mechanism by which TGF-β signaling acts in SSc remains largely 
      unclear. Here, we showed that TGF-β type II receptor (TGFBR2) was significantly 
      upregulated in both human SSc dermal tissues and primary fibroblasts. In 
      fibroblasts, siRNA-induced knockdown of TGFBR2 resulted in a reduction of 
      p-SMAD2/3 levels and reduced production of type I collagen. Additionally, 
      functional experiments revealed that downregulation of TGFBR2 yielded an 
      anti-growth effect on fibroblasts through inhibiting cell cycle progression. 
      Further studies showed that miR-3606-3p could directly target the 3'-UTR of 
      TGFBR2 and significantly decrease the levels of both TGFBR2 mRNA and protein. 
      Furthermore, SSc dermal tissues and primary fibroblasts contain significantly 
      reduced amounts of miR-3606-3p, and the overexpression of miR-3606-3p in 
      fibroblasts replicates the phenotype of TGFBR2 downregulation. Collectively, our 
      findings demonstrated that increased TGFBR2 could be responsible for the 
      hyperactive TGF-β signaling observed in SSc. Moreover, we identified a pivotal 
      role for miR-3606-3p in SSc, which acts, at least partly, through the attenuation 
      of TGF-β signaling via TGFBR2 repression, suggesting that the regulation of 
      miR-3606-3p/TGFBR2 could be a promising therapeutic target that could improve the 
      treatment strategy for fibrosis.

TI  - Extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid in high-risk and normal-risk children with autism 
      aged 2-4 years: a case-control study.
PG  - 895-904
LID - S2215-0366(18)30294-3 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously showed, in two separate cohorts, that high-risk infants 
      who were later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder had abnormally high 
      extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume from age 6-24 months. The presence 
      of increased extra-axial CSF volume preceded the onset of behavioural symptoms of 
      autism and was predictive of a later diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. In 
      this study, we aimed to establish whether increased extra-axial CSF volume is 
      found in a large, independent sample of children diagnosed with autism spectrum 
      disorder, whether extra-axial CSF remains abnormally increased beyond infancy, 
      and whether it is present in both normal-risk and high-risk children with autism. 
      METHODS: In this case-control MRI study, children with autism spectrum disorder 
      or with typical development aged 2-4 years were recruited from the community to 
      the UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project, based in Sacramento, CA, USA. 
      The autism spectrum disorder group comprised children with autism spectrum 
      disorder who were either normal risk (ie, from simplex families) or high risk 
      (ie, from multiplex families). Measurements of extra-axial CSF volume, brain 
      volume, head circumference, sleep problems, and familial risk status were derived 
      from MRI and behavioural assessments. We applied a previously validated machine 
      learning algorithm based on extra-axial CSF volume, brain volume, age, and sex to 
      the current dataset. FINDINGS: Between July 20, 2007, and Dec 13, 2012, 159 
      children with autism spectrum disorder (132 male, 27 female) and 77 with typical 
      development (49 male, 28 female) underwent MRI scans. The autism spectrum 
      disorder group had an average of 15·1% more extra-axial CSF than controls after 
      accounting for differences in brain volume, weight, age, and sex (least-squares 
      mean 116·74 cm(3) [SE 3·33] in autism group vs 101·40 cm(3) [3·93] in typical 
      development group; p=0·007; Cohen's d = 0·39). Subgroups of normal-risk (n=132) 
      and high-risk (n=27) children with autism spectrum disorder had nearly identical 
      extra-axial CSF volumes (p=0·78), and both subgroups had significantly greater 
      volumes than controls. Both extra-axial CSF volume (p=0·004) and brain volume 
      (p<0·0001) uniquely contributed to enlarged head circumference in the autism 
      spectrum disorder group (p=0·04). Increased extra-axial CSF volume was associated 
      with greater sleep disturbances (p=0·03) and lower non-verbal ability (p=0·04). 
      The machine learning algorithm correctly predicted autism spectrum disorder 
      diagnosis with a positive predictive value of 83% (95% CI 76·2-88·3). 
      INTERPRETATION: Increased extra-axial CSF volume is a reliable brain anomaly that 
      has now been found in three independent cohorts, comprising both high-risk and 
      normal-risk children with autism spectrum disorder. Increased extra-axial CSF 
      volume is detectable using conventional structural MRI scans from infancy through 
      to age 3 years. These results suggest that increased extra-axial CSF volume could 
      be an early stratification biomarker of a biologically based subtype of autism 
      that might share a common underlying pathophysiology. FUNDING: US National

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of insulin 
      resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes. In the United Kingdom, Prospective Diabetes 
      Study and its 10-year post-trial monitoring, a beneficial effect of early 
      optimisation of blood glucose control is clearly demonstrated. In this study, we 
      investigated whether ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and the time point of 
      intervention can affect IR in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. Male C57B/L6 
      mice were fed chow diet (CD), high-fat high-sucrose diet (HFD), 
      CD + NAC(1-6) (NAC intervention 1st to 6th month), HFD + NAC(1-6), and 
      HFD + NAC(3-6) (NAC intervention 3rd to 6th month) for a 6-month treatment 
      course. HFD group showed significantly increased body weight (BW) and body fat, 
      decreased motor activity (MA), impaired intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test 
      (IPGTT), and insulin tolerance test (IPITT) throughout the study. HFD + NAC(1-6), 
      as compared with HFD group, had increased MA, improved IPGTT and IPITT since 
      first month, followed by decreased BW and body fat. HFD + NAC(3-6) group, 
      although showed improved IPGTT and IPITT than HFD group, still had higher BW, 
      decreased MA, and impaired IPGTT and IPITT as compared with HFD + NAC(1-6) at the 
      end of the study. NAC significantly increased MA, and ameliorated the HFD-induced 
      mitochondrial and intracellular ROS expression, DNA and protein oxidative damage, 
      and adipose tissue inflammation. We concluded that ROS scavenger can improve IR 
      and chronic inflammation in diet-induced obesity mice. This action is likely 
      better expressed through early intervention. The mechanism is probably through a 
      virtuous circle of suppressed oxidative stress, and increased motor activity, 
      which helps to reduce body fat.

TI  - Creating a functional single-chromosome yeast.
PG  - 331-335

AB  - Eukaryotic genomes are generally organized in multiple chromosomes. Here we have 
      created a functional single-chromosome yeast from a Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      haploid cell containing sixteen linear chromosomes, by successive end-to-end 
      chromosome fusions and centromere deletions. The fusion of sixteen native linear 
      chromosomes into a single chromosome results in marked changes to the global 
      three-dimensional structure of the chromosome due to the loss of all 
      centromere-associated inter-chromosomal interactions, most telomere-associated 
      inter-chromosomal interactions and 67.4% of intra-chromosomal interactions. 
      However, the single-chromosome and wild-type yeast cells have nearly identical 
      transcriptome and similar phenome profiles. The giant single chromosome can 
      support cell life, although this strain shows reduced growth across environments, 
      competitiveness, gamete production and viability. This synthetic biology study 
      demonstrates an approach to exploration of eukaryote evolution with respect to 
      chromosome structure and function.

TI  - Omics Approaches for Engineering Wheat Production under Abiotic Stresses.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19082390 [doi]
LID - 2390
AB  - Abiotic stresses greatly influenced wheat productivity executed by environmental 
      factors such as drought, salt, water submergence and heavy metals. The effective 
      management at the molecular level is mandatory for a thorough understanding of 
      plant response to abiotic stress. Understanding the molecular mechanism of stress 
      tolerance is complex and requires information at the omic level. In the areas of 
      genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics enormous progress has been made in the 
      omics field. The rising field of ionomics is also being utilized for examining 
      abiotic stress resilience in wheat. Omic approaches produce a huge amount of data 
      and sufficient developments in computational tools have been accomplished for 
      efficient analysis. However, the integration of omic-scale information to address 
      complex genetics and physiological questions is still a challenge. Though, the 
      incorporation of omic-scale data to address complex genetic qualities and 
      physiological inquiries is as yet a challenge. In this review, we have reported 
      advances in omic tools in the perspective of conventional and present day 
      approaches being utilized to dismember abiotic stress tolerance in wheat. 
      Attention was given to methodologies, for example, quantitative trait loci (QTL), 
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS). Comparative 
      genomics and candidate genes methodologies are additionally talked about 
      considering the identification of potential genomic loci, genes and biochemical 
      pathways engaged with stress resilience in wheat. This review additionally gives 
      an extensive list of accessible online omic assets for wheat and its effective 
      use. We have additionally addressed the significance of genomics in the 
      integrated approach and perceived high-throughput multi-dimensional phenotyping 
      as a significant restricting component for the enhancement of abiotic stress 
      resistance in wheat.

TI  - Virus-induced gene silencing database for phenomics and functional genomics in 
      Nicotiana benthamiana.

AB  - Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is an important forward and reverse genetics 
      method for the study of gene function in many plant species, especially Nicotiana 
      benthamiana. However, despite the widespread use of VIGS, a searchable database 
      compiling the phenotypes observed with this method is lacking. Such a database 
      would allow researchers to know the phenotype associated with the silencing of a 
      large number of individual genes without experimentation. We have developed a 
      VIGS phenomics and functional genomics database (VPGD) that has DNA sequence 
      information derived from over 4,000 N. benthamiana VIGS clones along with the 
      associated silencing phenotype for approximately 1,300 genes. The VPGD has a 
      built-in BLAST search feature that provides silencing phenotype information of 
      specific genes. In addition, a keyword-based search function could be used to 
      find a specific phenotype of interest with the corresponding gene, including its 
      Gene Ontology descriptions. Query gene sequences from other plant species that 
      have not been used for VIGS can also be searched for their homologs and silencing 
      phenotype in N. benthamiana. VPGD is useful for identifying gene function not 
      only in N. benthamiana but also in related Solanaceae plants such as tomato and 
      potato. The database is accessible at http://vigs.noble.org.

TI  - Performance of a kerb side inlet to irrigate street trees and to improve road 
      runoff water quality: a comparison of four media types.
PG  - 33995-34007
LID - 10.1007/s11356-018-3083-y [doi]
AB  - The TREENET inlet is an emerging water-sensitive urban design technology that 
      consists of a novel kerb side inlet coupled with a leaky well infiltration 
      system. The inlets have been retrofitted to existing roads since 2006; however, 
      there is currently little information available on the effectiveness of these 
      inlet and leaky well systems. This study investigated the performance of the kerb 
      side inlets and leaky well system for water quality improvement prior to 
      infiltration to native soil. The leaky wells included four filter media types, 
      namely gravel, water treatment solids, sandy loam and clay. To compare the 
      performance of the four filter media types, batch and column studies were 
      performed in the laboratory. The best performance was observed using the sandy 
      loam as a filter media, followed by clay, water treatment solids and then gravel. 
      The selection of effective media for removal of heavy metals is important as each 
      media type has different pollutant removal capacity, infiltration and clogging 
      performance.

PG  - 3014-3024
LID - 10.1038/s41396-018-0224-8 [doi]
AB  - Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mediated by the spread of plasmids fuels evolution 
      in prokaryotes. Although plasmids provide bacteria with new adaptive genes, they 
      also produce physiological alterations that often translate into a reduction in 
      bacterial fitness. The fitness costs associated with plasmids represent an 
      important limit to plasmid maintenance in bacterial communities, but their 
      molecular origins remain largely unknown. In this work, we combine phenomics, 
      transcriptomics and metabolomics to study the fitness effects produced by a 
      collection of diverse plasmids in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa PAO1. Using this approach, we scan the physiological changes imposed 
      by plasmids and test the generality of some main mechanisms that have been 
      proposed to explain the cost of HGT, including increased biosynthetic burden, 
      reduced translational efficiency, and impaired chromosomal replication. Our 
      results suggest that the fitness effects of plasmids have a complex origin, since 
      none of these mechanisms could individually provide a general explanation for the 
      cost of plasmid carriage. Interestingly, our results also showed that plasmids 
      alter the expression of a common set of metabolic genes in PAO1, and produce 
      convergent changes in host cell metabolism. These surprising results suggest that 
      there is a common metabolic response to plasmids in P. aeruginosa PAO1.

AB  - Metabolic diseases are a worldwide problem but the underlying genetic factors and 
      their relevance to metabolic disease remain incompletely understood. Genome-wide 
      research is needed to characterize so-far unannotated mammalian metabolic genes. 
      Here, we generate and analyze metabolic phenotypic data of 2016 knockout mouse 
      strains under the aegis of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) 
      and find 974 gene knockouts with strong metabolic phenotypes. 429 of those had no 
      previous link to metabolism and 51 genes remain functionally completely 
      unannotated. We compared human orthologues of these uncharacterized genes in five 
      GWAS consortia and indeed 23 candidate genes are associated with metabolic 
      disease. We further identify common regulatory elements in promoters of candidate 
      genes. As each regulatory element is composed of several transcription factor 
      binding sites, our data reveal an extensive metabolic phenotype-associated 
      network of co-regulated genes. Our systematic mouse phenotype analysis thus paves 
      the way for full functional annotation of the genome.

TI  - GENOMICS AND SYSTEMS BIOLOGY APPROACHES IN THE STUDY OF LIPID DISORDERS.
PG  - 217-223
LID - 10.24875/RIC.18002576 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a broad definition for diseases of the heart and 
      blood vessels with high mortality and morbidity worldwide. Atherosclerosis and 
      hypertension are the most common causes of CVD, and multiple factors confer the 
      susceptibility. Some of the predisposing factors are modifiable such as diet, 
      smoking, and exercise, whereas others, including age, sex, and individual's 
      genetic variations contributing to the CVD composition traits, are 
      non-modifiable. This latter group includes serum lipid traits. High serum lipid 
      levels, specifically high levels of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and 
      triglycerides, are well-established key risk factors of atherosclerosis. This 
      review will discuss genomics and systems biology approaches in the study of 
      common dyslipidemias. The non-Mendelian forms of dyslipidemias are highly 
      complex, and the molecular mechanisms underlying these polygenic lipid disorders 
      are estimated to involve hundreds of genes. Interactions between the different 
      genes and environmental factors also contribute to the clinical outcomes; 
      however, very little is known about these interactions and their molecular 
      mechanisms. To better address the complex genetic architecture and multiple 
      properties leading to high serum lipid levels, networks and systems approach 
      combining information at genomic, transcriptomics, methylomics, proteomics, 
      metabolomics, and phenome level are being developed, with the ultimate goal to 
      elucidate the cascade of dynamic changes leading to CVD in humans. (REV INVEST 
      CLIN. 2018;70:217-23).

TI  - Defining Phenotypes from Clinical Data to Drive Genomic Research.
PG  - 69-92
LID - 10.1146/annurev-biodatasci-080917-013335 [doi]
AB  - The rise in available longitudinal patient information in electronic health 
      records (EHRs) and their coupling to DNA biobanks has resulted in a dramatic 
      increase in genomic research using EHR data for phenotypic information. EHRs have 
      the benefit of providing a deep and broad data source of health-related 
      phenotypes, including drug response traits, expanding the phenome available to 
      researchers for discovery. The earliest efforts at repurposing EHR data for 
      research involved manual chart review of limited numbers of patients but now 
      typically involve applications of rule-based and machine learning algorithms 
      operating on sometimes huge corpora for both genome-wide and phenome-wide 
      approaches. We highlight here the current methods, impact, challenges, and 
      opportunities for repurposing clinical data to define patient phenotypes for 
      genomics discovery. Use of EHR data has proven a powerful method for elucidation 
      of genomic influences on diseases, traits, and drug-response phenotypes and will 
      continue to have increasing applications in large cohort studies.

AB  - Genomic selection - the prediction of breeding values using DNA polymorphisms - 
      is a disruptive method that has widely been adopted by animal and plant breeders 
      to increase productivity. It was recently shown that other sources of molecular 
      variations such as those resulting from transcripts or metabolites could be used 
      to accurately predict complex traits. These endophenotypes have the advantage of 
      capturing the expressed genotypes and consequently the complex regulatory 
      networks that occur in the different layers between the genome and the phenotype. 
      However, obtaining such omics data at very large scales, such as those typically 
      experienced in breeding, remains challenging. As an alternative, we proposed 
      using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a high-throughput, low cost and 
      non-destructive tool to indirectly capture endophenotypic variants and compute 
      relationship matrices for predicting complex traits, and coined this new approach 
      "phenomic selection" (PS). We tested PS on two species of economic interest 
      (Triticum aestivum L. and Populus nigra L.) using NIRS on various tissues 
      (grains, leaves, wood). We showed that one could reach predictions as accurate as 
      with molecular markers, for developmental, tolerance and productivity traits, 
      even in environments radically different from the one in which NIRS were 
      collected. Our work constitutes a proof of concept and provides new perspectives 
      for the breeding community, as PS is theoretically applicable to any organism at 
      low cost and does not require any molecular information.

TI  - Pulling the covers in electronic health records for an association study with 
      self-reported sleep behaviors.
PG  - 1702-1712
LID - 10.1080/07420528.2018.1508152 [doi]
AB  - The electronic health record (EHR) contains rich histories of clinical care, but 
      has not traditionally been mined for information related to sleep habits. Here, 
      we performed a retrospective EHR study based on a cohort of 3,652 individuals 
      with self-reported sleep behaviors documented from visits to the sleep clinic. 
      These individuals were obese (mean body mass index 33.6 kg/m(2)) and had a high 
      prevalence of sleep apnea (60.5%), however we found sleep behaviors largely 
      concordant with prior prospective cohort studies. In our cohort, average wake 
      time was 1 hour later and average sleep duration was 40 minutes longer on 
      weekends than on weekdays (p < 10(-12)). Sleep duration varied considerably as a 
      function of age and tended to be longer in females and in whites. Additionally, 
      through phenome-wide association analyses, we found an association of long 
      weekend sleep with depression, and an unexpectedly large number of associations 
      of long weekday sleep with mental health and neurological disorders (q < 0.05). 
      We then sought to replicate previously published genetic associations with 
      morning/evening preference on a subset of our cohort with extant genotyping data 
      (n = 555). While those findings did not replicate in our cohort, a polymorphism 
      (rs3754214) in high linkage disequilibrium with a previously published 
      polymorphism near TARS2 was associated with long sleep duration (p < 0.01). 
      Collectively, our results highlight the potential of the EHR for uncovering the 
      correlates of human sleep in real-world populations.

AB  - Progress in remote sensing and robotic technologies decreases the hardware costs 
      of phenotyping. Here, we first review cost-effective imaging devices and 
      environmental sensors, and present a trade-off between investment and manpower 
      costs. We then discuss the structure of costs in various real-world scenarios. 
      Hand-held low-cost sensors are suitable for quick and infrequent plant diagnostic 
      measurements. In experiments for genetic or agronomic analyses, (i) major costs 
      arise from plant handling and manpower; (ii) the total costs per plant/microplot 
      are similar in robotized platform or field experiments with drones, hand-held or 
      robotized ground vehicles; (iii) the cost of vehicles carrying sensors represents 
      only 5-26% of the total costs. These conclusions depend on the context, in 
      particular for labor cost, the quantitative demand of phenotyping and the number 
      of days available for phenotypic measurements due to climatic constraints. Data 
      analysis represents 10-20% of total cost if pipelines have already been 
      developed. A trade-off exists between the initial high cost of pipeline 
      development and labor cost of manual operations. Overall, depending on the 
      context and objsectives, "cost-effective" phenotyping may involve either low 
      investment ("affordable phenotyping"), or initial high investments in sensors, 
      vehicles and pipelines that result in higher quality and lower operational costs.

TI  - Analysis of the Influence of microRNAs in Lithium Response in Bipolar Disorder.
PG  - 207
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00207 [doi]
LID - 207
AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common, highly heritable neuropsychiatric disease 
      characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. Lithium is the 
      best-established long-term treatment for BD, even though individual response is 
      highly variable. Evidence suggests that some of this variability has a genetic 
      basis. This is supported by the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 
      lithium response to date conducted by the International Consortium on Lithium 
      Genetics (ConLiGen). Recently, we performed the first genome-wide analysis of the 
      involvement of miRNAs in BD and identified nine BD-associated miRNAs. However, it 
      is unknown whether these miRNAs are also associated with lithium response in BD. 
      In the present study, we therefore tested whether common variants at these nine 
      candidate miRNAs contribute to the variance in lithium response in BD. 
      Furthermore, we systematically analyzed whether any other miRNA in the genome is 
      implicated in the response to lithium. For this purpose, we performed gene-based 
      tests for all known miRNA coding genes in the ConLiGen GWAS dataset (n = 2,563 
      patients) using a set-based testing approach adapted from the versatile 
      gene-based test for GWAS (VEGAS2). In the candidate approach, miR-499a showed a 
      nominally significant association with lithium response, providing some evidence 
      for involvement in both development and treatment of BD. In the genome-wide miRNA 
      analysis, 71 miRNAs showed nominally significant associations with the 
      dichotomous phenotype and 106 with the continuous trait for treatment response. A 
      total of 15 miRNAs revealed nominal significance in both phenotypes with miR-633 
      showing the strongest association with the continuous trait (p = 9.80E-04) and 
      miR-607 with the dichotomous phenotype (p = 5.79E-04). No association between 
      miRNAs and treatment response to lithium in BD in either of the tested conditions 
      withstood multiple testing correction. Given the limited power of our study, the 
      investigation of miRNAs in larger GWAS samples of BD and lithium response is 
      warranted.

TI  - From Genomics to Omics Landscapes of Parkinson's Disease: Revealing the Molecular 
      Mechanisms.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1089/omi.2017.0181 [doi]
AB  - Molecular mechanisms of Parkinson's disease (PD) have already been investigated 
      in various different omics landscapes. We reviewed the literature about different 
      omics approaches between November 2005 and November 2017 to depict the main 
      pathological pathways for PD development. In total, 107 articles exploring 
      different layers of omics data associated with PD were retrieved. The studies 
      were grouped into 13 omics layers: genomics-DNA level, transcriptomics, 
      epigenomics, proteomics, ncRNomics, interactomics, metabolomics, glycomics, 
      lipidomics, phenomics, environmental omics, pharmacogenomics, and integromics. We 
      discussed characteristics of studies from different landscapes, such as main 
      findings, number of participants, sample type, methodology, and outcome. We also 
      performed curation and preliminary synthesis of multiple omics data, and 
      identified overlapping results, which could lead toward selection of biomarkers 
      for further validation of PD risk loci. Biomarkers could support the development 
      of targeted prognostic/diagnostic panels as a tool for early diagnosis and 
      prediction of progression rate and prognosis. This review presents an example of 
      a comprehensive approach to revealing the underlying processes and risk factors 
      of a complex disease. It urges scientists to structure the already known data and 
      integrate it into a meaningful context.

AB  - Improved genetic, genomic and statistical technologies have increased the 
      capacity to enrich breeding populations for key alleles underpinning adaptation 
      and continued genetic gain. In turn, directed genomic selection together with 
      increased heritability will reduce genetic variance to narrow the genetic base in 
      many crop breeding programs. Diverse genetic resources (GR), including wild and 
      weedy relatives, landraces and reconstituted synthetics, have potential to 
      contribute novel alleles for key traits. Targeted trait identification may also 
      identify genetic diversity in addressing new challenges including the need for 
      modified root architecture, greater nutrient-use efficiency, and adaptation to 
      warmer air and soil temperatures forecast with climate change. Yet while core 
      collections and other GR sources have historically been invaluable for major gene 
      control of disease and subsoil constraints, the mining of genetically (and 
      phenotypically) complex traits in GR remains a significant challenge owing to 
      reduced fertility, limited seed quantities and poor adaptation through linkage 
      drag with undesirable alleles. High-throughput field phenomics (HTFP) offers the 
      opportunity to capture phenotypically complex variation underpinning adaptation 
      in traditional phenotypic selection or statistics-based breeding programs. 
      Targeted HTFP will permit the reliable phenotyping of greater numbers of 
      GR-derived breeding lines using smaller plot sizes and at earlier stages of 
      population development to reduce the duration of breeding cycles and the loss of 
      potentially important alleles with linkage drag. Two key opportunities are 
      highlighted for use of HTFP in selection among GR-derived wheat breeding lines 
      for greater biomass and stomatal conductance through canopy temperature.

TI  - Phenomic Impact of Genetically-Determined Euthyroid Function and Molecular 
      Differences between Thyroid Disorders.
LID - 10.3390/jcm7100296 [doi]
LID - 296
AB  - BACKGROUND: The thyroid plays a key role in development and homeostasis, but it 
      has been difficult to establish causality with diseases and phenotypic traits 
      because of several potential confounders. METHODS: To determine the causal effect 
      of euthyroid function, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization study of 
      euthyroid thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels with respect to 2419 
      traits assessed in 337,199 individuals from UK Biobank. Additionally, we 
      investigated the molecular differences between hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism 
      using genome-wide data. RESULTS: After multiple testing correction, sixteen 
      traits appear to be affected by genetically-determined euthyroid TSH, including 
      multiple thyroid-related traits, e.g., hypothyroidism (p = 2.39 × 10(-17)), 
      height (p = 2.76 × 10(-10)), body fat distribution (impedance of whole body, p = 
      4.43 × 10(-8)), pulse rate (p = 2.84 × 10(-8)), female infertility (p = 4.91 × 
      10(-6)), and hearing aid use (p = 7.10 × 10(-5)). Moreover, we found a consistent 
      genetic correlation between hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (rg = 0.45, p = 
      5.45 × 10(-6)) with several immune pathways shared between these diseases. Two 
      molecular pathways survived multiple testing correction for specificity to 
      hyperthyroidism, JAK/STAT signaling (p = 1.02 × 10(-6)) and Rac guanyl-nucleotide 
      exchange factor activity (p = 4.39 × 10(-6)). CONCLUSION: Our data shed new light 
      on the inter-individual variability of euthyroid function and the molecular 
      mechanisms of the two thyroid disorders investigated.

AB  - Quantitative research, especially in the field of radio(geno)mics, has helped us 
      understand fundamental mechanisms of neurologic diseases. Such research is 
      integrally based on advanced algorithms to derive extensive radiomic features and 
      integrate them into diagnostic and predictive models. To exploit the benefit of 
      such complex algorithms, their swift translation into clinical practice is 
      required, currently hindered by their complicated nature. brain-CaPTk is a 
      modular platform, with components spanning across image processing, segmentation, 
      feature extraction, and machine learning, that facilitates such translation, 
      enabling quantitative analyses without requiring substantial computational 
      background. Thus, brain-CaPTk can be seamlessly integrated into the typical 
      quantification, analysis and reporting workflow of a radiologist, underscoring 
      its clinical potential. This paper describes currently available components of 
      brain-CaPTk and example results from their application in glioblastoma.

AB  - Agricultural disciplines are becoming data intensive and the agricultural 
      research data generation technologies are becoming sophisticated and high 
      throughput. On the one hand, high-throughput genotyping is generating petabytes 
      of data; on the other hand, high-throughput phenotyping platforms are also 
      generating data of similar magnitude. Under modern integrated crop breeding, 
      scientists are working together by integrating genomic and phenomic data sets of 
      huge data volumes on a routine basis. To manage such huge research data sets and 
      use them appropriately in decision making, Data Management Analysis & Decision 
      Support Tools (DMASTs) are a prerequisite. DMASTs are required for a range of 
      operations including generating the correct breeding experiments, maintaining 
      pedigrees, managing phenotypic data, storing and retrieving high-throughput 
      genotypic data, performing analytics, including trial analysis, spatial 
      adjustments, identifications of MTAs, predicting Genomic Breeding Values (GEBVs), 
      and various selection indices. DMASTs are also a prerequisite for understanding 
      trait dynamics, gene action, interactions, biology, GxE, and various other 
      factors contributing to crop improvement programs by integrating data generated 
      from various science streams. These tools have simplified scientists' lives and 
      empowered them in terms of data storage, data retrieval, data analytics, data 
      visualization, and sharing with other researchers and collaborators. This chapter 
      focuses on availability, uses, and gaps in present-day DMASTs. Graphical

TI  - Large-Scale Phenome-Wide Association Study of PCSK9 Variants Demonstrates 
      Protection Against Ischemic Stroke.
PG  - e002162
LID - 10.1161/CIRCGEN.118.002162 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: PCSK9 inhibition is a potent new therapy for hypercholesterolemia and 
      cardiovascular disease. Although short-term clinical trial results have not 
      demonstrated major adverse effects, long-term data will not be available for some 
      time. Genetic studies in large biobanks offer a unique opportunity to predict 
      drug effects and provide context for the evaluation of future clinical trial 
      outcomes. METHODS: We tested the association of the PCSK9 missense variant 
      rs11591147 with predefined phenotypes and phenome-wide, in 337 536 individuals of 
      British ancestry in the UK Biobank, with independent discovery and replication. 
      Using a Bayesian statistical method, we leveraged phenotype correlations to 
      evaluate the phenome-wide impact of PCSK9 inhibition with higher power at a finer 
      resolution. RESULTS: The T allele of rs11591147 showed a protective effect on 
      hyperlipidemia (odds ratio, 0.63±0.04; P=2.32×10(-38)), coronary heart disease 
      (odds ratio, 0.73±0.09; P=1.05×10(-6)), and ischemic stroke (odds ratio, 
      0.61±0.18; P=2.40×10(-3)) and was associated with increased type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus risk adjusted for lipid-lowering medication status (odds ratio, 
      1.24±0.10; P=1.98×10(-7)). We did not observe associations with cataracts, heart 
      failure, atrial fibrillation, and cognitive dysfunction. Leveraging phenotype 
      correlations, we observed evidence of a protective association with cerebral 
      infarction and vascular occlusion. These results explore the effects of direct 
      PCSK9 inhibition; off-target effects cannot be predicted using this approach. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This result represents the first genetic evidence in a large cohort 
      for the protective effect of PCSK9 inhibition on ischemic stroke and corroborates 
      exploratory evidence from clinical trials. PCSK9 inhibition was not associated 
      with variables other than those related to LDL (low-density lipoprotein) 
      cholesterol, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, suggesting that other 
      effects are either small or absent.

TI  - Evolutionarily conserved partial gene duplication in the Triticeae tribe of 
      grasses confers pathogen resistance.
PG  - 116

AB  - BACKGROUND: The large and highly repetitive genomes of the cultivated species 
      Hordeum vulgare (barley), Triticum aestivum (wheat), and Secale cereale (rye) 
      belonging to the Triticeae tribe of grasses appear to be particularly rich in 
      gene-like sequences including partial duplicates. Most of them have been 
      classified as putative pseudogenes. In this study we employ transient and stable 
      gene silencing- and over-expression systems in barley to study the function of 
      HvARM1 (for H. vulgare Armadillo 1), a partial gene duplicate of the 
      U-box/armadillo-repeat E3 ligase HvPUB15 (for H. vulgare Plant U-Box 15). 
      RESULTS: The partial ARM1 gene is derived from a gene-duplication event in a 
      common ancestor of the Triticeae and contributes to quantitative host as well as 
      nonhost resistance to the biotrophic powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis. In 
      barley, allelic variants of HvARM1 but not of HvPUB15 are significantly 
      associated with levels of powdery mildew infection. Both HvPUB15 and HvARM1 
      proteins interact in yeast and plant cells with the susceptibility-related, 
      plastid-localized barley homologs of THF1 (for Thylakoid formation 1) and of 
      ClpS1 (for Clp-protease adaptor S1) of Arabidopsis thaliana. A genome-wide scan 
      for partial gene duplicates reveals further events in barley resulting in 
      stress-regulated, potentially neo-functionalized, genes. CONCLUSION: The results 
      suggest neo-functionalization of the partial gene copy HvARM1 increases 
      resistance against powdery mildew infection. It further links plastid function 
      with susceptibility to biotrophic pathogen attack. These findings shed new light 
      on a novel mechanism to employ partial duplication of protein-protein interaction 
      domains to facilitate the expansion of immune signaling networks.

AB  - Postmortem studies in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) have revealed deficits in 
      myelination, abnormalities in myelin gene expression and altered numbers of 
      oligodendrocytes in the brain. However, gaining mechanistic insight into 
      oligodendrocyte (OL) dysfunction and its contribution to SCZ has been challenging 
      because of technical hurdles. The advent of individual patient-derived 
      human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), combined with the generation of in 
      principle any neuronal and glial cell type, including OLs and oligodendrocyte 
      precursor cells (OPCs), holds great potential for understanding the molecular 
      basis of the aetiopathogenesis of genetically complex psychiatric diseases such 
      as SCZ and could pave the way towards personalized medicine. The development of 
      neuronal and glial co-culture systems now appears to enable the in vitro study of 
      SCZ-relevant neurobiological endophenotypes, including OL dysfunction and 
      myelination, with unprecedented construct validity. Nonetheless, the meaningful 
      stratification of patients before the subsequent functional analyses of 
      patient-derived cell systems still represents an important bottleneck. Here, to 
      improve the predictive power of ex vivo disease modelling we propose using hiPSC 
      technology to focus on representatives of patient subgroups stratified for 
      genomic and/or phenomic features and neurobiological cell systems. Therefore, 
      this review will outline the evidence for the involvement of OPCs/OLs in SCZ in 
      the context of their proposed functions, including myelination and axon support, 
      the implications for hiPSC-based cellular disease modelling and potential 
      strategies for patient selection.

AB  - Plants would experience more complex environments, such as sudden heat shock 
      (SHS) stress combined with elevated CO(2) in the future, and might adapt to this 
      stressful condition by optimizing photosynthetic carbon metabolism (PCM). It is 
      interesting to understand whether this acclimation process would be altered in 
      different genotypes of maize under elevated CO(2), and which metabolites 
      represent key indicators reflecting the photosynthetic rates (P(N)) following 
      SHS. Although B76 had greater reduction in P(N) during SHS treatment, our results 
      indicated that P(N) in genotype B76, displayed faster recovery after SHS 
      treatment under elevated CO(2) than in genotype B106. Furthermore, we employed a 
      stepwise feature extraction approach by partial linear regression model. Our 
      findings demonstrated that 9 key metabolites over the total (35 metabolites) can 
      largely explain the variance of P(N) during recovery from SHS across two maize 
      genotypes and two CO(2) grown conditions. Of these key metabolites, malate, 
      valine, isoleucine, glucose and starch are positively correlated with recovery 
      pattern of P(N). Malate metabolites responses to SHS were further discussed by 
      incorporating with the activities and gene expression of three C(4) 
      photosynthesis-related key enzymes. We highlighted the importance of malate 
      metabolism during photosynthesis recovery from short-term SHS, and data 
      integration analysis to better comprehend the regulatory framework of PCM in 
      response to abiotic stress.

AB  - Metastatic cancers impose significant burdens on patients, affecting quality of 
      life, morbidity, and mortality. Even during remission, microscopic metastases can 
      lurk, but few therapies directly target tumor cell metastasis. Agents that 
      interfere with this process would represent a new paradigm in cancer management, 
      changing the 'waiting game' into a time of active prevention. These therapies 
      could take multiple forms based on the pathways involved in the metastatic 
      process. For example, a phenome-wide association study showed that a single 
      nucleotide polymorphism in the gene TBXA2R is associated with increased 
      metastasis in multiple primary cancers (P = 0.003), suggesting clinical 
      applicability of TBXA2R antagonists. Emerging data related to the role of 
      platelets in metastasis are concordant with our sense that these pathways present 
      significant opportunities for therapeutic development. However, before real 
      progress can be made toward clinical targeting of the metastatic process, 
      foundational work is needed to define informative measures of critical elements 
      such as circulating tumor cells and tumor DNA, and circulatory vs. lymphatic 
      spread. These challenges require an expansion of team science and composition to 
      obtain competitive funding. At our academic medical center, we have implemented a 
      Cancer Metastasis Inhibition (CMI) program investigating this approach across 
      multiple cancers.

AB  - Taxanes are chemotherapeutic drugs employed in the clinic to treat a variety of 
      malignancies. Despite their overall efficacy, cancer cells often display 
      resistance to taxanes. Therefore, new strategies to increase the effectiveness of 
      taxane-based chemotherapeutics are urgently needed. Multiple molecular players 
      are linked to taxane resistance; these include efflux pumps, DNA repair 
      mechanisms, and hypoxia-related pathways. In addition, emerging evidence 
      indicates that both non-coding RNAs and epigenetic effectors might also be 
      implicated in taxane resistance. Here we focus on the causes of taxane 
      resistance, with the aim to envisage an integrated model of the 'taxane 
      resistance phenome'. This model could help the development of novel therapeutic 
      strategies to treat taxane-resistant neoplasms.

TI  - Comorbidities in Childhood Celiac Disease: A Phenome Wide Association Study Using 
      the Electronic Health Record.
PG  - 488-493
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000002020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is associated with a variety of extraintestinal 
      autoimmune and inflammatory findings that manifest clinically as symptoms and 
      comorbidities. Understanding these comorbidities may improve identification of 
      the disease and prevent sequelae. In this study, we use an unbiased electronic 
      health record (EHR)-based Phenome Wide Association Study (PheWAS) method to 
      confirm known comorbidities, discover novel associations and enhance 
      characterization of the clinical presentation of CD in children. METHODS: Data 
      were extracted from the Nationwide Children's Hospital EHR. Confirmed CD cases 
      (n = 433) were matched with 4330 randomly selected controls. Utilizing an 
      EHR-based PheWAS method to analyze associations of phenotypes with CD, we 
      conducted an unbiased screening of all International Classification of Diseases, 
      10th revision diagnostic codes and examined significance by performing Fisher's 
      Exact tests. We further tested for the association between CD and 14 previously 
      identified comorbidities in an a priori fashion. RESULTS: We found 45 
      International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision codes significantly 
      associated with CD. Thirteen are known comorbidities and nine are expected 
      symptoms of CD, thus validating our study methods. Further investigation found 
      symptoms that characterized CD clinically and discovered a significant 
      association between eosinophilic disorders of the esophagus and CD. Of 14 
      previously identified comorbidities, 8 were significantly associated with CD. 
      CONCLUSIONS: An EHR-based PheWAS method is a powerful, efficient, and 
      cost-effective method to screen for possible CD comorbidities and validate 
      associations at the population level. Ours is the first PheWAS of CD to confirm a 
      significant association of eosinophilic disorders of the esophagus with CD in a 
      controlled study.

TI  - Evaluating RGB Imaging and Multispectral Active and Hyperspectral Passive Sensing 
      for Assessing Early Plant Vigor in Winter Wheat.
LID - 10.3390/s18092931 [doi]
LID - 2931
AB  - Plant vigor is an important trait of field crops at early growth stages, 
      influencing weed suppression, nutrient and water use efficiency and plant growth. 
      High-throughput techniques for its evaluation are required and are promising for 
      nutrient management in early growth stages and for detecting promising breeding 
      material in plant phenotyping. However, spectral sensing for assessing early 
      plant vigor in crops is limited by the strong soil background reflection. Digital 
      imaging may provide a low-cost, easy-to-use alternative. Therefore, image 
      segmentation for retrieving canopy cover was applied in a trial with three 
      cultivars of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown under two nitrogen regimes 
      and in three sowing densities during four early plant growth stages (Zadok's 
      stages 14⁻32) in 2017. Imaging-based canopy cover was tested in correlation 
      analysis for estimating dry weight, nitrogen uptake and nitrogen content. An 
      active Greenseeker sensor and various established and newly developed vegetation 
      indices and spectral unmixing from a passive hyperspectral spectrometer were used 
      as alternative approaches and additionally tested for retrieving canopy cover. 
      Before tillering (until Zadok's stage 20), correlation coefficients for dry 
      weight and nitrogen uptake with canopy cover strongly exceeded all other methods 
      and remained on higher levels (R² > 0.60***) than from the Greenseeker 
      measurements until tillering. From early tillering on, red edge based indices 
      such as the NDRE and a newly extracted normalized difference index (736 nm; ~794 
      nm) were identified as best spectral methods for both traits whereas the 
      Greenseeker and spectral unmixing correlated best with canopy cover. 
      RGB-segmentation could be used as simple low-cost approach for very early growth 
      stages until early tillering whereas the application of multispectral sensors 
      should consider red edge bands for subsequent stages.

TI  - Phenomics allows identification of genomic regions affecting maize stomatal 
      conductance with conditional effects of water deficit and evaporative demand.
PG  - 314-326
LID - 10.1111/pce.13083 [doi]
AB  - Stomatal conductance is central for the trades-off between hydraulics and 
      photosynthesis. We aimed at deciphering its genetic control and that of its 
      responses to evaporative demand and water deficit, a nearly impossible task with 
      gas exchanges measurements. Whole-plant stomatal conductance was estimated via 
      inversion of the Penman-Monteith equation from data of transpiration and plant 
      architecture collected in a phenotyping platform. We have analysed jointly 4 
      experiments with contrasting environmental conditions imposed to a panel of 254 
      maize hybrids. Estimated whole-plant stomatal conductance closely correlated with 
      gas-exchange measurements and biomass accumulation rate. Sixteen robust 
      quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified by genome wide association studies 
      and co-located with QTLs of transpiration and biomass. Light, vapour pressure 
      deficit, or soil water potential largely accounted for the differences in allelic 
      effects between experiments, thereby providing strong hypotheses for mechanisms 
      of stomatal control and a way to select relevant candidate genes among the 1-19 
      genes harboured by QTLs. The combination of allelic effects, as affected by 
      environmental conditions, accounted for the variability of stomatal conductance 
      across a range of hybrids and environmental conditions. This approach may 
      therefore contribute to genetic analysis and prediction of stomatal control in 
      diverse environments.

TI  - Iterative subtraction facilitates automated, quantitative analysis of multiple 
      pollen tube growth features.
PG  - 45-54
LID - 10.1007/s00497-018-00351-8 [doi]
AB  - In flowering plants, successful reproduction and generation of seed depends on 
      the delivery of immotile sperm to female gametes via the pollen tube. As 
      reproduction in flowering plants is the cornerstone of our agricultural industry, 
      there is a need to uncover the genes, small molecules, and environmental 
      conditions that affect pollen tube growth dynamics. However, methods for 
      measuring pollen tube phenotypes are labor intensive, and suffer from a tradeoff 
      between workload and resolution. To approach these problems, we use an image 
      analysis technique called Automated Stack Iterative Subtraction (ASIST). Our tool 
      converts growing pollen tube tips into closed particles, making the automated 
      simultaneous extraction of multiple pollen tube phenotypes from hundreds of 
      individual cells tractable via existing particle identification technology. Here 
      we use our tool to analyze growth dynamics of pollen tubes in vitro, and semi in 
      vivo. We show that ASIST provides a framework for robust, high throughput 
      analysis of pollen tube growth behaviors in populations of cells, thus 
      facilitating pollen tube phenomics.

TI  - ADH1B: From alcoholism, natural selection, and cancer to the human phenome.
PG  - 113-125
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32523 [doi]
AB  - The ADH1B (Alcohol Dehydrogenase 1B (class I), Beta Polypeptide) gene and its 
      best-known functional alleles, Arg48His (rs1229984, ADH1B*2) and Arg370Cys 
      (rs2066702, ADH1B*3), have been investigated in relation to many phenotypic 
      traits; most frequently including alcohol metabolism and alcohol drinking 
      behaviors, but also human evolution, liver function, cancer, and, recently, the 
      comprehensive human phenome. To understand ADH1B functions and consequences, we 
      provide here a bioinformatic analysis of its gene regulation and molecular 
      functions, literature review of studies focused on this gene, and a discussion 
      regarding future research perspectives. Certain ADH1B alleles have large effects 
      on alcohol metabolism, and this relationship particularly encourages further 
      investigations in relation to alcoholism and alcohol-associated cancer to 
      understand better the mechanisms by which alcohol metabolism contributes to 
      alcohol abuse and carcinogenesis. We also observed that ADH1B has complex 
      mechanisms that regulate its expression across multiple human tissues, and these 
      may be involved in cardiac and metabolic traits. Evolutionary data strongly 
      suggest that the selection signatures at the ADH1B locus are primarily related to 
      effects other than those on alcohol metabolism. This is also supported by the 
      involvement of ADH1B in multiple molecular pathways and by the findings of our 
      recent phenome-wide association study. Accordingly, future studies should also 
      investigate other functions of ADH1B potentially relevant for the human phenome.

AB  - On average less than half of the applied N is captured by crops, thus there is 
      scope and need to improve N uptake in cereals. With nitrate (NO(3)(-)) being the 
      main form of N available to cereal crops there has been a significant global 
      research effort to understand plant NO(3)(-) uptake. Despite this, our knowledge 
      of the NO(3)(-) uptake system is not sufficient to easily target ways to improve 
      NO(3)(-) uptake. Based on this there is an identified need to better understand 
      the NO(3)(-) uptake system and the signalling molecules that modulate it. With 
      strong transcriptional control governing the NO(3)(-) uptake system, we also need 
      new leads for modulating transcription of NO(3)(-) transporter genes.

TI  - Association between completed suicide and bipolar disorder: A systematic review 
      of the literature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Completed suicide is a major cause of death in bipolar disorder (BD) 
      patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to provide an overall review of the 
      existing literature of completed suicide in BD patients, including clinical and 
      genetic data DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic review of English and 
      non-English articles published on MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycInfo and Cochrane database 
      (1970-2017). Additional studies were identified by contacting clinical experts, 
      searching bibliographies, major textbooks and website of World Health 
      Organization. Initially we did a broad search for the association of bipolar 
      disorder and suicide and we were narrowing the search in terms included "bipolar 
      disorder" and "completed suicide". STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria were 
      articles about completed suicide in patients with BD. Articles exclusively 
      focusing on suicide attempts and suicidal behaviour have been excluded. We used 
      PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) 
      consensus for drafting this systematic review. RESULTS: The initial search 
      generated 2806 articles and a total of 61 meeting our inclusion criteria. We 
      reviewed epidemiological data, genetic factors, risk factors and treatment of 
      completed suicide in BD. Suicide rates in BD vary between studies but our 
      analyses show that they are approximately 20-30-fold greater than in general 
      population. The highest risk of successful suicide was observed in BD-II 
      subjects. The heritability of completed suicide is about 40% and some genes 
      related to major neurotransmitter systems have been associated with suicide. 
      Lithium is the only treatment that has shown anti-suicide potential. LIMITATIONS: 
      The most important limitation of the present review is the limited existing 
      literature on completed suicide in BD. CONCLUSIONS: BD patients are at high risk 
      for suicide. It is possible to identify some factors related to completed 
      suicide, such as early onset, family history of suicide among first-degree 
      relatives, previous attempted suicides, comorbidities and treatment. However it 
      is necessary to promote research on this serious health problem.

TI  - Convergent analysis of genome-wide genotyping and transcriptomic data suggests

AB  - Lithium is the mainstay treatment in bipolar disorder (BD) for its effectiveness 
      in the acute phases of illness and in prevention of recurrences. Lithium's 
      mechanism of action is complex, and while it modulates the function of hundreds 
      of molecular targets, most of these effects could be unspecific and not relevant 
      for its clinical efficacy. In this study, we applied an integrated analytical 
      approach using genome-wide expression and genotyping data from BD patients to 
      identify lithium-responsive genes that may serve as biomarkers of its efficacy. 
      To this purpose, we tested the effect of treatment with lithium chloride 1 mM on 
      the transcriptome of lymphoblasts from 10 lithium responders (LR) and 10 
      nonresponders (NR) patients and identified genes significantly influenced by the 
      treatment exclusively in LR. These findings were integrated with gene-based 
      analysis on genome-wide genotyping data from an extended sample of 205 BD 
      patients characterized for lithium response. The expression of 29 genes was 
      significantly changed by lithium exclusively in LR. Gene-based analysis showed 
      that two of these genes, zinc finger protein 429 (ZNF429) and zinc finger protein 
      493 (ZNF493), were also significantly associated with lithium response. 
      Validation with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed the 
      lithium-induced downregulation of ZNF493 in LR (p = .036). Using convergent 
      analyses of genome-wide expression and genotyping data, we identified ZNF493 as a 
      potential lithium-responsive target that may be involved in modulating lithium 
      efficacy in BD. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence supporting the 
      involvement of zinc finger proteins in lithium response.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common and disabling psychiatric condition with a 
      severe socioeconomic impact. BD is treated with mood stabilizers, among which 
      lithium represents the first-line treatment. Lithium alone or in combination is 
      effective in 60% of chronically treated patients, but response 
      remains heterogenous and a large number of patients require a change in therapy 
      after several weeks or months. Many studies have so far tried to identify 
      molecular and genetic markers that could help us to predict response to mood 
      stabilizers or the risk for adverse drug reactions. Pharmacogenetic studies in 
      BD have been for the most part focused on lithium, but the complexity and 
      variability of the response phenotype, together with the unclear mechanism of 
      action of lithium, limited the power of these studies to identify robust 
      biomarkers. Recent pharmacogenomic studies on lithium response have provided 
      promising findings, suggesting that the integration of genome-wide investigations 
      with deep phenotyping, in silico analyses and machine learning could lead us 
      closer to personalized treatments for BD. Nevertheless, to date none of the genes 
      suggested by pharmacogenetic studies on mood stabilizers have been included in 
      any of the genetic tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
      drug efficacy. On the other hand, genetic information has been included in drug 
      labels to test for the safety of carbamazepine and valproate. In this review, we 
      will outline available studies investigating the pharmacogenetics and 
      pharmacogenomics of lithium and other mood stabilizers, with a specific focus on 
      the limitations of these studies and potential strategies to overcome them. We 
      will also discuss FDA-approved pharmacogenetic tests for treatments commonly used 
      in the management of BD.

TI  - An Updated Taxonomy and a Graphical Summary Tool for Optimal Classification and 
      Comprehension of Omics Research.

LID - 10.1089/omi.2017.0186 [doi]
AB  - The volume of publications and the type of research approaches used in omics 
      system sciences are vast and continue to expand rapidly. This increased 
      complexity and heterogeneity of omics data are challenging data extraction, 
      sensemaking, analyses, knowledge translation, and interpretation. An extended and 
      dynamic taxonomy for the classification and summary of omics studies are 
      essential. We present an updated taxonomy for classification of omics research 
      studies based on four criteria: (1) type and number of genomic loci in a research 
      study, (2) number of species and biological samples, (3) the type of omics 
      technology (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) and omics technology 
      application type (e.g., pharmacogenomics and nutrigenomics), and (4) phenotypes. 
      In addition, we present a graphical summary approach that enables the researchers 
      to define the main characteristics of their study in a single figure, and offers 
      the readers to rapidly grasp the published study and omics data. We searched the 
      PubMed and the Web of Science from 09/2002 to 02/2018, including research and 
      review articles, and identified 90 scientific publications. We propose a call 
      toward omics studies' standardization for reporting in scientific literature. We 
      anticipate the proposed classification scheme will usefully contribute to 
      improved classification of published reports in genomics and other omics fields, 
      and help data extraction from publications for future multiomics data 
      integration.

AB  - We have developed a cell-based phenotypic automated high-content screening 
      approach for N2a cells expressing the pro-aggregant repeat domain of tau protein 
      (tau(RDΔK)), which allows analysis of a chemogenomic library of 1649 compounds 
      for their effect on the inhibition or stimulation of intracellular tau 
      aggregation. We identified several inhibitors and stimulators of aggregation and 
      achieved a screening reproducibility >85% for all data. We identified 18 
      potential inhibitors (= 1.1% of the library) and 10 stimulators (= 0.6% of the 
      library) of tau aggregation in this cell model of tau pathology. The results 
      provide insights into the regulation of cellular tau aggregation and the pathways 
      involved in this process (e.g., involving signaling via p38 mitogen-activated 
      protein kinase, histone deacetylases, vascular endothelial growth factor, 
      rho/ROCK). For example, inhibitors of protein kinases (e.g., p38) can reduce tau 
      aggregation, whereas inhibitors of deacetylases (histone deacetylases) can 
      enhance aggregation. These observations are compatible with reports that 
      phosphorylated or acetylated tau promotes pathology.

TI  - Neutrophil chemotaxis.
PG  - 425-436
LID - 10.1007/s00441-017-2776-8 [doi]
AB  - Neutrophils are the primary cells recruited to inflamed sites during an innate 
      immune response to tissue damage and/or infection. They are finely sensitive to 
      inciting stimuli to reach in great numbers and within minutes areas of 
      inflammation and tissue insult. For this effective response, they can detect 
      extracellular chemical gradients and move towards higher concentrations, the 
      so-called chemotaxis process or guided cell migration. This directed neutrophil 
      recruitment is orchestrated by chemoattractants, a chemically diverse group of 
      molecular guidance cues (e.g., lipids, N-formylated peptides, complement, 
      anaphylotoxins and chemokines). Neutrophils respond to these guidance signals in 
      a hierarchical manner and, based on this concept, they can be further subdivided 
      into two groups: "end target" and "intermediary" chemoattractants, the signals of 
      the former dominant over the latter. Neutrophil chemoattractants exert their 
      effects through interaction with heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 
      expressed on cell surfaces and the chemotactic response is mainly regulated by 
      the Rho family of GTPases. Additionally, neutrophil behavior might differ and be 
      affected in different complex scenarios such as disease conditions and type of 
      vascular bed in specific organs. Finally, there are different mechanisms to 
      disrupt neutrophil chemotaxis either associated to the resolution of inflammation 
      or to bacterial escape and systemic infection. Therefore, in the present review, 
      we will discuss the different molecular players involved in neutrophil 
      chemotaxis, paying special attention to the different chemoattractants described 
      and the way that they interact intra- and extravascularly for neutrophils to 
      properly reach the target tissue.

TI  - Patterns of differential gene expression in a cellular model of human islet 
      development, and relationship to type 2 diabetes predisposition.
PG  - 1614-1622
LID - 10.1007/s00125-018-4612-4 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Most type 2 diabetes-associated genetic variants identified via 
      genome-wide association studies (GWASs) appear to act via the pancreatic islet. 
      Observed defects in insulin secretion could result from an impact of these 
      variants on islet development and/or the function of mature islets. Most 
      functional studies have focused on the latter, given limitations regarding access 
      to human fetal islet tissue. Capitalising upon advances in in vitro 
      differentiation, we characterised the transcriptomes of human induced pluripotent 
      stem cell (iPSC) lines differentiated along the pancreatic endocrine lineage, and 
      explored the contribution of altered islet development to the pathogenesis of 
      type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We performed whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing of 
      human iPSC lines from three independent donors, at baseline and at seven 
      subsequent stages during in vitro islet differentiation. Differentially expressed 
      genes (q < 0.01, log(2) fold change [FC] > 1) were assigned to the stages at 
      which they were most markedly upregulated. We used these data to characterise 
      upstream transcription factors directing different stages of development, and to 
      explore the relationship between RNA expression profiles and genes mapping to 
      type 2 diabetes GWAS signals. RESULTS: We identified 9409 differentially 
      expressed genes across all stages, including many known markers of islet 
      development. Integration of differential expression data with information on 
      transcription factor motifs highlighted the potential contribution of REST to 
      islet development. Over 70% of genes mapping within type 2 diabetes-associated 
      credible intervals showed peak differential expression during islet development, 
      and type 2 diabetes GWAS loci of largest effect (including TCF7L2; 
      log(2)FC = 1.2; q = 8.5 × 10(-10)) were notably enriched in genes differentially 
      expressed at the posterior foregut stage (q = 0.002), as calculated by gene set 
      enrichment analyses. In a complementary analysis of enrichment, genes 
      differentially expressed in the final, beta-like cell stage of in vitro 
      differentiation were significantly enriched (hypergeometric test, permuted p 
      value <0.05) for genes within the credible intervals of type 2 diabetes GWAS 
      loci. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present study characterises RNA expression 
      profiles during human islet differentiation, identifies potential transcriptional 
      regulators of the differentiation process, and suggests that the inherited 
      predisposition to type 2 diabetes is partly mediated through modulation of islet 
      development. DATA AVAILABILITY: Sequence data for this study has been deposited 
      at the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA), under accession number 
      EGAS00001002721.

TI  - Does cross-generational epigenetic inheritance contribute to cultural continuity?
PG  - dvy004
LID - 10.1093/eep/dvy004 [doi]
LID - dvy004
AB  - Human studies of cross-generational epigenetic inheritance have to consider 
      confounding by social patterning down the generations, often referred to as 
      'cultural inheritance'. This raises the question to what extent is 'cultural 
      inheritance' itself epigenetically mediated rather than just learnt. Human 
      studies of non-genetic inheritance have demonstrated that, beyond foetal life, 
      experiences occurring in mid-childhood before puberty are the most likely to be 
      associated with cross-generational responses in the next generation(s). It is 
      proposed that cultural continuity is played out along the axis, or 'payoff', 
      between responsiveness and stability. During the formative years of childhood a 
      stable family and/or home permits small children to explore and thereby learn. To 
      counter disruptions to this family home ideal, cultural institutions such as 
      local schools, religious centres and market places emerged to provide ongoing 
      stability, holding the received wisdom of the past in an accessible state. This 
      cultural support allows the growing child to freely indulge their responsiveness. 
      Some of these prepubertal experiences induce epigenetic responses that also 
      transfer molecular signals to the gametes through which they contribute to the 
      conception of future offspring. In parallel co-evolution with growing cultural 
      support for increasing responsiveness, 'runaway' responsiveness is countered by 
      the positive selection of genetic variants that dampen responsiveness. Testing 
      these ideas within longitudinal multigenerational cohorts will need information 
      on ancestors/parents' own communities and experiences (Exposome scans) linked to 
      ongoing Phenome scans on grandchildren; coupled with epigenome analysis, 
      metastable epialleles and DNA methylation age. Interactions with genetic variants 
      affecting responsiveness should help inform the broad hypothesis.

TI  - Wine yeast phenomics: A standardized fermentation method for assessing 
      quantitative traits of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains in enological conditions.
PG  - e0190094
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0190094 [doi]
LID - e0190094
AB  - This work describes the set up of a small scale fermentation methodology for 
      measuring quantitative traits of hundreds of samples in an enological context. By 
      using standardized screw cap vessels, the alcoholic fermentation kinetics of 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were measured by following their weight loss 
      over the time. This dispositive was coupled with robotized enzymatic assays for 
      measuring metabolites of enological interest in natural grape juices. Despite the 
      small volume used, kinetic parameters and fermentation end products measured are 
      similar with those observed in larger scale vats. The vessel used also offers the 
      possibility to assay 32 volatiles compounds using a headspace solid-phase 
      micro-extraction coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The vessel 
      shaking applied strongly impacted most of the phenotypes investigated due to 
      oxygen transfer occuring in the first hours of the alcoholic fermentation. The 
      impact of grape must and micro-oxygenation was investigated illustrating some 
      relevant genetic x environmental interactions. By phenotyping a wide panel of 
      commercial wine starters in five grape juices, broad phenotypic correlations 
      between kinetics and metabolic end products were evidentiated. Moreover, a 
      multivariate analysis illustrates that some grape musts are more able than others 
      to discriminate commercial strains since some are less robust to environmental 
      changes.

TI  - Multiomics Data Triangulation for Asthma Candidate Biomarkers and Precision 
      Medicine.
PG  - 392-409
LID - 10.1089/omi.2018.0036 [doi]
AB  - Asthma is a common complex disorder and has been subject to intensive omics 
      research for disease susceptibility and therapeutic innovation. Candidate 
      biomarkers of asthma and its precision treatment demand that they stand the test 
      of multiomics data triangulation before they can be prioritized for clinical 
      applications. We classified the biomarkers of asthma after a search of the 
      literature and based on whether or not a given biomarker candidate is reported in 
      multiple omics platforms and methodologies, using PubMed and Web of Science, we 
      identified omics studies of asthma conducted on diverse platforms using keywords, 
      such as asthma, genomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics. We extracted data about 
      asthma candidate biomarkers from 73 articles and developed a catalog of 190 
      potential asthma biomarkers (167 human, 23 animal data), comprising DNA loci, 
      transcripts, proteins, metabolites, epimutations, and noncoding RNAs. The data 
      were sorted according to 13 omics types: genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, 
      proteomics, interactomics, metabolomics, ncRNAomics, glycomics, lipidomics, 
      environmental omics, pharmacogenomics, phenomics, and integrative omics. 
      Importantly, we found that 10 candidate biomarkers were apparent in at least two 
      or more omics levels, thus promising potential for further biomarker research and 
      development and precision medicine applications. This multiomics catalog reported 
      herein for the first time contributes to future decision-making on prioritization 
      of biomarkers and validation efforts for precision medicine in asthma. The 
      findings may also facilitate meta-analyses and integrative omics studies in the 
      future.

TI  - Heterogeneity of asthma and the risk of celiac disease in children.
PG  - 51-58
LID - 10.2500/aap.2018.39.4100 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR and HLA-DQ genes and gluten 
      play crucial roles in developing celiac disease (CD), most patients with these 
      risk factors still do not develop CD, which indicates additional unrecognized 
      risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between asthma and the risk 
      of CD in children. METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective 
      case-control study in children who resided in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We 
      identified children with CD (cases) between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 
      2014, and compared these with children without CD (controls) (1:2 matching). 
      Asthma status was ascertained by using the predetermined asthma criteria (PAC) 
      and the asthma predictive index (API). Data analysis included conditional 
      logistic regression models and an unsupervised network analysis by using an 
      independent phenome-wide association scan (PheWAS) data set. RESULTS: Although 
      asthma status as determined by using PAC was not associated with the risk of CD 
      (odds ratio [OR] 1.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.8-2.5]; p = 0.2), asthma 
      status by using the API was significantly associated (OR 2.8 [95% CI, 1.3-6.0]; p 
      = 0.008). A subgroup analysis indicated that children with both asthma as 
      determined by using PAC and a family history of asthma had an increased risk of 
      CD compared with those without asthma (OR 2.28 [95% CI, 1.11-4.67]; p = 0.024). 
      PheWAS data showed a cluster of asthma single nucleotide polymorphisms and 
      patients with CD. CONCLUSION: A subgroup of children with asthma who also had a 
      family history of asthma seemed to be at an increased risk of CD, and, thus, the 
      third factor that underlies the risk of CD might be related to genetic factors 
      for asthma. Heterogeneity of asthma plays a role in determining the risk of 
      asthma-related comorbidity.

TI  - A Low Rank Model for Phenotype Imputation in Autism Spectrum Disorder.
PG  - 178-187
AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder is a highly heterogeneous condition currently diagnosed 
      using behavioral symptoms. A better understanding of the phenotypic subtypes of 
      autism is a necessary component of the larger goal of mapping autism genotype to 
      phenotype. However, as with most clinical records describing human disease, the 
      phenotypic data available for autism contains varying levels of noise and 
      incompleteness that complicate analysis. Here we analyze behavioral data from 
      16,291 subjects using 250 items from three gold standard diagnostic instruments. 
      We apply a low-rank model to impute missing entries and entire missing 
      instruments with high fidelity, showing that we can complete clinical records for 
      all subjects. Finally, we analyze the low-rank representation of our subjects to 
      identify plausible subtypes of autism, setting the stage for genome-to-phenome 
      prediction experiments. These procedures can be adapted and used with other 
      similarly structured clinical records to enable a more complete mapping between 
      genome and phenome.

AB  - Genomics designates the coordinated investigation of a large number of genes in 
      the context of a biological process or disease. It may be long before we attain 
      comprehensive understanding of the genomics of common complex cardiovascular 
      diseases (CVDs) such as inherited cardiomyopathies, valvular diseases, primary 
      arrhythmogenic conditions, congenital heart syndromes, hypercholesterolemia and 
      atherosclerotic heart disease, hypertensive syndromes, and heart failure with 
      preserved/reduced ejection fraction. Nonetheless, as genomics is evolving 
      rapidly, it is constructive to survey now pertinent concepts and breakthroughs. 
      Today, clinical multimodal electronic medical/health records (EMRs/EHRs) 
      incorporating genomic information establish a continuously-learning, vast 
      knowledge-network with seamless cycling between clinical application and 
      research. It can inform insights into specific pathogenetic pathways, guide 
      biomarker-assisted precise diagnoses and individualized treatments, and stratify 
      prognoses. Complex CVDs blend multiple interacting genomic variants, epigenetics, 
      and environmental risk-factors, engendering progressions of multifaceted 
      disease-manifestations, including clinical symptoms and signs. There is no 
      straight-line linkage between genetic cause(s) or causal gene-variant(s) and 
      disease phenotype(s). Because of interactions involving modifier-gene influences, 
      (micro)-environmental, and epigenetic effects, the same variant may actually 
      produce dissimilar abnormalities in different individuals. Implementing 
      genome-driven personalized cardiology in clinical practice reveals that the study 
      of CVDs at the level of molecules and cells can yield crucial clinical benefits. 
      Complementing evidence-based medicine guidelines from large ("one-size fits all") 
      randomized controlled trials, genomics-based personalized or precision cardiology 
      is a most-creditable paradigm: It provides customizable approaches to prevent, 
      diagnose, and manage CVDs with treatments directly/precisely aimed at causal 
      defects identified by high-throughput genomic technologies. They encompass stem 
      cell and gene therapies exploiting CRISPR-Cas9-gene-editing, and 
      metabolomic-pharmacogenomic therapeutic modalities, precisely fine-tuned for the 
      individual patient. Following the Human Genome Project, many expected genomics 
      technology to provide imminent solutions to intractable medical problems, 
      including CVDs. This eagerness has reaped some disappointment that advances have 
      not yet materialized to the degree anticipated. Undoubtedly, personalized 
      genetic/genomics testing is an emergent technology that should not be applied 
      without supplementary phenotypic/clinical information: Genotype≠Phenotype. 
      However, forthcoming advances in genomics will naturally build on prior 
      attainments and, combined with insights into relevant epigenetics and 
      environmental factors, can plausibly eradicate intractable CVDs, improving human 
      health and well-being.

TI  - Genetics of Lithium Response in Bipolar Disorder.
PG  - 206-211
LID - 10.1055/a-0590-4992 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lithium remains the best-established long-term treatment for 
      bipolar disorder because of its efficacy in maintaining periods of remission and 
      reducing the risk of suicide. Not all patients successfully respond to lithium 
      treatment, and the individual response, including the occurrence of side effects, 
      is highly variable and not easy to predict. The genetic basis of lithium response 
      is supported by the fact that the response clusters in families. Likewise, recent 
      high-throughput genomic analyses have shed light on its genetic architecture. 
      METHODS: This nonsystematic review summarizes the main results obtained in 
      genetic association studies using lithium response as target trait. RESULTS: 
      These studies suggest that several genetic loci might modulate the way a patient 
      responds to lithium maintenance treatment. Further studies to fully characterize 
      the genetic architecture of lithium response are warranted. DISCUSSION: The 
      identification of genetic factors associated with lithium response will be 
      important for (1) better understanding of lithium's mode of action and (2) 
      development of a predictive model for optimization of long-term treatment of 
      bipolar disorder.

AB  - Genome scale modeling (GSM) predicts the performance of microbial workhorses and 
      helps identify beneficial gene targets. GSM integrated with intracellular flux 
      dynamics, omics, and thermodynamics have shown remarkable progress in both 
      elucidating complex cellular phenomena and computational strain design (CSD). 
      Nonetheless, these models still show high uncertainty due to a poor understanding 
      of innate pathway regulations, metabolic burdens, and other factors (such as 
      stress tolerance and metabolite channeling). Besides, the engineered hosts may 
      have genetic mutations or non-genetic variations in bioreactor conditions and 
      thus CSD rarely foresees fermentation rate and titer. Metabolic models play 
      important role in design-build-test-learn cycles for strain improvement, and 
      machine learning (ML) may provide a viable complementary approach for driving 
      strain design and deciphering cellular processes. In order to develop quality ML 
      models, knowledge engineering leverages and standardizes the wealth of 
      information in literature (e.g., genomic/phenomic data, synthetic biology 
      strategies, and bioprocess variables). Data driven frameworks can offer new 
      constraints for mechanistic models to describe cellular regulations, to design 
      pathways, to search gene targets, and to estimate fermentation titer/rate/yield 
      under specified growth conditions (e.g., mixing, nutrients, and O(2)). This 
      review highlights the scope of information collections, database constructions, 
      and machine learning techniques (such as deep learning and transfer learning), 
      which may facilitate "Learn and Design" for strain development.

TI  - Return of individual results in epilepsy genomic research: A view from the field.
PG  - 1635-1642
LID - 10.1111/epi.14530 [doi]
AB  - Genomic findings are emerging rapidly in 2 large, closely related epilepsy 
      research consortia: the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project and Epi4K. Disclosure of 
      individual results to participants in genomic research is increasingly viewed as 
      an ethical obligation, but strategies for return of results were not included in 
      the design of these consortia, raising complexities in establishing criteria for 
      which results to offer, determining participant preferences, managing the large 
      number of sites involved, and covering associated costs. Here, we describe the 
      challenges faced, alternative approaches considered, and progress to date. 
      Experience from these 2 consortia illustrates the importance, for genomic 
      research in epilepsy and other disorders, of including a specific plan for return 
      of results in the study design, with financial support for obtaining clinical 
      confirmation and providing ongoing support for participants. Participant 
      preferences for return of results should be established at the time of 
      enrollment, and methods for allowing future contacts with participants should be 
      included. In addition, methods should be developed for summarizing meaningful, 
      comprehensible information about findings in the aggregate that participants can 
      access in an ongoing way.

TI  - Crowds Replicate Performance of Scientific Experts Scoring Phylogenetic Matrices 
      of Phenotypes.
PG  - 49-60
LID - 10.1093/sysbio/syx052 [doi]
AB  - Scientists building the Tree of Life face an overwhelming challenge to categorize 
      phenotypes (e.g., anatomy, physiology) from millions of living and fossil 
      species. This biodiversity challenge far outstrips the capacities of trained 
      scientific experts. Here we explore whether crowdsourcing can be used to collect 
      matrix data on a large scale with the participation of nonexpert students, or 
      "citizen scientists." Crowdsourcing, or data collection by nonexperts, frequently 
      via the internet, has enabled scientists to tackle some large-scale data 
      collection challenges too massive for individuals or scientific teams alone. The 
      quality of work by nonexpert crowds is, however, often questioned and little data 
      have been collected on how such crowds perform on complex tasks such as 
      phylogenetic character coding. We studied a crowd of over 600 nonexperts and 
      found that they could use images to identify anatomical similarity (hypotheses of 
      homology) with an average accuracy of 82% compared with scores provided by 
      experts in the field. This performance pattern held across the Tree of Life, from 
      protists to vertebrates. We introduce a procedure that predicts the difficulty of 
      each character and that can be used to assign harder characters to experts and 
      easier characters to a nonexpert crowd for scoring. We test this procedure in a 
      controlled experiment comparing crowd scores to those of experts and show that 
      crowds can produce matrices with over 90% of cells scored correctly while 
      reducing the number of cells to be scored by experts by 50%. Preparation time, 
      including image collection and processing, for a crowdsourcing experiment is 
      significant, and does not currently save time of scientific experts overall. 
      However, if innovations in automation or robotics can reduce such effort, then 
      large-scale implementation of our method could greatly increase the collective 
      scientific knowledge of species phenotypes for phylogenetic tree building. For 
      the field of crowdsourcing, we provide a rare study with ground truth, or an 
      experimental control that many studies lack, and contribute new methods on how to 
      coordinate the work of experts and nonexperts. We show that there are important 
      instances in which crowd consensus is not a good proxy for correctness.

TI  - What Should a Psychiatrist Know About Genetics? Review and Recommendations From 
      the Residency Education Committee of the International Society of Psychiatric 
      Genetics.
LID - 17nr12046 [pii]
LID - 10.4088/JCP.17nr12046 [doi]
AB  - The International Society of Psychiatric Genetics (ISPG) created a Residency 
      Education Committee with the purpose of identifying key genetic knowledge that 
      should be taught in psychiatric training programs. Thirteen committee members 
      were appointed by the ISPG Board of Directors, based on varied training, 
      expertise, gender, and national origin. The Committee has met quarterly for the 
      past 2 years, with periodic reports to the Board and to the members of the 
      Society. The information summarized includes the existing literature in the field 
      of psychiatric genetics and the output of ongoing large genomics consortia. An 
      outline of clinically relevant areas of genetic knowledge was developed, 
      circulated, and approved. This document was expanded and annotated with 
      appropriate references, and the manuscript was developed. Specific information 
      regarding the contribution of common and rare genetic variants to major 
      psychiatric disorders and treatment response is now available. Current challenges 
      include the following: (1) Genetic testing is recommended in the evaluation of 
      autism and intellectual disability, but its use is limited in current clinical 
      practice. (2) Commercial pharmacogenomic testing is widely available, but its 
      utility has not yet been clearly established. (3) Other methods, such as whole 
      exome and whole genome sequencing, will soon be clinically applicable. The need 
      for informed genetic counseling in psychiatry is greater than ever before, 
      knowledge in the field is rapidly growing, and genetic education should become an 
      integral part of psychiatric training.

PG  - 107-127
LID - 10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010818-021315 [doi]
AB  - Derived from the term exposure, the exposome is an omic-scale characterization of 
      the nongenetic drivers of health and disease. With the genome, it defines the 
      phenome of an individual. The measurement of complex environmental factors that 
      exert pressure on our health has not kept pace with genomics and historically has 
      not provided a similar level of resolution. Emerging technologies make it 
      possible to obtain detailed information on drugs, toxicants, pollutants, 
      nutrients, and physical and psychological stressors on an omic scale. These 
      forces can also be assessed at systems and network levels, providing a framework 
      for advances in pharmacology and toxicology. The exposome paradigm can improve 
      the analysis of drug interactions and detection of adverse effects of drugs and 
      toxicants and provide data on biological responses to exposures. The 
      comprehensive model can provide data at the individual level for precision 
      medicine, group level for clinical trials, and population level for public 
      health.

TI  - Automated phenotyping for early vigour of field pea seedlings in controlled 
      environment by colour imaging technology.
PG  - e0207788
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0207788 [doi]
LID - e0207788
AB  - Early vigour of seedlings is a beneficial trait of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) 
      that contributes to weed control, water use efficiency and is likely to 
      contribute to yield under certain environments. Although breeding is considered 
      the most effective approach to improve early vigour of field pea, the absence of 
      a robust and high-throughput phenotyping tool to dissect this complex trait is 
      currently a major obstacle of genetic improvement programs to address this issue. 
      To develop this tool, separate trials on 44 genetically diverse field pea 
      genotypes were conducted in the automated plant phenotyping platform of Plant 
      Phenomics Victoria, Horsham and in the field, respectively. High correlation 
      between estimated plant parameters derived from the automated phenotyping 
      platform and important early vigour traits such as shoot biomass, leaf area and 
      plant height indicated that the derived plant parameters can be used to predict 
      vigour traits in field pea seedlings. Plant growth analysis demonstrated that the 
      "broken-stick" model fitted well with the growth pattern of all field pea 
      genotypes and can be used to determine the linear growth phase. Further analysis 
      suggested that the estimated plant parameters collected at the linear growth 
      phase can effectively differentiate early vigour across field pea genotypes. High 
      correlation between normalised difference vegetation indices captured from the 
      field trial and estimated shoot biomass and top-view area confirmed the 
      consistent performance of early vigour field pea genotypes under controlled and 
      field environments. Overall, our results demonstrated that this robust screening 
      tool is highly applicable and will enable breeding programs to rapidly identify 
      early vigour traits and utilise germplasm to contribute to the genetic 
      improvement of field peas.

TI  - Dealing with multi-source and multi-scale information in plant phenomics: the 
      ontology-driven Phenotyping Hybrid Information System.
PG  - 588-601
LID - 10.1111/nph.15385 [doi]
AB  - Phenomic datasets need to be accessible to the scientific community. Their 
      reanalysis requires tracing relevant information on thousands of plants, sensors 
      and events. The open-source Phenotyping Hybrid Information System (PHIS) is 
      proposed for plant phenotyping experiments in various categories of installations 
      (field, glasshouse). It unambiguously identifies all objects and traits in an 
      experiment and establishes their relations via ontologies and semantics that 
      apply to both field and controlled conditions. For instance, the genotype is 
      declared for a plant or plot and is associated with all objects related to it. 
      Events such as successive plant positions, anomalies and annotations are 
      associated with objects so they can be easily retrieved. Its ontology-driven 
      architecture is a powerful tool for integrating and managing data from multiple 
      experiments and platforms, for creating relationships between objects and 
      enriching datasets with knowledge and metadata. It interoperates with external 
      resources via web services, thereby allowing data integration into other systems; 
      for example, modelling platforms or external databases. It has the potential for 
      rapid diffusion because of its ability to integrate, manage and visualize 
      multi-source and multi-scale data, but also because it is based on 10 yr of trial 
      and error in our groups.

AB  - Shotgun metagenomics, which allows for broad sampling of viral diversity, has 
      uncovered genes that are widely distributed among virioplankton populations and 
      show linkages to important biological features of unknown viruses. Over 25% of 
      known dsDNA phage carry the DNA polymerase I (polA) gene, making it one of the 
      most widely distributed phage genes. Because of its pivotal role in DNA 
      replication, this enzyme is linked to phage lifecycle characteristics. Previous 
      research has suggested that a single amino acid substitution might be predictive 
      of viral lifestyle. In this study Chesapeake Bay virioplankton were sampled by 
      shotgun metagenomic sequencing (using long and short read technologies). More 
      polA sequences were predicted from this single viral metagenome (virome) than 
      from 86 globally distributed virome libraries (ca. 2,100, and 1,200, 
      respectively). The PolA peptides predicted from the Chesapeake Bay virome 
      clustered with 69% of PolA peptides from global viromes; thus, remarkably the 
      Chesapeake Bay virome captured the majority of known PolA peptide diversity in 
      viruses. This deeply sequenced virome also expanded the diversity of PolA 
      sequences, increasing the number of PolA clusters by 44%. Contigs containing polA 
      sequences were also used to examine relationships between phylogenetic clades of 
      PolA and other genes within unknown viral populations. Phylogenic analysis 
      revealed five distinct groups of phages distinguished by the amino acids at their 
      762 (Escherichia coli IAI39 numbering) positions and replication genes. DNA 
      polymerase I sequences from Tyr762 and Phe762 groups were most often neighbored 
      by ring-shaped superfamily IV helicases and ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs). The 
      Leu762 groups had non-ring shaped helicases from superfamily II and were further 
      distinguished by an additional helicase gene from superfamily I and the lack of 
      any identifiable RNR genes. Moreover, we found that the inclusion of 
      ribonucleotide reductase associated with PolA helped to further differentiate 
      phage diversity, chiefly within lytic podovirus populations. Altogether, these 
      data show that DNA Polymerase I is a useful marker for observing the diversity 
      and composition of the virioplankton and may be a driving factor in the 
      divergence of phage replication components.

TI  - Using a novel computational drug-repositioning approach (DrugPredict) to rapidly 
      identify potent drug candidates for cancer treatment.
PG  - 403-414
LID - 10.1038/onc.2017.328 [doi]
AB  - Computation-based drug-repurposing/repositioning approaches can greatly speed up 
      the traditional drug discovery process. To date, systematic and comprehensive 
      computation-based approaches to identify and validate drug-repositioning 
      candidates for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) have not been undertaken. Here, we 
      present a novel drug discovery strategy that combines a computational 
      drug-repositioning system (DrugPredict) with biological testing in cell lines in 
      order to rapidly identify novel drug candidates for EOC. DrugPredict exploited 
      unique repositioning opportunities rendered by a vast amount of disease genomics, 
      phenomics, drug treatment, and genetic pathway and uniquely revealed that 
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) rank just as high as currently used 
      ovarian cancer drugs. As epidemiological studies have reported decreased 
      incidence of ovarian cancer associated with regular intake of NSAIDs, we assessed 
      whether NSAIDs could have chemoadjuvant applications in EOC and found that (i) 
      NSAID Indomethacin induces robust cell death in primary patient-derived 
      platinum-sensitive and platinum- resistant ovarian cancer cells and ovarian 
      cancer stem cells and (ii) downregulation of β-catenin is partially driving 
      effects of Indomethacin in cisplatin-resistant cells. In summary, we demonstrate 
      that DrugPredict represents an innovative computational drug- discovery strategy 
      to uncover drugs that are routinely used for other indications that could be 
      effective in treating various cancers, thus introducing a potentially rapid and 
      cost-effective translational opportunity. As NSAIDs are already in routine use in 
      gynecological treatment regimens and have acceptable safety profile, our results 
      will provide with a rationale for testing NSAIDs as potential chemoadjuvants in 
      EOC patient trials.

AB  - In orchards, measuring crown characteristics is essential for monitoring the 
      dynamics of tree growth and optimizing farm management. However, it lacks a rapid 
      and reliable method of extracting the features of trees with an irregular crown 
      shape such as trained peach trees. Here, we propose an efficient method of 
      segmenting the individual trees and measuring the crown width and crown 
      projection area (CPA) of peach trees with time-series information, based on 
      gathered images. The images of peach trees were collected by unmanned aerial 
      vehicles in an orchard in Okayama, Japan, and then the digital surface model was 
      generated by using a Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) 
      based software. After individual trees were identified through the use of an 
      adaptive threshold and marker-controlled watershed segmentation in the digital 
      surface model, the crown widths and CPA were calculated, and the accuracy was 
      evaluated against manual delineation and field measurement, respectively. Taking 
      manual delineation of 12 trees as reference, the root-mean-square errors of the 
      proposed method were 0.08 m (R (2) = 0.99) and 0.15 m (R (2) = 0.93) for the two 
      orthogonal crown widths, and 3.87 m(2) for CPA (R (2) = 0.89), while those taking 
      field measurement of 44 trees as reference were 0.47 m (R (2) = 0.91), 0.51 m (R 
      (2) = 0.74), and 4.96 m(2) (R (2) = 0.88). The change of growth rate of CPA 
      showed that the peach trees grew faster from May to July than from July to 
      September, with a wide variation in relative growth rates among trees. Not only 
      can this method save labour by replacing field measurement, but also it can allow 
      farmers to monitor the growth of orchard trees dynamically.

TI  - Measuring the dynamic photosynthome.
PG  - 207-220
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcy087 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Photosynthesis underpins plant productivity and yet is notoriously 
      sensitive to small changes in environmental conditions, meaning that quantitation 
      in nature across different time scales is not straightforward. The 'dynamic' 
      changes in photosynthesis (i.e. the kinetics of the various reactions of 
      photosynthesis in response to environmental shifts) are now known to be important 
      in driving crop yield. SCOPE: It is known that photosynthesis does not respond in 
      a timely manner, and even a small temporal 'mismatch' between a change in the 
      environment and the appropriate response of photosynthesis toward optimality can 
      result in a fall in productivity. Yet the most commonly measured parameters are 
      still made at steady state or a temporary steady state (including those for crop 
      breeding purposes), meaning that new photosynthetic traits remain undiscovered. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There is a great need to understand photosynthesis dynamics from a 
      mechanistic and biological viewpoint especially when applied to the field of 
      'phenomics' which typically uses large genetically diverse populations of plants. 
      Despite huge advances in measurement technology in recent years, it is still 
      unclear whether we possess the capability of capturing and describing the 
      physiologically relevant dynamic features of field photosynthesis in sufficient 
      detail. Such traits are highly complex, hence we dub this the 'photosynthome'. 
      This review sets out the state of play and describes some approaches that could 
      be made to address this challenge with reference to the relevant biological 
      processes involved.

TI  - Biological Processes Modulating Longevity across Primates: A Phylogenetic 
      Genome-Phenome Analysis.

AB  - Aging is a complex process affecting different species and individuals in 
      different ways. Comparing genetic variation across species with their aging 
      phenotypes will help understanding the molecular basis of aging and longevity. 
      Although most studies on aging have so far focused on short-lived model 
      organisms, recent comparisons of genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data 
      across lineages with different lifespans are unveiling molecular signatures 
      associated with longevity. Here, we examine the relationship between genomic 
      variation and maximum lifespan across primate species. We used two different 
      approaches. First, we searched for parallel amino-acid mutations that co-occur 
      with increases in longevity across the primate linage. Twenty-five such 
      amino-acid variants were identified, several of which have been previously 
      reported by studies with different experimental setups and in different model 
      organisms. The genes harboring these mutations are mainly enriched in functional 
      categories such as wound healing, blood coagulation, and cardiovascular 
      disorders. We demonstrate that these pathways are highly enriched for pleiotropic 
      effects, as predicted by the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging. A second 
      approach was focused on changes in rates of protein evolution across the primate 
      phylogeny. Using the phylogenetic generalized least squares, we show that some 
      genes exhibit strong correlations between their evolutionary rates and 
      longevity-associated traits. These include genes in the Sphingosine 1-phosphate 
      pathway, PI3K signaling, and the Thrombin/protease-activated receptor pathway, 
      among other cardiovascular processes. Together, these results shed light into 
      human senescence patterns and underscore the power of comparative genomics to 
      identify pathways related to aging and longevity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common and highly heritable disorder of 
      mood. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several independent 
      susceptibility loci. In order to extract more biological information from GWAS 
      data, multi-locus approaches represent powerful tools since they utilize 
      knowledge about biological processes to integrate functional sets of genes at 
      strongly to moderately associated loci. METHODS: We conducted gene set enrichment 
      analyses (GSEA) using 2.3 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms, 397 Reactome 
      pathways and 24,025 patients with BD and controls. RNA expression of implicated 
      individual genes and gene sets were examined in post-mortem brains across 
      lifespan. RESULTS: Two pathways showed a significant enrichment after correction 
      for multiple comparisons in the GSEA: GRB2 events in ERBB2 signaling, for which 6 
      of 21 genes were BD associated (P(FDR) = 0.0377), and NCAM signaling for neurite 
      out-growth, for which 11 out of 62 genes were BD associated (P(FDR) = 0.0451). 
      Most pathway genes showed peaks of RNA co-expression during fetal development and 
      infancy and mapped to neocortical areas and parts of the limbic system. 
      LIMITATIONS: Pathway associations were technically reproduced by two methods, 
      although they were not formally replicated in independent samples. Gene 
      expression was explored in controls but not in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pathway 
      analysis in large GWAS data of BD and follow-up of gene expression patterns in 
      healthy brains provide support for an involvement of neurodevelopmental processes 
      in the etiology of this neuropsychiatric disease. Future studies are required to 
      further evaluate the relevance of the implicated genes on pathway functioning and 
      clinical aspects of BD.

AB  - Squamate reptiles are a major component of vertebrate biodiversity whose 
      crown-clade traces its origin to a narrow window of time in the Mesozoic during 
      which the main subclades diverged in rapid succession. Deciphering phylogenetic 
      relationships among these lineages has proven challenging given the conflicting 
      signals provided by genomic and phenomic data. Most notably, the placement of 
      Iguania has routinely differed between data sources, with morphological evidence 
      supporting a sister relationship to the remaining squamates (Scleroglossa 
      hypothesis) and molecular data favoring a highly nested position alongside snakes 
      and anguimorphs (Toxicofera hypothesis). We provide novel insights by generating 
      an expanded morphological dataset and exploring the presence of phylogenetic 
      signal, noise, and biases in molecular data. Our analyses confirm the presence of 
      strong conflicting signals for the position of Iguania between morphological and 
      molecular datasets. However, we also find that molecular data behave highly 
      erratically when inferring the deepest branches of the squamate tree, a 
      consequence of limited phylogenetic signal to resolve this ancient radiation with 
      confidence. This, in turn, seems to result from a rate of evolution that is too 
      high for historical signals to survive to the present. Finally, we detect 
      significant systematic biases, with iguanians and snakes sharing faster rates of 
      molecular evolution and a similarly biased nucleotide composition. A combination 
      of scant phylogenetic signal, high levels of noise, and the presence of 
      systematic biases could result in the misplacement of Iguania. We regard this 
      explanation to be at least as plausible as the complex scenario of convergence 
      and reversals required for morphological data to be misleading. We further 
      evaluate and discuss the utility of morphological data to resolve ancient 
      radiations, as well as its impact in combined-evidence phylogenomic analyses, 
      with results relevant for the assessment of evidence and conflict across the Tree 
      of Life.

AB  - The ionome is critical for plant growth, productivity, defense, and it eventually 
      affects human food quantity and quality. Located on the leaf surface, stomatal 
      guard cells are critical gatekeepers for water, gas, and pathogens. Insights form 
      ionomics (metallomics) is imperative as we enter an omics-driven systems biology 
      era where an understanding of guard cell function and physiology is advanced 
      through efforts in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. While 
      the roles of major cations (K, Ca) and anions (Cl) are well known in guard cell 
      function, the related physiology, movement and regulation of trace elements, 
      metal ions, and heavy metals are poorly understood. The majority of the 
      information on the role of trace elements in guard cells emanates from classical 
      feeding experiments, field or in vitro fortification, micropropagation, and 
      microscopy studies, while novel insights are available from limited metal ion 
      transporter and ion channel studies. Given the rejuvenated and recent interest in 
      the constantly changing ionome in plant mineral balance and eventually in human 
      nutrition and health, we looked into the far from established guard cell ionome 
      in lieu of the modern omics era of high throughput research endeavors. Newer 
      technologies and tools i.e., high resolution mass spectrometry, advanced imaging, 
      and phenomics are now available to delve into the guard cell ionomes. In this 
      review, research efforts on guard cell ionomes were collated and categorized, and 
      we highlight the underlying role of the largely unknown ionome in guard cell 
      function towards a systems physiology understanding of plant health and 
      productivity.

AB  - With the rapid adoption of high-throughput omic approaches to analyze biological 
      samples such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, each 
      analysis can generate tera- to peta-byte sized data files on a daily basis. These 
      data file sizes, together with differences in nomenclature among these data 
      types, make the integration of these multi-dimensional omics data into 
      biologically meaningful context challenging. Variously named as integrated omics, 
      multi-omics, poly-omics, trans-omics, pan-omics, or shortened to just 'omics', 
      the challenges include differences in data cleaning, normalization, biomolecule 
      identification, data dimensionality reduction, biological contextualization, 
      statistical validation, data storage and handling, sharing, and data archiving. 
      The ultimate goal is towards the holistic realization of a 'systems biology' 
      understanding of the biological question in hand. Commonly used approaches in 
      these efforts are currently limited by the 3 i's - integration, interpretation, 
      and insights. Post integration, these very large datasets aim to yield 
      unprecedented views of cellular systems at exquisite resolution for 
      transformative insights into processes, events, and diseases through various 
      computational and informatics frameworks. With the continued reduction in costs 
      and processing time for sample analyses, and increasing types of omics datasets 
      generated such as glycomics, lipidomics, microbiomics, and phenomics, an 
      increasing number of scientists in this interdisciplinary domain of 
      bioinformatics face these challenges. We discuss recent approaches, existing 
      tools, and potential caveats in the integration of omics datasets for development 
      of standardized analytical pipelines that could be adopted by the global omics 
      research community.

TI  - Association of CETP Gene Variants With Risk for Vascular and Nonvascular Diseases 
      Among Chinese Adults.
PG  - 34-43
LID - 10.1001/jamacardio.2017.4177 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Increasing levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 
      through pharmacologic inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is 
      a potentially important strategy for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular 
      disease (CVD). OBJECTIVE: To use genetic variants in the CETP gene to assess 
      potential risks and benefits of lifelong lower CETP activity on CVD and other 
      outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective biobank study 
      included 151 217 individuals aged 30 to 79 years who were enrolled from 5 urban 
      and 5 rural areas of China from June 25, 2004, through July 15, 2008. All 
      participants had baseline genotype data, 17 854 of whom had lipid measurements 
      and 4657 of whom had lipoprotein particle measurements. Median follow-up of 9.2 
      years (interquartile range, 8.2-10.1 years) was completed January 1, 2016, 
      through linkage to health insurance records and death and disease registries. 
      EXPOSURES: Five CETP variants, including an East Asian loss-of-function variant 
      (rs2303790), combined in a genetic score weighted to associations with HDL 
      cholesterol levels. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Baseline levels of lipids and 
      lipoprotein particles, cardiovascular risk factors, incidence of carotid plaque 
      and predefined major vascular and nonvascular diseases, and a phenome-wide range 
      of diseases. RESULTS: Among the 151 217 individuals included in this study (58.4% 
      women and 41.6% men), the mean (SD) age was 52.3 (10.9) years. Overall, the mean 
      (SD) low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was 91 (27) mg/dL; HDL 
      cholesterol level, 48 (12) mg/dL. CETP variants were strongly associated with 
      higher concentrations of HDL cholesterol (eg, 6.1 [SE, 0.4] mg/dL per rs2303790-G 
      allele; P = 9.4 × 10-47) but were not associated with lower LDL cholesterol 
      levels. Within HDL particles, cholesterol esters were increased and triglycerides 
      reduced, whereas within very low-density lipoprotein particles, cholesterol 
      esters were reduced and triglycerides increased. When scaled to 10-mg/dL higher 
      levels of HDL cholesterol, the CETP genetic score was not associated with 
      occlusive CVD (18 550 events; odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.06), major 
      coronary events (5767 events; OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.95-1.22), myocardial infarction 
      (3118 events; OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.97-1.35), ischemic stroke (13 759 events; OR, 
      0.94; 95% CI, 0.86-1.02), intracerebral hemorrhage (6532 events; OR, 0.94; 95% 
      CI, 0.83-1.06), or other vascular diseases or carotid plaque. Similarly, 
      rs2303790 was not associated with any vascular diseases or plaque. No 
      associations with nonvascular diseases were found other than an increased risk 
      for eye diseases with rs2303790 (4090 events; OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.13-1.80; 
      P = .003). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: CETP variants were associated with altered 
      HDL metabolism but did not lower LDL cholesterol levels and had no significant 
      association with risk for CVD. These results suggest that in the absence of 
      reduced LDL cholesterol levels, increasing HDL cholesterol levels by inhibition 
      of CETP may not confer significant benefits for CVD.

TI  - Software Application Profile: PHESANT: a tool for performing automated phenome 
      scans in UK Biobank.

LID - 10.1093/ije/dyx204 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Epidemiological cohorts typically contain a diverse set of phenotypes 
      such that automation of phenome scans is non-trivial, because they require highly 
      heterogeneous models. For this reason, phenome scans have to date tended to use a 
      smaller homogeneous set of phenotypes that can be analysed in a consistent 
      fashion. We present PHESANT (PHEnome Scan ANalysis Tool), a software package for 
      performing comprehensive phenome scans in UK Biobank. GENERAL FEATURES: PHESANT 
      tests the association of a specified trait with all continuous, integer and 
      categorical variables in UK Biobank, or a specified subset. PHESANT uses a novel 
      rule-based algorithm to determine how to appropriately test each trait, then 
      performs the analyses and produces plots and summary tables. IMPLEMENTATION: The 
      PHESANT phenome scan is implemented in R. PHESANT includes a novel Javascript 
      D3.js visualization and accompanying Java code that converts the phenome scan 
      results to the required JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. AVAILABILITY: 
      PHESANT is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/MRCIEU/PHESANT]. Git tag 
      v0.5 corresponds to the version presented here.

      light interferometry.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Under axisymmetric conditions, changes in the thickness of the thin 
      film between a fluid drop and a solid revealed by white light interferometry can 
      provide information about the interaction of the bodies. Thus, in principle one 
      can quantify the force between the surfaces using interferometric information of 
      film thickness profile. This is needed to quantify and analyze drop-solid 
      interactions across complex fluids such as an ionic liquid to independently 
      characterize new surface forces. EXPERIMENTS: Interferometric fringes were 
      obtained in experiments on the interaction between a mercury drop and mica across 
      a film of room temperature ionic liquid. The data is analyzed using a novel 
      formula giving the total force acting on the drop. The calculations are compared 
      with two other approaches to estimating forces. Qualitative and quantitative 
      differences are discussed. FINDINGS: This is the first report of forces measured 
      between mercury and mica across an ionic liquid. The system is subjected to 
      different applied electric potentials. In each case a long ranged, exponentially 
      decaying repulsive force is found. At small separations, the system becomes 
      unstable and the surfaces jump into contact. The comparison of force calculation 
      methods demonstrates the superiority of the force approach proposed here.

AB  - A simple and accurate closed-form expression for the Hamaker constant that best 
      represents experimental surface force data is presented. Numerical comparisons 
      are made with the current standard least squares approach, which falsely assumes 
      error-free separation measurements, and a nonlinear version assuming independent 
      measurements of force and separation are subject to error. The comparisons 
      demonstrate that not only is the proposed formula easily implemented it is also 
      considerably more accurate. This option is appropriate for any value of Hamaker 
      constant, high or low, and certainly for any interacting system exhibiting an 
      inverse square distance dependent van der Waals force.

TI  - Trait-specific processes of convergence and conservatism shape ecomorphological 
      evolution in ground-dwelling squirrels.
PG  - 473-489
LID - 10.1111/evo.13422 [doi]
AB  - Our understanding of mechanisms operating over deep timescales to shape 
      phenotypic diversity often hinges on linking variation in one or few trait(s) to 
      specific evolutionary processes. When distinct processes are capable of similar 
      phenotypic signatures, however, identifying these drivers is difficult. We 
      explored ecomorphological evolution across a radiation of ground-dwelling 
      squirrels whose history includes convergence and constraint, two processes that 
      can yield similar signatures of standing phenotypic diversity. Using four 
      ecologically relevant trait datasets (body size, cranial, mandibular, and 
      molariform tooth shape), we compared and contrasted variation, covariation, and 
      disparity patterns in a new phylogenetic framework. Strong correlations existed 
      between body size and two skull traits (allometry) and among skull traits 
      themselves (integration). Inferred evolutionary modes were also concordant across 
      traits (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck with two adaptive regimes). However, despite these 
      broad similarities, we found divergent dynamics on the macroevolutionary 
      landscape, with phenotypic disparity being differentially shaped by convergence 
      and conservatism. Such among-trait heterogeneity in process (but not always 
      pattern) reiterates the mosaic nature of morphological evolution, and suggests 
      ground squirrel evolution is poorly captured by single process descriptors. Our 
      results also highlight how use of single traits can bias macroevolutionary 
      inference, affirming the importance of broader trait-bases in understanding 
      phenotypic evolutionary dynamics.

TI  - CRISPR-Cas9 human gene replacement and phenomic characterization in 
      Caenorhabditis elegans to understand the functional conservation of human genes 
      and decipher variants of uncertain significance.
LID - 10.1242/dmm.036517 [doi]
LID - dmm036517
AB  - Our ability to sequence genomes has vastly surpassed our ability to interpret the 
      genetic variation we discover. This presents a major challenge in the clinical 
      setting, where the recent application of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing 
      has uncovered thousands of genetic variants of uncertain significance. Here, we 
      present a strategy for targeted human gene replacement and phenomic 
      characterization, based on CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering in the genetic model 
      organism Caenorhabditis elegans, that will facilitate assessment of the 
      functional conservation of human genes and structure-function analysis of 
      disease-associated variants with unprecedented precision. We validate our 
      strategy by demonstrating that direct single-copy replacement of the C. elegans 
      ortholog (daf-18) with the critical human disease-associated gene phosphatase and 
      tensin homolog (PTEN) is sufficient to rescue multiple phenotypic abnormalities 
      caused by complete deletion of daf-18, including complex chemosensory and 
      mechanosensory impairments. In addition, we used our strategy to generate animals 
      harboring a single copy of the known pathogenic lipid phosphatase inactive PTEN 
      variant (PTEN-G129E), and showed that our automated in vivo phenotypic assays 
      could accurately and efficiently classify this missense variant as loss of 
      function. The integrated nature of the human transgenes allows for analysis of 
      both homozygous and heterozygous variants and greatly facilitates high-throughput 
      precision medicine drug screens. By combining genome engineering with rapid and 
      automated phenotypic characterization, our strategy streamlines the 
      identification of novel conserved gene functions in complex sensory and learning 
      phenotypes that can be used as in vivo functional assays to decipher variants of 
      uncertain significance.

AB  - The development and application of methods for automated behavioral analysis have 
      revolutionized behavioral genetics across model organisms. In this review we 
      summarize the history of automated behavioral analysis in the nematode 
      Caenorhabditis elegans. We highlight recent studies of learning and memory to 
      exemplify just how complex the genetic and neural circuit mechanisms underlying a 
      seemingly simple single behavioral response can be. We finish by looking forward 
      at the exciting prospects of combing genomic technologies with connectomic and 
      phenomic level measurements.

AB  - A recently identified feature of the host response to infection with helminth 
      parasites is suppression of concomitant disease. Dendritic cells (DCs) exposed to 
      antigens from the tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta significantly reduce the severity 
      of dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis in mice. Here we elucidate 
      mechanisms underlying this cellular immunotherapy. We show a requirement for Ccr7 
      expression on transferred H. diminuta antigen-treated (HD)-DCs, suggesting that 
      homing to secondary lymphoid tissues is important for suppression of colitis. 
      Furthermore, sodium metaperiodate-sensitive helminth-derived glycans are required 
      to drive the anti-colitic response in recipient mice. Induction of Th2-type 
      cytokines and Gata-3(+)Cd4(+) cells in secondary lymphoid tissues is dependent on 
      major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) protein expression on 
      transferred DCs, although remarkably, transfer of MHC II(-/-) HD-DCs still 
      attenuated dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis in recipient mice. 
      Moreover, transfer of Cd4(+) splenic T cells retrieved from mice administered MHC 
      II(-/-) HD-DCs suppressed dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis in 
      recipient mice. Our studies reveal that HD-DCs can suppress colitis via an 
      alternative MHC II-independent pathway that involves, in part, mobilization of 
      T-cell responses. These data support the utility of HD-DCs in blocking colitis, 
      revealing a requirement for Ccr7 and providing for HD-DC autologous immunotherapy 
      for disease in which MHC II expression and/or function is compromised.

TI  - Identification and characterization of the BRI2 interactome in the brain.
PG  - 3548
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-21453-3 [doi]
LID - 3548
AB  - BRI family proteins are ubiquitous type II transmembrane proteins but BRI2 is 
      highly expressed in some neuronal tissues. Possible BRI2 functions include 
      neuronal maturation and differentiation. Protein complexes appear to be important 
      in mediating its functions. Previously described BRI2 interactors include the 
      Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein and protein phosphatase 1, but clearly the 
      identification of novel interactors provides an important tool to understand the 
      role and function of BRI2. To this end three rat brain regions (cerebellum, 
      hippocampus, and cerebral cortex) were processed by BRI2 immunoprecipitation; 
      co-precipitating proteins were identified by Nano-HPLC-MS/MS. The pool of the 
      brain regions resulted in 511 BRI2 interacting proteins (BRI2 brain interactome) 
      of which 120 were brain specific and 49 involved in neuronal differentiation. 
      Brain region-specific analyses were also carried out for cerebellum, hippocampus, 
      and cerebral cortex. Several novel BRI2 interactors were identified among them 
      DLG4/PSD-95, which is singularly important as it places BRI2 in the postsynaptic 
      compartment. This interaction was validated as well as the interaction with 
      GAP-43 and synaptophysin. In essence, the resulting BRI2 brain interactome, 
      associates this protein with neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation, as 
      well as synaptic signalling and plasticity. It follows that further studies 
      should address BRI2 particularly given its relevance to neuropathological 
      conditions.

LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-7398-9_31 [doi]
AB  - High-throughput phenotyping has opened whole new perspectives for crop 
      improvement and better understanding of quantitative traits in plants. Generation 
      of loss-of-function and gain-of-function plant mutants requires processing and 
      imaging a large number of plants in order to determine unknown gene functions and 
      phenotypic changes generated by genetic modifications or selection of new traits. 
      The use of phenomics for the evaluation of transgenic lines contributed 
      significantly to the identification of plants more tolerant to biotic/abiotic 
      stresses and furthermore, helped in the identification of unknown gene functions. 
      In this chapter we describe the High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platform 
      working in our facility, drawing the general protocol and showing some examples 
      of data obtainable from the platform. Tomato transgenic plants over-expressing 
      the arginine decarboxylase 2 gene, which is involved in the polyamine 
      biosynthetic pathway, were analyzed through our HTP facility for their tolerance 
      to abiotic stress and significant differences in water content and ability to 
      recover after drought stress where highlighted. This demonstrates the 
      applicability of this methodology to the plant polyamine field.

TI  - Arabidopsis phenotyping through geometric morphometrics.
LID - 10.1093/gigascience/giy073 [doi]
LID - giy073
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, great technical progress has been achieved in the field of 
      plant phenotyping. High-throughput platforms and the development of improved 
      algorithms for rosette image segmentation make it possible to extract shape and 
      size parameters for genetic, physiological, and environmental studies on a large 
      scale. The development of low-cost phenotyping platforms and freeware resources 
      make it possible to widely expand phenotypic analysis tools for Arabidopsis. 
      However, objective descriptors of shape parameters that could be used 
      independently of the platform and segmentation software used are still lacking, 
      and shape descriptions still rely on ad hoc or even contradictory descriptors, 
      which could make comparisons difficult and perhaps inaccurate. Modern geometric 
      morphometrics is a family of methods in quantitative biology proposed to be the 
      main source of data and analytical tools in the emerging field of phenomics 
      studies. Based on the location of landmarks (corresponding points) over imaged 
      specimens and by combining geometry, multivariate analysis, and powerful 
      statistical techniques, these tools offer the possibility to reproducibly and 
      accurately account for shape variations among groups and measure them in shape 
      distance units. RESULTS: Here, a particular scheme of landmark placement on 
      Arabidopsis rosette images is proposed to study shape variation in viral 
      infection processes. Shape differences between controls and infected plants are 
      quantified throughout the infectious process and visualized. Quantitative 
      comparisons between two unrelated ssRNA+ viruses are shown, and reproducibility 
      issues are assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Combined with the newest automated platforms 
      and plant segmentation procedures, geometric morphometric tools could boost 
      phenotypic features extraction and processing in an objective, reproducible 
      manner.

AB  - OBJECTIVE:  To summarize notable research contributions published in 2017 on data 
      sharing and privacy issues in medical informatics. METHODS:  An extensive search 
      of PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and AAAI 
      Digital Library was conducted to uncover the scientific contributions published 
      in 2017 that addressed issues of biomedical data sharing, with a focus on data 
      access and privacy. The selection process was based on three steps: (i) a 
      selection of candidate best papers, (ii) the review of the candidate best papers 
      by a team of international experts with respect to six predefined criteria, and 
      (iii) the selection of the best papers by the editorial board of the Yearbook 
      Results: Five best papers were selected. They cover the lifecycle of biomedical 
      data collection, use, and sharing. The papers introduce 1) consenting strategies 
      for emerging environments, 2) software for searching and retrieving datasets in 
      organizationally distributed environments, 3) approaches to measure the privacy 
      risks of sharing new data increasingly utilized in research and the clinical 
      setting (e.g., genomic), 4) new cryptographic techniques for querying clinical 
      data for cohort discovery, and 5) novel game theoretic strategies for publishing 
      summary information about genome-phenome studies that balance the utility of the 
      data with potential privacy risks to the participants of such studies. 
      CONCLUSION:  The papers illustrated that there is no one-size-fitsall solution to 
      privacy while working with biomedical data. At the same time, the papers show 
      that there are opportunities for leveraging newly emerging technologies to enable 
      data use while minimizing privacy risks.

AB  - HIPBI-RD (Harmonising phenomics information for a better interoperability in the 
      rare disease field) is a three-year project which started in 2016 funded via the 
      E-Rare 3 ERA-NET program. This project builds on three resources largely adopted 
      by the rare disease (RD) community: Orphanet, its ontology ORDO (the Orphanet 
      Rare Disease Ontology), HPO (the Human Phenotype Ontology) as well as PhenoTips 
      software for the capture and sharing of structured phenotypic data for RD 
      patients. Our project is further supported by resources developed by the European 
      Bioinformatics Institute and the Garvan Institute. HIPBI-RD aims to provide the 
      community with an integrated, RD-specific bioinformatics ecosystem that will 
      harmonise the way phenomics information is stored in databases and patient files 
      worldwide, and thereby contribute to interoperability. This ecosystem will 
      consist of a suite of tools and ontologies, optimized to work together, and made 
      available through commonly used software repositories. The project workplan 
      follows three main objectives: The HIPBI-RD ecosystem will contribute to the 
      interpretation of variants identified through exome and full genome sequencing by 
      harmonising the way phenotypic information is collected, thus improving 
      diagnostics and delineation of RD. The ultimate goal of HIPBI-RD is to provide a 
      resource that will contribute to bridging genome-scale biology and a 
      disease-centered view on human pathobiology. Achievements in Year 1.

TI  - The ICR639 CPG NGS validation series: A resource to assess analytical sensitivity 
      of cancer predisposition gene testing.
PG  - 68
LID - 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.14594.1 [doi]
LID - 68
AB  - The analytical sensitivity of a next generation sequencing (NGS) test reflects 
      the ability of the test to detect real sequence variation. The evaluation of 
      analytical sensitivity relies on the availability of gold-standard, validated, 
      benchmarking datasets. For NGS analysis the availability of suitable datasets has 
      been limited. Most laboratories undertake small scale evaluations using in-house 
      data, and/or rely on in silico generated datasets to evaluate the performance of 
      NGS variant detection pipelines. Cancer predisposition genes (CPGs), such as 
      BRCA1 and BRCA2, are amongst the most widely tested genes in clinical practice 
      today. Hundreds of providers across the world are now offering CPG testing using 
      NGS methods. Validating and comparing the analytical sensitivity of CPG tests has 
      proved difficult, due to the absence of comprehensive, orthogonally validated, 
      benchmarking datasets of CPG pathogenic variants. To address this we present the 
      ICR639 CPG NGS validation series. This dataset comprises data from 639 
      individuals. Each individual has sequencing data generated using the TruSight 
      Cancer Panel (TSCP), a targeted NGS assay for the analysis of CPGs, together with 
      orthogonally generated data showing the presence of at least one CPG pathogenic 
      variant per individual. The set consists of 645 pathogenic variants in total. 
      There is strong representation of the most challenging types of variants to 
      detect, with 339 indels, including 16 complex indels and 24 with length greater 
      than five base pairs and 74 exon copy number variations (CNVs) including 23 
      single exon CNVs. The series includes pathogenic variants in 31 CPGs, including 
      502 pathogenic variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2, making this an important comprehensive 
      validation dataset for providers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 NGS testing. We have 
      deposited the TSCP FASTQ files of the ICR639 series in the European 
      Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) under accession number EGAD00001004134.

AB  - Diverticular disease is common and has a high morbidity. Treatments are limited 
      owing to the poor understanding of its pathophysiology. Here, to elucidate its 
      etiology, we performed a genome-wide association study of diverticular disease 
      (27,444 cases; 382,284 controls) from the UK Biobank and tested for replication 
      in the Michigan Genomics Initiative (2,572 cases; 28,649 controls). We identified 
      42 loci associated with diverticular disease; 39 of these loci are novel. Using 
      data-driven expression-prioritized integration for complex traits (DEPICT), we 
      show that genes in these associated regions are significantly enriched for 
      expression in mesenchymal stem cells and multiple connective tissue cell types 
      and are co-expressed with genes that have a role in vascular and mesenchymal 
      biology. Genes in these associated loci have roles in immunity, extracellular 
      matrix biology, cell adhesion, membrane transport and intestinal motility. 
      Phenome-wide association analysis of the 42 variants shows a common etiology of 
      diverticular disease with obesity and hernia. These analyses shed light on the 
      genomic landscape of diverticular disease.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe our experience with a large cohort (411 patients from 288 
      families) of various forms of skeletal dysplasia who were molecularly 
      characterized. METHODS: Detailed phenotyping and next-generation sequencing 
      (panel and exome). RESULTS: Our analysis revealed 224 pathogenic/likely 
      pathogenic variants (54 (24%) of which are novel) in 123 genes with established 
      or tentative links to skeletal dysplasia. In addition, we propose 5 genes as 
      candidate disease genes with suggestive biological links (WNT3A, SUCO, RIN1, 
      DIP2C, and PAN2). Phenotypically, we note that our cohort spans 36 established 
      phenotypic categories by the International Skeletal Dysplasia Nosology, as well 
      as 18 novel skeletal dysplasia phenotypes that could not be classified under 
      these categories, e.g., the novel C3orf17-related skeletal dysplasia. We also 
      describe novel phenotypic aspects of well-known disease genes, e.g., 
      PGAP3-related Toriello-Carey syndrome-like phenotype. We note a strong founder 
      effect for many genes in our cohort, which allowed us to calculate a minimum 
      disease burden for the autosomal recessive forms of skeletal dysplasia in our 
      population (7.16E-04), which is much higher than the global average. CONCLUSION: 
      By expanding the phenotypic, allelic, and locus heterogeneity of skeletal 
      dysplasia in humans, we hope our study will improve the diagnostic rate of 
      patients with these conditions.

      premature coronary artery disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum uric acid (SUA) is a heritable trait associated with 
      cardiovascular risk factors and coronary artery disease (CAD). Genome wide 
      association studies (GWAS) have identified several genes associated with SUA, 
      mainly in European populations. However, to date there are few GWAS in Latino 
      populations, and the role of SUA-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs) in cardiovascular disease has not been studied in the Mexican population. 
      METHODS: We performed genome-wide SUA association study in 2153 Mexican children 
      and adults, evaluated whether genetic effects were modified by sex and obesity, 
      and used a Mendelian randomization approach in an independent cohort to study the 
      role of SUA modifying genetic variants in premature CAD. RESULTS: Only two loci 
      were associated with SUA levels: SLC2A9 (β = -0.47 mg/dl, P = 1.57 × 10(-42) for 
      lead SNP rs7678287) and ABCG2 (β = 0.23 mg/dl, P = 2.42 × 10(-10) for lead SNP 
      rs2231142). No significant interaction between SLC2A9 rs7678287 and ABCG2 
      rs2231142 genotypes and obesity was observed. However, a significant ABCG2 
      rs2231142 genotype*sex interaction (P = 0.001) was observed in adults but not in 
      children. Although SUA levels were associated with premature CAD, metabolic 
      syndrome and decreased glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), only ABCG2 rs2231142 
      was associated with decreased eGFR in the premature CAD group. CONCLUSIONS: SUA 
      elevation was independently associated with premature CAD, metabolic syndrome and 
      decreased eGFR in the Mexican population. However, a Mendelian randomization 
      approach using the lead SUA-associated SNPs (SLC2A9 and ABCG2) did not support a 
      causal role of elevated SUA levels for premature CAD.

TI  - Modelling non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in human hepatocyte-like cells.
LID - 10.1098/rstb.2017.0362 [doi]
LID - 20170362
AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver 
      disease in developed countries. An in vitro NAFLD model would permit mechanistic 
      studies and enable high-throughput therapeutic screening. While hepatic 
      cancer-derived cell lines are a convenient, renewable resource, their genomic, 
      epigenomic and functional alterations mean their utility in NAFLD modelling is 
      unclear. Additionally, the epigenetic mark 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a cell 
      lineage identifier, is rapidly lost during cell culture, alongside expression of 
      the Ten-eleven-translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase enzymes, 
      restricting meaningful epigenetic analysis. Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) derived 
      from human embryonic stem cells can provide a non-neoplastic, renewable model for 
      liver research. Here, we have developed a model of NAFLD using HLCs exposed to 
      lactate, pyruvate and octanoic acid (LPO) that bear all the hallmarks, including 
      5hmC profiles, of liver functionality. We exposed HLCs to LPO for 48 h to induce 
      lipid accumulation. We characterized the transcriptome using RNA-seq, the 
      metabolome using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and 
      the epigenome using 5-hydroxymethylation DNA immunoprecipitation (hmeDIP) 
      sequencing. LPO exposure induced an NAFLD phenotype in HLCs with transcriptional 
      and metabolomic dysregulation consistent with those present in human NAFLD. HLCs 
      maintain expression of the TET enzymes and have a liver-like epigenome. LPO 
      exposure-induced 5hmC enrichment at lipid synthesis and transport genes. HLCs 
      treated with LPO recapitulate the transcriptional and metabolic dysregulation 
      seen in NAFLD and additionally retain TET expression and 5hmC. This in vitro 
      model of NAFLD will be useful for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies.This 
      article is part of the theme issue 'Designer human tissue: coming to a lab near 
      you'.

TI  - Clinical lipidomics: a new way to diagnose human diseases.
PG  - 12
LID - 10.1186/s40169-018-0190-9 [doi]
LID - 12
AB  - Lipidomics is a measurement of a large scale of lipid species to understand roles 
      of their carbon atoms, dual bonds, or isomerism in the lipid molecule. Clinical 
      lipidomics was recently defined "as a new integrative biomedicine to discover the 
      correlation and regulation between a large scale of lipid elements measured and 
      analyzed in liquid biopsies from patients with those patient phenomes and 
      clinical phenotypes". The first step to translate lipidomics into clinical 
      lipidomics is to settle a number of standard operation procedures and protocols 
      of lipidomics performance and measurement. Clinical lipidomics is the part of 
      clinical trans-omics which was coined as a new emerging scientific discipline 
      where clinical phenomes are integrated with molecular multiomics. We believe it 
      is the time to translate lipid science and lipidomics into clinical application 
      and to understand the importance of clinical lipidomics as one of the most 
      helpful approaches during the design and decision-making of therapeutic 
      strategies for individuals. We emphasize here that clinical lipidomics should be 
      merged with clinical phenomes, e.g. patient signs and symptoms, biomedical 
      analyses, pathology, images, and responses to therapies, although it is difficult 
      to integrate and fuse the information of clinical lipidomics with clinical 
      phenomes. It will be a great achievement if we can draw the networks of lipidomic 
      species fused with networks of genes and proteins to describe the molecular 
      mechanisms of the disease in multi-dimensions.

TI  - Drug Repurposing for Japanese Encephalitis Virus Infection by Systems Biology 
      Methods.
LID - 10.3390/molecules23123346 [doi]
LID - 3346
AB  - Japanese encephalitis is a zoonotic disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis 
      virus (JEV). It is mainly epidemic in Asia with an estimated 69,000 cases 
      occurring per year. However, no approved agents are available for the treatment 
      of JEV infection, and existing vaccines cannot control various types of JEV 
      strains. Drug repurposing is a new concept for finding new indication of existing 
      drugs, and, recently, the concept has been used to discover new antiviral agents. 
      Identifying host proteins involved in the progress of JEV infection and using 
      these proteins as targets are the center of drug repurposing for JEV infection. 
      In this study, based on the gene expression data of JEV infection and the 
      phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) data, we identified 286 genes that 
      participate in the progress of JEV infection using systems biology methods. The 
      enrichment analysis of these genes suggested that the genes identified by our 
      methods were predominantly related to viral infection pathways and immune 
      response-related pathways. We found that bortezomib, which can target these 
      genes, may have an effect on the treatment of JEV infection. Subsequently, we 
      evaluated the antiviral activity of bortezomib using a JEV-infected mouse model. 
      The results showed that bortezomib can lower JEV-induced lethality in mice, 
      alleviate suffering in JEV-infected mice and reduce the damage in brains caused 
      by JEV infection. This work provides an agent with new indication to treat JEV 
      infection.

TI  - Chrysophanol protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by suppressing 
      cellular PARylation.
PG  - 782-793
LID - 10.1016/j.apsb.2018.10.008 [doi]
AB  - The clinical application of doxorubicin (DOX) in cancer chemotherapy is limited 
      by its life-threatening cardiotoxic effects. Chrysophanol (CHR), an anthraquinone 
      compound isolated from the rhizome of Rheum palmatum L., is considered to play a 
      broad role in a variety of biological processes. However, the effects of CHR׳s 
      cardioprotection in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy is poorly understood. In this 
      study, we found that the cardiac apoptosis, mitochondrial injury and cellular 
      PARylation levels were significantly increased in H9C2 cells treated by Dox, 
      while these effects were suppressed by CHR. Similar results were observed when 
      PARP1 activity was suppressed by its inhibitors 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) and 
      ABT888. Ectopic expression of PARP1 effectively blocked this CHR׳s 
      cardioprotection against DOX-induced cardiomyocyte injury in H9C2 cells. 
      Furthermore, pre-administration with both CHR and 3AB relieved DOX-induced 
      cardiac apoptosis, mitochondrial impairment and heart dysfunction in 
      Sprague-Dawley rat model. These results revealed that CHR protects against 
      DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by suppressing cellular PARylation and provided 
      critical evidence that PARylation may be a novel target for DOX-induced 
      cardiomyopathy.

TI  - On the utilization of novel spectral laser scanning for three-dimensional 
      classification of vegetation elements.

AB  - The Dual-Wavelength Echidna Lidar (DWEL), a full waveform terrestrial laser 
      scanner (TLS), has been used to scan a variety of forested and agricultural 
      environments. From these scanning campaigns, we summarize the benefits and 
      challenges given by DWEL's novel coaxial dual-wavelength scanning technology, 
      particularly for the three-dimensional (3D) classification of vegetation 
      elements. Simultaneous scanning at both 1064 nm and 1548 nm by DWEL instruments 
      provides a new spectral dimension to TLS data that joins the 3D spatial dimension 
      of lidar as an information source. Our point cloud classification algorithm 
      explores the utilization of both spectral and spatial attributes of individual 
      points from DWEL scans and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each 
      attribute domain. The spectral and spatial attributes for vegetation element 
      classification each perform better in different parts of vegetation (canopy 
      interior, fine branches, coarse trunks, etc.) and under different vegetation 
      conditions (dead or live, leaf-on or leaf-off, water content, etc.). These 
      environmental characteristics of vegetation, convolved with the lidar instrument 
      specifications and lidar data quality, result in the actual capabilities of 
      spectral and spatial attributes to classify vegetation elements in 3D space. The 
      spectral and spatial information domains thus complement each other in the 
      classification process. The joint use of both not only enhances the 
      classification accuracy but also reduces its variance across the multiple 
      vegetation types we have examined, highlighting the value of the DWEL as a new 
      source of 3D spectral information. Wider deployment of the DWEL instruments is in 
      practice currently held back by challenges in instrument development and the 
      demands of data processing required by coaxial dual- or multi-wavelength 
      scanning. But the simultaneous 3D acquisition of both spectral and spatial 
      features, offered by new multispectral scanning instruments such as the DWEL, 
      opens doors to study biophysical and biochemical properties of forested and 
      agricultural ecosystems at more detailed scales.

TI  - knnAUC: an open-source R package for detecting nonlinear dependence between one 
      continuous variable and one binary variable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Testing the dependence of two variables is one of the fundamental 
      tasks in statistics. In this work, we developed an open-source R package (knnAUC) 
      for detecting nonlinear dependence between one continuous variable X and one 
      binary dependent variables Y (0 or 1). RESULTS: We addressed this problem by 
      using knnAUC (k-nearest neighbors AUC test, the R package is available at 
      https://sourceforge.net/projects/knnauc/ ). In the knnAUC software framework, we 
      first resampled a dataset to get the training and testing dataset according to 
      the sample ratio (from 0 to 1), and then constructed a k-nearest neighbors 
      algorithm classifier to get the yhat estimator (the probability of y = 1) of 
      testy (the true label of testing dataset). Finally, we calculated the AUC (area 
      under the curve of receiver operating characteristic) estimator and tested 
      whether the AUC estimator is greater than 0.5. To evaluate the advantages of 
      knnAUC compared to seven other popular methods, we performed extensive 
      simulations to explore the relationships between eight different methods and 
      compared the false positive rates and statistical power using both simulated and 
      real datasets (Chronic hepatitis B datasets and kidney cancer RNA-seq datasets). 
      CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that knnAUC is an efficient R package to test 
      non-linear dependence between one continuous variable and one binary dependent 
      variable especially in computational biology area.

TI  - MR-PheWAS: exploring the causal effect of SUA level on multiple disease outcomes 
      by using genetic instruments in UK Biobank.
PG  - 1039-1047
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2017-212534 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the role of serum uric acid (SUA) level in a 
      broad spectrum of disease outcomes using data for 120 091 individuals from UK 
      Biobank. METHODS: We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to 
      identify disease outcomes associated with SUA genetic risk loci. We then 
      implemented conventional Mendelianrandomisation (MR) analysis to investigate the 
      causal relevance between SUA level and disease outcomes identified from PheWAS. 
      We next applied MR Egger analysis to detect and account for potential pleiotropy, 
      which conventional MR analysis might mistake for causality, and used the HEIDI 
      (heterogeneity in dependent instruments) test to remove cross-phenotype 
      associations that were likely due to genetic linkage. RESULTS: Our PheWAS 
      identified 25 disease groups/outcomes associated with SUA genetic risk loci after 
      multiple testing correction (P<8.57e-05). Our conventional MR analysis implicated 
      a causal role of SUA level in three disease groups: inflammatory 
      polyarthropathies (OR=1.22, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.34), hypertensive disease (OR=1.08, 
      95% CI 1.03 to 1.14) and disorders of metabolism (OR=1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14); 
      and four disease outcomes: gout (OR=4.88, 95% CI 3.91 to 6.09), essential 
      hypertension (OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.14), myocardial infarction (OR=1.16, 95% 
      CI 1.03 to 1.30) and coeliac disease (OR=1.41, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.89). After 
      balancing pleiotropic effects in MR Egger analysis, only gout and its 
      encompassing disease group of inflammatory polyarthropathies were considered to 
      be causally associated with SUA level. Our analysis highlighted a locus 
      (ATXN2/S2HB3) that may influence SUA level and multiple cardiovascular and 
      autoimmune diseases via pleiotropy. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated SUA level is convincing 
      to cause gout and inflammatory polyarthropathies, and might act as a marker for 
      the wider range of diseases with which it associates. Our findings support 
      further investigation on the clinical relevance of SUA level with cardiovascular, 
      metabolic, autoimmune and respiratory diseases.

AB  - The mammalian stomach is structurally highly diverse and its organ functionality 
      critically depends on a normal embryonic development. Although there have been 
      several studies on the morphological changes during stomach development, a 
      system-wide analysis of the underlying molecular changes is lacking. Here, we 
      present a comprehensive, temporal proteome and transcriptome atlas of the mouse 
      stomach at multiple developmental stages. Quantitative analysis of 12,108 gene 
      products allows identifying three distinct phases based on changes in proteins 
      and RNAs and the gain of stomach functions on a longitudinal time scale. The 
      transcriptome indicates functionally important isoforms relevant to development 
      and identifies several functionally unannotated novel splicing junction 
      transcripts that we validate at the peptide level. Importantly, many proteins 
      differentially expressed in stomach development are also significantly 
      overexpressed in diffuse-type gastric cancer. Overall, our study provides a 
      resource to understand stomach development and its connection to gastric cancer 
      tumorigenesis.

TI  - Gain-of-function HCN2 variants in genetic epilepsy.
PG  - 202-209
LID - 10.1002/humu.23357 [doi]
AB  - Genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) is a common epilepsy syndrome that encompasses 
      seizure disorders characterized by spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs). Pacemaker 
      hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN) are considered 
      integral to SWD genesis, making them an ideal gene candidate for GGE. We 
      identified HCN2 missense variants from a large cohort of 585 GGE patients, 
      recruited by the Epilepsy Phenome-Genome Project (EPGP), and performed functional 
      analysis using two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus oocytes. The 
      p.S632W variant was identified in a patient with idiopathic photosensitive 
      occipital epilepsy and segregated in the family. This variant was also 
      independently identified in an unrelated patient with childhood absence seizures 
      from a European cohort of 238 familial GGE cases. The p.V246M variant was 
      identified in a patient with photo-sensitive GGE and his father diagnosed with 
      juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Functional studies revealed that both p.S632W and 
      p.V246M had an identical functional impact including a depolarizing shift in the 
      voltage dependence of activation that is consistent with a gain-of-function. In 
      contrast, no biophysical changes resulted from the introduction of common 
      population variants, p.E280K and p.A705T, and the p.R756C variant from EPGP that 
      did not segregate with disease. Our data suggest that HCN2 variants can confer 
      susceptibility to GGE via a gain-of-function mechanism.

AB  - Identifying genetic and environmental factors that impact complex traits and 
      common diseases is a high biomedical priority. Here, we developed, validated, and 
      implemented a series of multi-layered systems approaches, including 
      (expression-based) phenome-wide association, transcriptome-/proteome-wide 
      association, and (reverse-) mediation analysis, in an open-access web server 
      (systems-genetics.org) to expedite the systems dissection of gene function. We 
      applied these approaches to multi-omics datasets from the BXD mouse genetic 
      reference population, and identified and validated associations between genes and 
      clinical and molecular phenotypes, including previously unreported links between 
      Rpl26 and body weight, and Cpt1a and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, through 
      mediation and reverse-mediation analysis we established regulatory relations 
      between genes, such as the co-regulation of BCKDHA and BCKDHB protein levels, and 
      identified targets of transcription factors E2F6, ZFP277, and ZKSCAN1. Our 
      multifaceted toolkit enabled the identification of gene-gene and gene-phenotype 
      links that are robust and that translate well across populations and species, and 
      can be universally applied to any populations with multi-omics datasets.

TI  - Duhuo Jisheng Decoction inhibits SDF-1-induced inflammation and matrix 
      degradation in human degenerative nucleus pulposus cells in vitro through the 
      CXCR4/NF-κB pathway.
PG  - 912-922
LID - 10.1038/aps.2018.36 [doi]
AB  - Lower back pain (LBP) is the most common disease in orthopedic clinics 
      world-wide. A classic Fangji of traditional Chinese medicine, Duhuo Jisheng 
      Decoction (DHJSD), has been proven clinically effective for LBP but its 
      therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that DHJSD might relieve 
      LBP through inhibiting the exaggerated proinflammatory cytokines and 
      extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Thus, we studied the effects of DHJSD on 
      stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)-induced inflammation and ECM degradation in 
      human nucleus pulposus cells (hNPCs). The primary hNPCs were isolated from either 
      degenerated human intervertebral disc (HID) of LBP patients or normal HID of 
      lumbar vertebral fracture patients, and cultured in vitro. The cells were treated 
      with SDF-1 (10 ng/mL) and subsequently with different concentrations (100-500 
      μg/mL) of DHJSD for 24 h, respectively. We found that application of DHJSD 
      significantly antagonized the SDF-1-induced production of proinflammatory 
      cytokines and reduction of aggrecan and type II collagen in the hNPCs. DHJSD also 
      markedly reduced the SDF-1-induced increase of CXCR4 and p-p65 and inhibited the 
      nuclear translocation of p65 in the hNPCs. DHJSD, CXCR4-siRNA, and NF-κB 
      inhibitor (BAY11-7082) caused the same inhibition of exaggerated proinflammatory 
      cytokines in the SDF-1-treated hNPCs. These results provided compelling evidence 
      that DHJSD may inhibit the generation of proinflammatory mediators and ECM 
      degradation of HID through an orchestrated targeting at multiple molecules in the 
      SDF-1/CXCR4/NF-κB pathway, thus offered novel mechanistic insights into the 
      clinical effectiveness of DHJSD on LBP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: China has made substantial progress in tackling its HIV and AIDS 
      epidemic. But the changing patterns of HIV and AIDS incidence based on the 
      longitudinal observation data were rarely studied. METHODS: The reporting 
      incidence (RI) and mortality data on HIV and AIDS in China covering 31 provinces 
      from 2004 to 2014 were collected from the Chinese Public Health Science Data 
      Center. To decompose the time-series data, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) was 
      applied to properly describe the trends of HIV and AIDS incidence. A mathematical 
      model was used to estimate the relative change of incidence among provinces and 
      age groups. RESULTS: A total of 483,010 newly HIV infections and 214,205 AIDS 
      cases were reported between 2004 and 2014 nationwide. HIV infection increased 
      from 13,258 in 2004 (RI 1.02 per 100,000 person years) to 74,048 in 2014 (RI 5.46 
      per 100,000). The number of AIDS cases increased from 3054 in 2004 (RI 0.23 per 
      100,000) to 45,145 in 2014 (RI 3.33 per 100,000). The overall relative changes 
      for HIV infection and AIDS incidence were 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
      1.10-1.13) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.23-1.33), respectively. The relative increase for 
      HIV and AIDS RI was higher in northwest provinces while lower in Henan, Xinjiang, 
      Guangxi and Yunnan. The overall relative changes for HIV infection were 1.12 (95% 
      CI 1.11-1.14) in males and 1.10 (95% CI 1.06-1.13) in females. For AIDS RI, the 
      relative increases were 1.31 (95% CI 1.26-1.36) in males and 1.22 (95% CI 
      1.17-1.28) in females. The lowest relative increase was detected among young 
      adults, while the largest relative increase (odds ratio [OR] > 1.30) was detected 
      in people aged 55 years or above. CONCLUSIONS: HIV and AIDS showed an increasing 
      trend in China from 2004 to 2014, respectively, but the epidemic tended to be 
      under control among provinces and young people that used to have a high HIV and 
      AIDS incidence. Northwest China and older people could be new "hop-spots" for HIV 
      and AIDS risk.

TI  - The trends in incidence of primary liver cancer caused by specific etiologies: 
      Results from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 and implications for liver 
      cancer prevention.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Liver cancer is a common malignant neoplasm worldwide. The 
      etiologies for liver cancer are diverse and the incidence trends of liver cancer 
      caused by specific etiologies are rarely studied. We therefore aimed to determine 
      the pattern of liver cancer incidence, as well as temporal trends. METHODS: We 
      collected detailed information on liver cancer etiology between 1990-2016, 
      derived from the Global Burden of Disease study in 2016. Estimated annual 
      percentage changes (EAPCs) in liver cancer age standardized incidence rate (ASR), 
      by sex, region, and etiology, were calculated to quantify the temporal trends in 
      liver cancer ASR. RESULTS: Globally, incident cases of liver cancer increased 
      114.0% from 471,000 in 1990 to 1,007,800 in 2016. The overall ASR increased by an 
      average 0.34% (95% CI 0.22%-0.45%) per year in this period. The ASR of liver 
      cancer due to hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and other causes increased between 1990 
      and 2016. The corresponding EAPCs were 0.22 (95% CI 0.08-0.36), 0.57 (95% CI 
      0.48-0.66), and 0.51 (95% CI 0.41-0.62), respectively. The ASR of liver cancer 
      due to reported alcohol use remained stable (EAPC = 0.10, 95% CI -0.06-0.25). 
      This increasing pattern was heterogeneous across regions and countries. The most 
      pronounced increases were generally observed in countries with a high 
      socio-demographic index, including the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Liver cancer remains a major public health concern globally, though 
      control of hepatitis B and C virus infections has contributed to the decreasing 
      incidence in some regions. We observed an unfavorable trend in countries with a 
      high socio-demographic index, suggesting that current prevention strategies 
      should be reoriented, and much more targeted and specific strategies should be 
      established in some countries to forestall the increase in liver cancer. LAY 
      SUMMARY: Liver cancer is a common malignant neoplasm worldwide. The incidence 
      patterns of liver cancer caused by different etiologies varied considerably 
      across the world. In this study, we aim to determine the pattern of liver cancer 
      incidence as well as the temporal trends, thereby facilitating the establishment 
      of more tailored prevention strategies for liver cancer.

PG  - 760-769
AB  - As the quantity and detail of association studies between clinical phenotypes and 
      genotypes grows, there is a push to make summary statistics widely available. 
      Genome wide summary statistics have been shown to be vulnerable to the inference 
      of a targeted individual's presence. In this paper, we show that presence attacks 
      are feasible with phenome wide summary statistics as well. We use data from three 
      healthcare organizations and an online resource that publishes summary 
      statistics. We introduce a novel attack that achieves over 80% recall and 
      precision within a population of 16,346, where 8,173 individuals are targets. 
      However, the feasibility of the attack is dependent on the attacker's knowledge 
      about 1) the targeted individual and 2) the reference dataset. Within a 
      population of over 2 million, where 8,173 individuals are targets, our attack 
      achieves 31% recall and 17% precision. As a result, it is plausible that sharing 
      of phenomic summary statistics may be accomplished with an acceptable level of 
      privacy risk.

TI  - A reference peptide database for proteome quantification based on experimental 
      mass spectrum response curves.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Mass spectrometry (MS) based quantification of proteins/peptides has 
      become a powerful tool in biological research with high sensitivity and 
      throughput. The accuracy of quantification, however, has been problematic as not 
      all peptides are suitable for quantification. Several methods and tools have been 
      developed to identify peptides that response well in mass spectrometry and they 
      are mainly based on predictive models, and rarely consider the linearity of the 
      response curve, limiting the accuracy and applicability of the methods. An 
      alternative solution is to select empirically superior peptides that offer 
      satisfactory MS response intensity and linearity in a wide dynamic range of 
      peptide concentration. RESULTS: We constructed a reference database for proteome 
      quantification based on experimental mass spectrum response curves. The intensity 
      and dynamic range of over 2 647 773 transitions from 121 318 peptides were 
      obtained from a set of dilution experiments, covering 11 040 gene products. These 
      transitions and peptides were evaluated and presented in a database named 
      SCRIPT-MAP. We showed that the best-responder (BR) peptide approach for 
      quantification based on SCRIPT-MAP database is robust, repeatable and accurate in 
      proteome-scale protein quantification. This study provides a reference database 
      as well as a peptides/transitions selection method for quantitative proteomics. 
      AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SCRIPT-MAP database is available at 
      http://www.firmiana.org/responders/. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary 
      data are available at Bioinformatics online.

AB  - Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disease characterized mainly by 
      fibrosis of skin and internal organs. Our previous study has shown that 
      salvianolic acid B (SAB), a bioactive component extracted from Salvia 
      miltiorrhiza (SM), was one of the essential ingredients in the traditional 
      Chinese medicine Yiqihuoxue formula, which has been used to treat SSc-related 
      dermal and pulmonary fibrosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 
      effect of SAB on skin fibrosis and explore its underlying anti-fibrotic 
      mechanism. We found that SAB was capable of alleviating skin fibrosis in a 
      bleomycin-induced SSc mouse model, alleviating skin thickness and reducing 
      collagen deposition. in vitro studies indicated that SAB reduced SSc skin 
      fibroblast proliferation and downregulated extracellular matrix gene 
      transcription and collagen protein expression. TGF-β/SMAD and MAPK/ERK pathway 
      activation were also shown to be suppressed in SAB treated fibroblasts. Moreover, 
      RNA-seq revealed that the anti-fibrotic effect of SAB might be related to 
      antioxidant activity, the cell cycle, and the p53 signaling pathway. Taken 
      together, our results suggest that SAB has the ability to alleviate SSc-related 
      skin fibrosis both in vivo and in vitro.

AB  - Endothelial cell injury and subsequent inflammation play pivotal roles in the 
      pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive and fatal disorder. We found 
      previously that salvianolic acid B (SAB) attenuated experimental pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is driven by inflammation, but the anti-inflammatory 
      role and mechanism of SAB on the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis is still 
      unknown. Here, our in vivo studies showed that SAB had a strong anti-inflammatory 
      effect on bleomycin-instilled mice by inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration 
      and inflammatory cytokine production. Moreover, SAB protected endothelial cells 
      against oxidative stress injury and inhibited endothelial cell apoptosis in 
      bleomycin-treated mice. The in vitro studies also showed that SAB decreased the 
      H(2)O(2)-induced overproduction of reactive oxygen species to protect EA.hy926 
      endothelial cells from oxidative damage, and further inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced 
      permeability and overexpression of pro-inflammatory molecules. The next studies 
      revealed that SAB inhibited the H(2)O(2)-induced cell apoptosis and attenuated 
      the decrease of tight junction-related gene expression, resulting in a decrease 
      of the endothelial permeability in injured endothelial cells. Furthermore, 
      Western blot analysis suggested that SAB decreased endothelial cell permeability 
      and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting MAPK and NF-κB 
      signaling pathways. Taken together, these data indicate that SAB exerted 
      anti-inflammatory roles in pulmonary fibrosis by protection of the endothelial 
      cells against oxidative stress injury, mediated by inhibition of endothelial 
      permeability and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine via the MAPK and NF-κB 
      signaling pathways.

AB  - Schizonepeta tenuifolia (ST) Briq. is a traditional herbal medicine commonly used 
      to treat allergic skin diseases, where the inflammation process is closely 
      related to symptom severity. This study aimed to explore the immunomodulatory 
      effect of ST by using immunoglobulin E- (IgE-) stimulated RBL-2H3 cell cultures, 
      a common cell line for studying mast cell degranulation and inflammatory cytokine 
      release in vitro. After stimulating the RBL-2H3 cells with IgE, ST at 
      concentrations of 10, 50, or 100 μg/mL was added to the cell cultures. Cell 
      viability, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-13, IL-4, TNF-α, and IFN-γ), 
      anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and degranulation ability were examined 48 and 
      72 hours after administration of ST. The markers of inflammation and allergic 
      reaction, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-6, were suppressed, especially after 
      treatment with 100 μg/mL ST. However, the anti-inflammation marker IL-10 was also 
      suppressed by ST. Trend analysis showed that a higher ST concentration was 
      associated with lower IFN-γ and TNF-α levels. Moreover, degranulation of RBL-2H3 
      cells was assessed by measuring the release of β-hexosaminidase, which was 
      suppressed by ST at 10 μg/mL. This study showed an immunomodulatory effect of ST 
      at the cellular level and suggests the role of ST in treating allergic diseases.

TI  - Taurine up-regulated gene 1 functions as a master regulator to coordinate 
      glycolysis and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 188-203
LID - 10.1002/hep.29462 [doi]
AB  - Cancer cells display altered glucose metabolism characterized by a preference for 
      aerobic glycolysis. The aerobic glycolytic phenotype of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) is often correlated with tumor progression and poorer clinical outcomes. 
      However, the issue of whether glycolytic metabolism influences metastasis in HCC 
      remains unclear. In the current study, we showed that knockdown of taurine 
      up-regulated gene 1 (TUG1) induces marked inhibition of cell migration, invasion, 
      and glycolysis through suppression of microRNA (miR)-455-3p. MiR-455-3p, which is 
      transcriptionally repressed by p21, directly targets the 3' untranslated region 
      of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase subunit beta 2 (AMPKβ2). The 
      TUG1/miR-455-3p/AMPKβ2 axis regulates cell growth, metastasis, and glycolysis 
      through regulation of hexokinase 2 (HK2). TUG1 is clearly associated with HK2 
      overexpression and unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients. CONCLUSION: Our data 
      collectively highlight that novel regulatory associations among TUG1, miR-455-3p, 
      AMPKβ2, and HK2 are an important determinant of glycolytic metabolism and 
      metastasis in HCC cells and support the potential utility of targeting TUG1/HK2 
      as a therapeutic strategy for HCC. (Hepatology 2018;67:188-203).

TI  - Chaperonin 60 sustains osteoblast autophagy and counteracts glucocorticoid 
      aggravation of osteoporosis by chaperoning RPTOR.
PG  - 938

LID - 938
AB  - Glucocorticoid excess medication interrupts osteoblast homeostasis and 
      exacerbates bone mass and microstructure loss ramping up the pathogenesis of 
      osteoporotic disorders. Heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) is found to maintain 
      protein function within cellular microenvironment upon encountering detrimental 
      stress. In this study, we revealed that supraphysiological dexamethasone 
      decreased HSP60 expression along with deregulated autophagy in osteoblasts 
      cultures. This chaperonin is required to sustain autophagic markers Atg4, and 
      Atg12 expression, LC3-II conversion, and autophagic puncta formation, and 
      alleviated the glucocorticoid-induced loss of osteogenic gene expression and 
      mineralized matrix accumulation. Regulator-associated protein of mTOR complex 1 
      (RPTOR) existed in HSP60 immunoprecipitate contributing to the HSP60-promoted 
      autophagy and osteogenesis because knocking down RPTOR impaired autophagic influx 
      and osteogenic activity. HSP60 shielded from RPTOR dysfunction by reducing the 
      glucocorticoid-induced RPTOR de-phosphorylation, aggregation, and ubiquitination. 
      In vivo, forced RPTOR expression attenuated the methylprednisolone-induced loss 
      of osteoblast autophagy, bone mass, and trabecular microstructure in mice. HSP60 
      transgenic mice displayed increased cortical bone, mineral acquisition, and 
      osteoblast proliferation along with higher osteogenesis of bone marrow 
      mesenchymal cells than those of wild-type mice. HSP60 overexpression retained 
      RPTOR signaling, sustained osteoblast autophagy, and compromised the severity of 
      glucocorticoid-induced bone loss and sparse trabecular histopathology. Taken 
      together, HSP60 is essential to maintain osteoblast autophagy, which facilitates 
      mineralized matrix production. It fends off glucocorticoid-induced osteoblast 
      apoptosis and bone loss by stabilizing RPTOR action to autophagy. This study 
      offers a new insight into the mechanistic by which chaperonin protects against 
      the glucocorticoid-induced osteoblast dysfunction and bone loss.

AB  - Chondrocyte loss is a prominent feature of osteoarthritis (OA). Autophagy is 
      indispensable in maintaining the metabolic activities of cells exposed to 
      deleterious stress. The contribution of microRNA signaling to chondrocyte 
      autophagy in OA development remains elusive. We uncovered an association between 
      poor autophagy and increased miR-128a expressions in articular chondrocytes of 
      patients with end-stage knee OA and in a rat anterior cruciate ligament 
      transection (ACLT) model for OA development. Cartilage matrix degradation and 
      severe OA histopathology was evident upon forced miR-128a expression within the 
      articular compartment. Intra-articular injections with miR-128a antisense 
      oligonucleotide stabilized chondrocyte autophagy and slowed ACLT-mediated 
      articular tissue destruction, including cartilage erosion, synovitis, osteophyte 
      formation, and subchondral plate damage. In vitro, miR-128 signaling hindered 
      Atg12 expression, LC3-II conversion, and autophagic puncta formation through 
      targeting the 3'-untranslated region of Atg12. It increased apoptotic programs, 
      diminishing cartilage formation capacity of articular chondrocytes. Inactivating 
      histone methyltransferase EZH2 reduced methyl histone H3K27 enrichment in the 
      miR-128a promoter and upregulated miR-128a transcription in inflamed 
      chondrocytes. Taken together, miR-128a-induced Atg12 loss repressed chondrocyte 
      autophagy to aggravate OA progression. EZH2 inactivation caused H3K27 
      hypomethylation to accelerate miR-128a actions. Interruption of miR-128a 
      signaling attenuated chondrocyte dysfunction and delayed OA development. Our data 
      provide new insights into how miR-128a signaling affects chondrocyte survival and 
      articular cartilage anabolism and highlight the potential of miR-128a targeting 
      therapy to alleviate knee OA.

      field trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) is 1 of 3 crops, along with rice and 
      wheat, responsible for more than one-half of all calories consumed around the 
      world. Increasing the yield and stress tolerance of these crops is essential to 
      meet the growing need for food. The cost and speed of plant phenotyping are 
      currently the largest constraints on plant breeding efforts. Datasets linking new 
      types of high-throughput phenotyping data collected from plants to the 
      performance of the same genotypes under agronomic conditions across a wide range 
      of environments are essential for developing new statistical approaches and 
      computer vision-based tools. FINDINGS: A set of maize inbreds-primarily recently 
      off patent lines-were phenotyped using a high-throughput platform at University 
      of Nebraska-Lincoln. These lines have been previously subjected to high-density 
      genotyping and scored for a core set of 13 phenotypes in field trials across 13 
      North American states in 2 years by the Genomes 2 Fields Consortium. A total of 
      485 GB of image data including RGB, hyperspectral, fluorescence, and thermal 
      infrared photos has been released. CONCLUSIONS: Correlations between image-based 
      measurements and manual measurements demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying 
      variation in plant architecture using image data. However, naive approaches to 
      measuring traits such as biomass can introduce nonrandom measurement errors 
      confounded with genotype variation. Analysis of hyperspectral image data 
      demonstrated unique signatures from stem tissue. Integrating heritable phenotypes 
      from high-throughput phenotyping data with field data from different environments 
      can reveal previously unknown factors that influence yield plasticity.

TI  - Microfluidics-enabled phenotyping of a whole population of C. elegans worms over 
      their embryonic and post-embryonic development at single-organism resolution.

AB  - The organism Caenorhabditis elegans is a performant model system for studying 
      human biological processes and diseases, but until now all phenome data are 
      produced as population-averaged read-outs. Monitoring of individual responses to 
      drug treatments would however be more informative. Here, a new strategy to track 
      different phenotypic traits of individual C. elegans nematodes throughout their 
      full life-cycle-i.e., embryonic and post-embryonic development, until adulthood 
      onset, differently from life-span-is presented. In an automated fashion, single 
      worms were synchronized, isolated, and cultured from egg to adulthood in a 
      microfluidic device, where their identity was preserved during their whole 
      development. Several phenotypes were monitored and quantified for each animal, 
      resulting in high-content phenome data. Specifically, the method was validated by 
      analyzing the response of C. elegans to doxycycline, an antibiotic fairly 
      well-known to prolong the development and activate mitochondrial stress-response 
      pathways in different species. Interestingly, the obtained extensive single-worm 
      phenome not only confirmed the dramatic doxycycline effect on the worm 
      developmental delay, but more importantly revealed subtle yet severe 
      treatment-dependent phenotypes that are representative of minority subgroups and 
      would have otherwise stayed hidden in an averaged dataset. Such heterogeneous 
      response started during the embryonic development, which makes essential having a 
      dedicated chip that allows including this early developmental stage in the drug 
      assay. Our approach would therefore allow elucidating pharmaceutical or 
      therapeutic responses that so far were still being overlooked.

TI  - MycoKey Round Table Discussions of Future Directions in Research on Chemical 
      Detection Methods, Genetics and Biodiversity of Mycotoxins.
LID - 10.3390/toxins10030109 [doi]
LID - 109
AB  - MycoKey, an EU-funded Horizon 2020 project, includes a series of "Roundtable 
      Discussions" to gather information on trending research areas in the field of 
      mycotoxicology. This paper includes summaries of the Roundtable Discussions on 
      Chemical Detection and Monitoring of mycotoxins and on the role of genetics and 
      biodiversity in mycotoxin production. Discussions were managed by using the 
      nominal group discussion technique, which generates numerous ideas and provides a 
      ranking for those identified as the most important. Four questions were posed for 
      each research area, as well as two questions that were common to both 
      discussions. Test kits, usually antibody based, were one major focus of the 
      discussions at the Chemical Detection and Monitoring roundtable because of their 
      many favorable features, e.g., cost, speed and ease of use. The second area of 
      focus for this roundtable was multi-mycotoxin detection protocols and the 
      challenges still to be met to enable these protocols to become methods of choice 
      for regulated mycotoxins. For the genetic and biodiversity group, both the depth 
      and the breadth of trending research areas were notable. For some areas, e.g., 
      microbiome studies, the suggested research questions were primarily of a 
      descriptive nature. In other areas, multiple experimental approaches, e.g., 
      transcriptomics, proteomics, RNAi and gene deletions, are needed to understand 
      the regulation of toxin production and mechanisms underlying successful 
      biological controls. Answers to the research questions will provide starting 
      points for developing acceptable prevention and remediation processes. Forging a 
      partnership between scientists and appropriately-placed communications experts 
      was recognized by both groups as an essential step to communicating risks, while 
      retaining overall confidence in the safety of the food supply and the integrity 
      of the food production chain.

AB  - Phenomics is the comprehensive study of phenotypes at every level of biology: 
      from metabolites to organisms. With high throughput technologies increasing the 
      scope of biological discoveries, the field of phenomics has been developing rapid 
      and precise methods to collect, catalog, and analyze phenotypes. Such methods 
      have allowed phenotypic data to be widely used in medical applications, from 
      assisting clinical diagnoses to prioritizing genomic diagnoses. To channel the 
      benefits of phenomics into the field of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), we 
      have recently launched IEMbase, an expert-curated knowledgebase of IEM and their 
      disease-characterizing phenotypes. While our efforts with IEMbase have realized 
      benefits, taking full advantage of phenomics requires a comprehensive curation of 
      IEM phenotypes in core phenomics projects, which is dependent upon contributions 
      from the IEM clinical and research community. Here, we assess the inclusion of 
      IEM biochemical phenotypes in a core phenomics project, the Human Phenotype 
      Ontology. We then demonstrate the utility of biochemical phenotypes using a 
      text-based phenomics method to predict gene-disease relationships, showing that 
      the prediction of IEM genes is significantly better using biochemical rather than 
      clinical profiles. The findings herein provide a motivating goal for the IEM 
      community to expand the computationally accessible descriptions of biochemical 
      phenotypes associated with IEM in phenomics resources.

AB  - Polymorphic phenotypes of mammalian coat coloration have been important to the 
      study of genetics and evolution, but less is known about the inheritance and 
      fitness consequences of individual variation in complex coat pattern traits such 
      as spots and stripes. Giraffe coat markings are highly complex and variable and 
      it has been hypothesized that variation in coat patterns most likely affects 
      fitness by camouflaging neonates against visually hunting predators. We 
      quantified complex coat pattern traits of wild Masai giraffes using image 
      analysis software, determined the similarity of spot pattern traits between 
      mother and offspring, and assessed whether variation in spot pattern traits was 
      related to fitness as measured by juvenile survival. The methods we described 
      could comprise a framework for objective quantification of complex mammal coat 
      pattern traits based on photographic coat pattern data. We demonstrated that some 
      characteristics of giraffe coat spot shape were likely to be heritable, as 
      measured by mother-offspring regression. We found significant variation in 
      juvenile survival among phenotypic groups of neonates defined by multivariate 
      clustering based on spot trait measurement variables. We also found significant 
      variation in neonatal survival associated with spot size and shape covariates. 
      Larger spots (smaller number of spots) and irregularly shaped or rounder spots 
      (smaller aspect ratio) were correlated with increased survival. These findings 
      will inform investigations into developmental and genetic architecture of complex 
      mammal coat patterns and their adaptive value.

AB  - Phantom limb (PLP) as well as residual limb pain (RLP) are still a very 
      significant problem after amputation and their causes are only partially known. 
      Here we tested whether the predisposition for the frequency, duration and 
      intensity of PLP and RLP is shared with other prior chronic pains and/or the 
      presence of postamputation subacute pain. A week preoperatively we collected data 
      using validated questionnaires, a pain diary and interviews on past chronic pain 
      conditions, acute pain, depression, anxiety, pain interference, life control, 
      social support and affective distress and pain ratings one day before the 
      amputation in 52 patients scheduled for limb amputation. In the week 
      postamputation and again three and 12 months thereafter, we collected data on 
      postoperative wound pain, PLP, RLP and non-painful phantom sensation (PLS). 
      Phantom and residual limb pain indices were calculated per patient, integrating 
      the intensity, frequency and duration of past chronic pain, PLP, RLP and PLS into 
      a single value to index the overall burden of pain. We report that acute and 
      chronic pain long before but not on the day before the amputation and subacute 
      pain postamputation significantly predicted up to half of the variance in the 
      incidence and severity of PLP, RLP and PLS 12 months postamputation. Moreover, 
      the severity of these painful sensations at 12 months postamputation was 
      partially predicted by preamputation scores of depression and anxiety. These 
      findings corroborate the hypothesis that chronic pain and non-painful sensations 
      following limb amputation are strongly related to longstanding preoperative 
      chronic pain and to subacute postoperative pain as well as to psychological 
      factors before the amputation that may be inherited and/or acquired (learning- 
      and memory-related). Furthermore, we also confirm that subacute pain 
      postamputation comprises an additional risk factor for long-term painful 
      sensations postamputation. Our results suggest that timely interventions might 
      prevent the development of chronic pain.

TI  - Metabotyping of 30 maize hybrids under early-sowing conditions reveals potential 
      marker-metabolites for breeding.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In Northern Europe, maize early-sowing used to maximize yield may 
      lead to moderate damages of seedlings due to chilling without visual phenotypes. 
      Genetic studies and breeding for chilling tolerance remain necessary, and 
      metabolic markers would be particularly useful in this context. OBJECTIVES: Using 
      an untargeted metabolomic approach on a collection of maize hybrids, our aim was 
      to identify metabolite signatures and/or metabolites associated with chilling 
      responses at the vegetative stage, to search for metabolites differentiating 
      groups of hybrids based on silage-earliness, and to search for marker-metabolites 
      correlated with aerial biomass. METHODS: Thirty genetically-diverse maize dent 
      inbred-lines (Zea mays) crossed to a flint inbred-line were sown in a field to 
      assess metabolite profiles upon cold treatment induced by a modification of 
      sowing date, and characterized with climatic measurements and phenotyping. 
      RESULTS: NMR- and LC-MS-based metabolomic profiling revealed the biological 
      variation of primary and specialized metabolites in young leaves of plants before 
      flowering-stage. The effect of early-sowing on leaf composition was larger than 
      that of genotype, and several metabolites were associated to sowing response. The 
      metabolic distances between genotypes based on leaf compositional data were not 
      related to the genotype admixture groups, and their variability was lower under 
      early-sowing than normal-sowing. Several metabolites or metabolite-features were 
      related to silage-earliness groups in the normal-sowing condition, some of which 
      were confirmed the following year. Correlation networks involving metabolites and 
      aerial biomass suggested marker-metabolites for breeding for chilling tolerance. 
      CONCLUSION: After validation in other experiments and larger genotype panels, 
      these marker-metabolites can contribute to breeding.

AB  - Simões et al. () argued that large matrices are linked to the construction of 
      "problematic" characters, and that those characters negatively affect tree 
      topology. In their re-evaluation of two squamate datasets, however, Simões et al. 
      () simply eliminated what they termed "problematic" characters, rather than 
      recode them. This practice ignores potential sources of phylogenetic information 
      and, if it were to be more widely followed, would inhibit the advancement of the 
      field of systematics. Here, we defend the necessity and inevitability of large 
      morphological (phenomic) datasets and discuss best practices for morphological 
      data collection in contemporary phylogenetics.

TI  - Phenome of pearl quality traits in the mollusc transplant model Pinctada 
      margaritifera.
PG  - 2122
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-20564-1 [doi]
LID - 2122
AB  - The bivalve Pinctada margaritifera exhibits three main transplant phenotypes 
      derived from the donor (from which a mantle graft tissue, the saibo, is excised), 
      the recipient (into which the saibo is implanted with a nucleus, leading to the 
      formation of a pearl sac "chimera") and the cultured pearls themselves. This 
      first phenome study on the species derived from a large experimental graft. 
      Transplant phenotype was assessed at three scales: 1) macro, pearl size, colour, 
      grade, 2) micro, pearl surface microstructure, and 3) molecular, 
      biomineralisation gene expression level in saibo and pearl sac tissues. From 
      donor to pearl, the phenome revealed fine variations of quality traits dependent 
      on the position on the mantle where the saibo was cut, whose variation could 
      overlap with inter-individual donor phenotype differences. A single donor 
      phenotype could therefore produce multiple pearl phenotypes at the scale of the 
      saibo position, mirroring its original activity at the mantle position level and 
      the colour and shape of the shell. This phenome study provides essential 
      information on phenotypic trait architecture enabling us to explore and explain 
      the main biological functions and pave the way for a phenomic project on P. 
      margaritifera that could benefit the pearl industry.

AB  - Molecular marker analysis allow for a rapid and advanced pre-selection and 
      resistance screenings in plant breeding processes. During the phenotyping 
      process, optical sensors have proved their potential to determine and assess the 
      function of the genotype of the breeding material. Thereby, biomarkers for 
      specific disease resistance traits provide valuable information for calibrating 
      optical sensor approaches during early plant-pathogen interactions. In this 
      context, the combination of physiological, metabolic phenotyping and phenomic 
      profiles could establish efficient identification and quantification of relevant 
      genotypes within breeding processes. Experiments were conducted with 
      near-isogenic lines of H. vulgare (susceptible, mildew locus o (mlo) and Mildew 
      locus a (Mla) resistant). Multispectral imaging of barley plants was daily 
      conducted 0-8 days after inoculation (dai) in a high-throughput facility with 10 
      wavelength bands from 400 to 1,000 nm. In parallel, the temporal dynamics of the 
      activities of invertase isoenzymes, as key sink specific enzymes that 
      irreversibly cleave the transport sugar sucrose into the hexose monomers, were 
      profiled in a semi high-throughput approach. The activities of cell wall, 
      cytosolic and vacuole invertase revealed specific dynamics of the activity 
      signatures for susceptible genotypes and genotypes with mlo and Mla based 
      resistances 0-120 hours after inoculation (hai). These patterns could be used to 
      differentiate between interaction types and revealed an early influence of 
      Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei (Bgh) conidia on the specific invertase activity 
      already 0.5 hai. During this early powdery mildew pathogenesis, the reflectance 
      intensity increased in the blue bands and at 690 nm. The Mla resistant plants 
      showed an increased reflectance at 680 and 710 nm and a decreased reflectance in 
      the near infrared bands from 3 dai. Applying a Support Vector Machine 
      classification as a supervised machine learning approach, the pixelwise 
      identification and quantification of powdery mildew diseased barley tissue and 
      hypersensitive response spots were established. This enables an automatic 
      identification of the barley-powdery mildew interaction. The study established a 
      proof-of-concept for plant resistance phenotyping with multispectral imaging in 
      high-throughput. The combination of invertase analysis and multispectral imaging 
      showed to be a complementing validation system. This will provide a deeper 
      understanding of optical data and its implementation into disease resistance 
      screening.

AB  - Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-established modality for the treatment of 
      advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, the detrimental effects of 
      intramedullary reaming used in conventional TKA for distal femur cutting are of 
      concern. Avoiding intramedullary reaming with the use of computer-assisted 
      navigation TKA can not only provide superior prosthetic alignment, but also 
      mitigate perioperative blood loss and the dissipation of marrow emboli. We 
      quantified local and systemic concentrations of inflammation markers for both 
      techniques. Forty-four participants undergoing computer-assisted navigation and 
      53 receiving conventional TKA for advanced knee OA were recruited between 
      2013/02/08 and 2015/12/09. Blood samples were collected from all participants at 
      baseline then again at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively and analyzed by ELISA for 
      interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and transforming 
      growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1); these markers were also measured in Hemovac drain 
      fluid collected at 24 and 72 hours. Serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and 
      TGF-β1(unit for all markers: pg/mL) were increased from baseline by smaller 
      increments in the navigation TKA cohort compared with the conventional TKA group 
      at 24 hours (17.06 vs 29.39, p = 0.02; 0.51 vs 0.83, p = 0.16; -0.04 vs 0.36, p < 
      0.01 and -48.18 vs 63.24, p< 0.01, respectively) and at 72 hours (12.27 vs 16.87, 
      p = 0.01; -0.40 vs 0.48, p < 0.01; 0.58 vs 0.98, p = 0.07 and -55.16 vs 63.71, p 
      < 0.01, respectively). IL-10 levels in drainage fluids collected 24 hours after 
      TKA were also significantly lower in the navigation group versus the conventional 
      TKA group (8.55 vs 12.32, p < 0.01). According to our evidence, the merits of 
      computer-assisted navigation TKA are augmented by low levels of inflammation 
      markers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Shoulder stiffness is a disease manifested by pain, limited range of 
      motion, and functional disability. The inflammatory and fibrosis processes play a 
      substantial role in the pathogenesis of shoulder stiffness. The CB1 receptor has 
      been recognized to mediate the processes of pathologic fibrosis. This study 
      investigated the role of the CB1 pathway in pathogenesis of rotator cuff lesions 
      with shoulder stiffness. METHODS: All of the patients undergoing repair surgery 
      for rotator cuff lesions were recruited and subcategorized into subjects with and 
      without shoulder stiffness. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay 
      was used to evaluate the expression level of CB1 and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in 
      the subacromial bursae, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure 
      the concentration of CB1 and IL-1β in the subacromial fluid. Tenocytes treated 
      with CB1 agonists and antagonists were also studied for the relationship of CB1 
      and the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. RESULTS: The patients with shoulder 
      stiffness had higher messenger RNA (mRNA) expression (P = .040) and 
      immunohistochemistry staining (P < .001) of CB1 in the subacromial bursa and 
      higher CB1 concentration in the subacromial fluid (P = .008). Tenocytes treated 
      with the CB1 agonist WIN 55,212-2 and antagonist AM251 showed increased 
      expression of IL-1β mRNA (P = .049) and suppressed expression of IL-1β mRNA 
      (P = .001), respectively. DISCUSSION: The CB1 pathway is involved in the 
      pathogenesis of shoulder stiffness. It may be a promising target for the 
      treatment of rotator cuff lesions with shoulder stiffness.

PG  - e0196902

LID - e0196902
AB  - Ellipse fitting is a highly researched and mature topic. Surprisingly, however, 
      no existing method has thus far considered the data point eccentricity in its 
      ellipse fitting procedure. Here, we introduce the concept of eccentricity of a 
      data point, in analogy with the idea of ellipse eccentricity. We then show 
      empirically that, irrespective of ellipse fitting method used, the root mean 
      square error (RMSE) of a fit increases with the eccentricity of the data point 
      set. The main contribution of the paper is based on the hypothesis that if the 
      data point set were pre-processed to strategically add additional data points in 
      regions of high eccentricity, then the quality of a fit could be improved. 
      Conditional validity of this hypothesis is demonstrated mathematically using a 
      model scenario. Based on this confirmation we propose an algorithm that 
      pre-processes the data so that data points with high eccentricity are replicated. 
      The improvement of ellipse fitting is then demonstrated empirically in real-world 
      application of 3D reconstruction of a plant root system for phenotypic analysis. 
      The degree of improvement for different underlying ellipse fitting methods as a 
      function of data noise level is also analysed. We show that almost every method 
      tested, irrespective of whether it minimizes algebraic error or geometric error, 
      shows improvement in the fit following data augmentation using the proposed 
      pre-processing algorithm.

TI  - Optimization of native biocontrol agents, with parasitoids of the invasive pest 
      Drosophila suzukii as an example.
PG  - 1473-1497
LID - 10.1111/eva.12648 [doi]
AB  - The development of biological control methods for exotic invasive pest species 
      has become more challenging during the last decade. Compared to indigenous 
      natural enemies, species from the pest area of origin are often more efficient 
      due to their long coevolutionary history with the pest. The import of these 
      well-adapted exotic species, however, has become restricted under the Nagoya 
      Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing, reducing the number of available 
      biocontrol candidates. Finding new agents and ways to improve important traits 
      for control agents ("biocontrol traits") is therefore of crucial importance. 
      Here, we demonstrate the potential of a surprisingly under-rated method for 
      improvement of biocontrol: the exploitation of intraspecific variation in 
      biocontrol traits, for example, by selective breeding. We propose a four-step 
      approach to investigate the potential of this method: investigation of the amount 
      of (a) inter- and (b) intraspecific variation for biocontrol traits, (c) 
      determination of the environmental and genetic factors shaping this variation, 
      and (d) exploitation of this variation in breeding programs. We illustrate this 
      approach with a case study on parasitoids of Drosophila suzukii, a highly 
      invasive pest species in Europe and North America. We review all known 
      parasitoids of D. suzukii and find large variation among and within species in 
      their ability to kill this fly. We then consider which genetic and environmental 
      factors shape the interaction between D. suzukii and its parasitoids to explain 
      this variation. Insight into the causes of variation informs us on how and to 
      what extent candidate agents can be improved. Moreover, it aids in predicting the 
      effectiveness of the agent upon release and provides insight into the selective 
      forces that are limiting the adaptation of indigenous species to the new pest. We 
      use this knowledge to give future research directions for the development of 
      selective breeding methods for biocontrol agents.

TI  - Maternal sepsis in the era of genomic medicine.
PG  - 49-60
LID - 10.1007/s00404-017-4584-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Maternal sepsis remains one of the leading causes of direct and indirect 
      maternal mortality both in high- and low-income environments. In the last two 
      decades, systems biology approaches, based on '-omics' technologies, have started 
      revolutionizing the diagnosis and management of the septic syndrome. The scope of 
      this narrative review is to present an overview of the basic '-omics' 
      technologies, exemplified by cases relevant to maternal sepsis. METHODS: 
      Narrative review of the new '-omics' technologies based on a detailed review of 
      the literature. RESULTS: After presenting the main 'omics' technologies, we 
      discuss their limitations and the need for integrated approaches that encompass 
      research efforts across multiple '-omics' layers in the '-omics' cascade between 
      the genome and the phenome. CONCLUSIONS: Systems biology approaches are 
      revolutionizing the research landscape in maternal sepsis. There is a need for 
      increased awareness, from the side of health practitioners, as a requirement for 
      the effective implementation of the new technologies in the research and clinical 
      practice in maternal sepsis.

TI  - The histone acetyltransferase GCN5 and the transcriptional coactivator ADA2b 
      affect leaf development and trichome morphogenesis in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 613-628

AB  - The histone acetyltransferase GCN5 and associated transcriptional coactivator 
      ADA2b are required to couple endoreduplication and trichome branching. Mutation 
      of ADA2b also disrupts the relationship between ploidy and leaf cell size. 
      Dynamic chromatin structure has been established as a general mechanism by which 
      gene function is temporally and spatially regulated, but specific chromatin 
      modifier function is less well understood. To address this question, we have 
      investigated the role of the histone acetyltransferase GCN5 and the associated 
      coactivator ADA2b in developmental events in Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis 
      plants with T-DNA insertions in GCN5 (also known as HAG1) or ADA2b (also known as 
      PROPORZ1) display pleiotropic phenotypes including dwarfism and floral defects 
      affecting fertility. We undertook a detailed characterization of gcn5 and ada2b 
      phenotypic effects in rosette leaves and trichomes to establish a role for 
      epigenetic control in these developmental processes. ADA2b and GCN5 play specific 
      roles in leaf tissue, affecting cell growth and division in rosette leaves often 
      in complex and even opposite directions. Leaves of gcn5 plants display overall 
      reduced ploidy levels, while ada2b-1 leaves show increased ploidy. 
      Endoreduplication leading to increased ploidy is also known to contribute to 
      normal trichome morphogenesis. We demonstrate that gcn5 and ada2b mutants display 
      alterations in the number and patterning of trichome branches, with ada2b-1 and 
      gcn5-1 trichomes being significantly less branched, while gcn5-6 trichomes show 
      increased branching. Elongation of the trichome stalk and branches also vary in 
      different mutant backgrounds, with stalk length having an inverse relationship 
      with branch number. Taken together, our data indicate that, in Arabidopsis, 
      leaves and trichomes ADA2b and GCN5 are required to couple nuclear content with 
      cell growth and morphogenesis.

TI  - Genetics of blood lipids among ~300,000 multi-ethnic participants of the Million 
      Veteran Program.

LID - 10.1038/s41588-018-0222-9 [doi]
AB  - The Million Veteran Program (MVP) was established in 2011 as a national research 
      initiative to determine how genetic variation influences the health of US 
      military veterans. Here we genotyped 312,571 MVP participants using a custom 
      biobank array and linked the genetic data to laboratory and clinical phenotypes 
      extracted from electronic health records covering a median of 10.0 years of 
      follow-up. Among 297,626 veterans with at least one blood lipid measurement, 
      including 57,332 black and 24,743 Hispanic participants, we tested up to around 
      32 million variants for association with lipid levels and identified 118 novel 
      genome-wide significant loci after meta-analysis with data from the Global Lipids 
      Genetics Consortium (total n > 600,000). Through a focus on mutations predicted 
      to result in a loss of gene function and a phenome-wide association study, we 
      propose novel indications for pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting PCSK9 
      (abdominal aortic aneurysm), ANGPTL4 (type 2 diabetes) and PDE3B (triglycerides 
      and coronary disease).

TI  - Preanalytical Processing and Biobanking Procedures of Biological Samples for 
      Metabolomics Research: A White Paper, Community Perspective (for "Precision 
      Medicine and Pharmacometabolomics Task Group"-The Metabolomics Society 
      Initiative).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The metabolome of any given biological system contains a diverse 
      range of low molecular weight molecules (metabolites), whose abundances can be 
      affected by the timing and method of sample collection, storage, and handling. 
      Thus, it is necessary to consider the requirements for preanalytical processes 
      and biobanking in metabolomics research. Poor practice can create bias and have 
      deleterious effects on the robustness and reproducibility of acquired data. 
      CONTENT: This review presents both current practice and latest evidence on 
      preanalytical processes and biobanking of samples intended for metabolomics 
      measurement of common biofluids and tissues. It highlights areas requiring more 
      validation and research and provides some evidence-based guidelines on best 
      practices. SUMMARY: Although many researchers and biobanking personnel are 
      familiar with the necessity of standardizing sample collection procedures at the 
      axiomatic level (e.g., fasting status, time of day, "time to freezer," sample 
      volume), other less obvious factors can also negatively affect the validity of a 
      study, such as vial size, material and batch, centrifuge speeds, storage 
      temperature, time and conditions, and even environmental changes in the 
      collection room. Any biobank or research study should establish and follow a 
      well-defined and validated protocol for the collection of samples for 
      metabolomics research. This protocol should be fully documented in any resulting 
      study and should involve all stakeholders in its design. The use of samples that 
      have been collected using standardized and validated protocols is a prerequisite 
      to enable robust biological interpretation unhindered by unnecessary 
      preanalytical factors that may complicate data analysis and interpretation.

TI  - Polygenic analysis suggests the involvement of calcium signaling in executive 
      function in schizophrenia patients.
PG  - 425-431

AB  - Cognitive deficits are increasingly recognized as a core dimension rather than a 
      consequence of schizophrenia (SCZ). The previous evidence supports the hypothesis 
      of shared genetic factors between SCZ and cognitive ability. The objective of 
      this study was to test whether and to what extent the variation of 
      disease-relevant neurocognitive function in a sample of SCZ patients from the 
      previous clinical interventional studies can be explained by SCZ polygenic risk 
      scores (PRSs) or by hypothesis-driven and biomedical PRSs. The previous studies 
      have described associations of the SNAP25 gene with cognition in SCZ. Likewise, 
      the enrichment of several calcium signaling-related gene sets has been reported 
      by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in SCZ. Hypothesis-driven PRSs were 
      calculated on the basis of the SNAP-25 interactome and also for genes regulated 
      by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), an activator of the signal transduction of 
      protein kinase C (PKC) enzymes. In a cohort of 127 SCZ patients who had completed 
      a comprehensive neurocognitive test battery as part of the previous antipsychotic 
      intervention studies, we investigated the association between neurocognitive 
      dimensions and PRSs. The PRS for SCZ and SNAP-25-associated genes could not 
      explain the variance of neurocognition in this cohort. At a p value threshold of 
      0.05, the PRS for PMA was able to explain 2% of the variance in executive 
      function (p = 0.05, uncorrected). The correlation between the PRS for 
      PMA-regulated genes and cognition can give hints for further patient-derived 
      cellular assays. In conclusion, incorporating biological information into PRSs 
      and other en masse genetic analyses may help to close the gap between genetic 
      vulnerability and the biological processes underlying neuropsychiatric diseases 
      such as SCZ.

AB  - Pulmonary immunity requires tight regulation, as interstitial inflammation can 
      compromise gas exchange and lead to respiratory failure. Here we found a greater 
      number of aged CD11b(hi)L-selectin(lo)CXCR4(+) polymorphonuclear leukocytes 
      (PMNs) in lung vasculature than in the peripheral circulation. Using pulmonary 
      intravital microscopy, we observed lung PMNs physically interacting with B cells 
      via β(2) integrins; this initiated neutrophil apoptosis, which led to 
      macrophage-mediated clearance. Genetic deletion of B cells led to the 
      accumulation of aged PMNs in the lungs without systemic inflammation, which 
      caused pathological fibrotic interstitial lung disease that was attenuated by the 
      adoptive transfer of B cells or depletion of PMNs. Thus, the lungs are an 
      intermediary niche in the PMN lifecycle wherein aged PMNs are regulated by B 
      cells, which restrains their potential to cause pulmonary pathology.

AB  - Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) is an industrial model microbe for the mass-production 
      of bioproducts such as biofuels, biorefineries, and recombinant proteins. 
      However, despite its important role in scientific research and biotechnological 
      applications, a high-quality metabolic network model for metabolic engineering is 
      yet to be developed. Here, we present the comprehensive metabolic network model 
      of E. coli BL21(DE3), named iHK1487, based on the latest genome reannotation and 
      phenome analysis. The metabolic model consists of 1,164 unique metabolites, 2,701 
      metabolic reactions, and 1,487 genes. The model was validated and improved by 
      comparing the simulation results with phenome data from phenotype microarray 
      tests. Previous transcriptome profile data was incorporated during model 
      reconstruction, and flux prediction was simulated using the model. iHK1487 was 
      simulated to explore the metabolic features of BL21(DE3) such as broad spectrum 
      amino acid utilization and enhanced flux through the upper glycolytic pathway and 
      TCA cycle. iHK1487 will contribute to systematic understanding of cellular 
      physiology and metabolism of E. coli BL21(DE3) and highlight its biotechnological 
      applications.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) (C342Y/+) mutation is a 
      known cause of Crouzon syndrome that is characterised by craniosynostosis and 
      midfacial hypoplasia. Our aim was to conduct extensive phenotyping of the 
      maxillary, mandibular and dental morphology associated with this mutation. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Morphometric data were obtained from 40 mice, representing 
      two genotypes (Crouzon and wild-type) and two sexes (males and females) (n=10 in 
      each group). Dental analysis further categorised the first molars into the two 
      jaws (maxillary and mandibular) (n=20 in each group). Maxillary, mandibular and 
      dental morphology was compared by analysing 23 linear landmark-based dimensions 
      in three-dimensional micro-computed tomography reconstructions. RESULTS: Compared 
      with wild-type, Crouzon (FGFR2(C342Y/+)) maxillae were significantly shorter in 
      maximum height, anterior and posterior lengths and middle width, but larger in 
      posterior width (p<0.05 for height; p<0.001 for other comparisons). In the 
      Crouzon mandible, the ascending and descending heights, effective and mandibular 
      lengths, and intercoronoid and intercondylar widths were significantly shorter, 
      whereas intergonial width was larger (p<0.01 for intercondylar width; p<0.001 for 
      other comparisons). Crouzon teeth were significantly smaller mesiodistally, but 
      larger in crown height (p<0.001 for each comparison). All Crouzon mice presented 
      with bifid mandibular condyles and a quarter presented with expansive bone 
      lesions in the mandibular incisor alveolus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of 
      hypoplasia in all three planes in Crouzon maxillae and mandibles, together with 
      the presence of bifid mandibular condyles and expansive bone lesions, may be 
      relevant to maxillofacial surgery and orthodontics. Beyond skeletal effects, the 
      FGFR2(C342Y/+) mutation is now implicated in affecting tooth development. This

AB  - Enterococci are important human commensals and significant opportunistic 
      pathogens. Biofilm-related enterococcal infections, such as endocarditis, urinary 
      tract infections, wound and surgical site infections, and medical 
      device-associated infections, often become chronic upon the formation of biofilm. 
      The biofilm matrix establishes properties that distinguish this state from 
      free-living bacterial cells and increase tolerance to antimicrobial 
      interventions. The metabolic versatility of the enterococci is reflected in the 
      diversity and complexity of environments and communities in which they thrive. 
      Understanding metabolic factors governing colonization and persistence in 
      different host niches can reveal factors influencing the transition to biofilm 
      pathogenicity. Here, we report a form of iron-dependent metabolism for 
      Enterococcus faecalis where, in the absence of heme, extracellular electron 
      transfer (EET) and increased ATP production augment biofilm growth. We observe 
      alterations in biofilm matrix depth and composition during iron-augmented biofilm 
      growth. We show that the ldh gene encoding l-lactate dehydrogenase is required 
      for iron-augmented energy production and biofilm formation and promotes 
      EET.IMPORTANCE Bacterial metabolic versatility can often influence the outcome of 
      host-pathogen interactions, yet causes of metabolic shifts are difficult to 
      resolve. The bacterial biofilm matrix provides the structural and functional 
      support that distinguishes this state from free-living bacterial cells. Here, we 
      show that the biofilm matrix can immobilize iron, providing access to this 
      growth-promoting resource which is otherwise inaccessible in the planktonic 
      state. Our data show that in the absence of heme, Enterococcus faecalis l-lactate 
      dehydrogenase promotes EET and uses matrix-associated iron to carry out EET. 
      Therefore, the presence of iron within the biofilm matrix leads to enhanced 
      biofilm growth.

TI  - The cytochrome P450 CYP77A4 is involved in auxin-mediated patterning of the 
      Arabidopsis thaliana embryo.

LID - 10.1242/dev.168369 [doi]
AB  - Metabolism often plays an important role in developmental control, in addition to 
      supporting basal physiological requirements. However, our understanding of this 
      interaction remains limited. Here, we performed quantitative phenome analysis of 
      Arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome P450 mutants to identify a novel interaction 
      between development and metabolism. We found that cyp77a4 mutants exhibit 
      specific defects in cotyledon development, including asymmetric positioning and 
      cup-shaped morphology, which could be rescued by introducing the CYP77A4 gene. 
      Microscopy revealed that the abnormal patterning was detected at least from the 
      8-cell stage of the cyp77a4 embryos. We next analysed auxin distribution in 
      mutant embryos, as the phenotypes resembled those of auxin-related mutants. We 
      found that the auxin response pattern was severely perturbed in the cyp77a4 
      embryos owing to an aberrant distribution of the auxin efflux carrier PIN1. 
      CYP77A4 intracellularly localised to the endoplasmic reticulum, which is 
      consistent with the notion that this enzyme acts as an epoxidase of unsaturated 
      fatty acids in the microsomal fraction. We propose that the CYP77A4-dependent 
      metabolic pathway is an essential element for the establishment of polarity in 
      plant embryos.

TI  - Effects of sedative drug use on the dopamine system: a systematic review and

PG  - 660-667

AB  - Use of alcohol, cannabis and opioids is highly prevalent and is associated with 
      global disease burden and high economic costs. The exact pathophysiology of abuse 
      or addiction associated with these sedative substances is not completely 
      understood, but previous research implicates the important role of the striatal 
      dopamine system in the addiction process. Multiple studies investigated changes 
      in the striatal dopamine systems of users of sedative substances, but currently 
      these results are very heterogeneous. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of 
      in vivo neuroimaging studies investigating dopaminergic alterations in the 
      striatum of users of alcohol, opioids or cannabis. Analyses for each substance 
      were conducted separately for the availability of D2/D3 dopamine receptors, 
      dopamine transporters and dopamine synthesis capacity. In total, 723 substance 
      users and 752 healthy controls were included. The results indicated a significant 
      lower striatal D2/D3 receptor availability in alcohol users compared to controls 
      (g = 0.46) but no difference in dopamine transporter availability or dopamine 
      synthesis capacity. Our analysis indicated that changes of dopamine receptors and 
      transporters are moderated by the duration of abstinence. Comparing opioid users 
      with controls revealed a significant lower D2/D3 receptor availability (g = 1.17) 
      and a significantly lower transporter availability (g = 1.55) in opioid users. 
      For cannabis users, there was no significant difference in receptor availability 
      compared to controls and too few studies provided information on dopamine 
      transporter availability or synthesis capacity. Our analysis provides strong 
      evidence for a central role of the striatal dopamine system in use of alcohol or 
      opioids. Further studies are needed to clarify the impact of the dopamine system 
      in cannabis users.

TI  - Culturomics: A New Kid on the Block of OMICS to Enable Personalized Medicine.
PG  - 108-118
LID - 10.1089/omi.2017.0017 [doi]
AB  - This innovation analysis highlights the underestimated and versatile potential of 
      the new field of culturomics and examines its relation to other OMICS system 
      sciences such as infectiomics, metabolomics, phenomics, and pharmacomicrobiomics. 
      The advent of molecular biology, followed by the emergence of various disciplines 
      of the genomics, and most importantly metagenomics, brought about the sharp 
      decline of conventional microbiology methods. Emergence of culturomics has a 
      natural synergy with therapeutic and clinical genomic approaches so as to realize 
      personalized medicine. Notably, the concept of culturomics expands on that of 
      phenomics and allows a reintroduction of the culture-based phenotypic 
      characterization into the 21st century research repertoire, bolstered by robust 
      technology for automated and massive execution, but its potential is largely 
      unappreciated at present; the few available references show unenthusiastic 
      pursuit and in narrow applications. This has not to be so: depending on the 
      specific brand of culturomics, the scope of applications may extend to medicine, 
      agriculture, environmental sciences, pharmacomicrobiomics, and biotechnology 
      innovation. Moreover, culturomics may produce Big Data. This calls for a new 
      generation of data scientists and innovative ways of harnessing and valorizing 
      Big Data beyond classical genomics. Much more detailed and objective 
      classification and identification of microbiota may soon be at hand through 
      culturomics, thus enabling precision diagnosis toward truly personalized

TI  - Investigating polygenic burden in age at disease onset in bipolar disorder: 
      Findings from an international multicentric study.
PG  - 68-75
LID - 10.1111/bdi.12659 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bipolar disorder (BD) with early disease onset is associated with an 
      unfavorable clinical outcome and constitutes a clinically and biologically 
      homogenous subgroup within the heterogeneous BD spectrum. Previous studies have 
      found an accumulation of early age at onset (AAO) in BD families and have 
      therefore hypothesized that there is a larger genetic contribution to the 
      early-onset cases than to late onset BD. To investigate the genetic background of 
      this subphenotype, we evaluated whether an increased polygenic burden of BD- and 
      schizophrenia (SCZ)-associated risk variants is associated with an earlier AAO in 
      BD patients. METHODS: A total of 1995 BD type 1 patients from the Consortium of 
      Lithium Genetics (ConLiGen), PsyCourse and Bonn-Mannheim samples were genotyped 
      and their BD and SCZ polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were calculated using the 
      summary statistics of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium as a training data set. 
      AAO was either separated into onset groups of clinical interest (childhood and 
      adolescence [≤18 years] vs adulthood [>18 years]) or considered as a continuous 
      measure. The associations between BD- and SCZ-PRSs and AAO were evaluated with 
      regression models. RESULTS: BD- and SCZ-PRSs were not significantly associated 
      with age at disease onset. Results remained the same when analyses were 
      stratified by site of recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: The current study is the largest 
      conducted so far to investigate the association between the cumulative BD and SCZ 
      polygenic risk and AAO in BD patients. The reported negative results suggest that 
      such a polygenic influence, if there is any, is not large, and highlight the 
      importance of conducting further, larger scale studies to obtain more information 
      on the genetic architecture of this clinically relevant phenotype.

TI  - Identification of Positively and Negatively Selected Driver Gene Mutations 
      Associated With Colorectal Cancer With Microsatellite Instability.
PG  - 277-300

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recent studies have shown that cancers arise as a result of 
      the positive selection of driver somatic events in tumor DNA, with negative 
      selection playing only a minor role, if any. However, these investigations were 
      concerned with alterations at nonrepetitive sequences and did not take into 
      account mutations in repetitive sequences that have very high pathophysiological 
      relevance in the tumors showing microsatellite instability (MSI) resulting from 
      mismatch repair deficiency investigated in the present study. METHODS: We 
      performed whole-exome sequencing of 47 MSI colorectal cancers (CRCs) and 
      confirmed results in an independent cohort of 53 MSI CRCs. We used a 
      probabilistic model of mutational events within microsatellites, while adapting 
      pre-existing models to analyze nonrepetitive DNA sequences. Negatively selected 
      coding alterations in MSI CRCs were investigated for their functional and 
      clinical impact in CRC cell lines and in a third cohort of 164 MSI CRC patients. 
      RESULTS: Both positive and negative selection of somatic mutations in DNA repeats 
      was observed, leading us to identify the expected true driver genes associated 
      with the MSI-driven tumorigenic process. Several coding negatively selected 
      MSI-related mutational events (n = 5) were shown to have deleterious effects on 
      tumor cells. In the tumors in which deleterious MSI mutations were observed 
      despite the negative selection, they were associated with worse survival in MSI 
      CRC patients (hazard ratio, 3; 95% CI, 1.1-7.9; P = .03), suggesting their 
      anticancer impact should be offset by other as yet unknown oncogenic processes 
      that contribute to a poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The present results identify 
      the positive and negative driver somatic mutations acting in MSI-driven 
      tumorigenesis, suggesting that genomic instability in MSI CRC plays a dual role 
      in achieving tumor cell transformation. Exome sequencing data have been deposited 
      in the European genome-phenome archive (accession: EGAS00001002477).

AB  - One of the key pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the existence 
      of extracellular deposition of amyloid plaques formed with misfolded amyloid-β 
      (Aβ). The conformational change of proteins leads to enriched contents of β 
      sheets, resulting in remarkable changes of vibrational spectra, especially the 
      spectral shifts of the amide I mode. Here, we applied stimulated Raman scattering 
      (SRS) microscopy to image amyloid plaques in the brain tissue of an AD mouse 
      model. We have demonstrated the capability of SRS microscopy as a rapid, 
      label-free imaging modality to differentiate misfolded from normal proteins based 
      on the blue shift (~10 cm(-1)) of amide I SRS spectra. Furthermore, SRS imaging 
      of Aβ plaques was verified by antibody staining of frozen thin sections and 
      fluorescence imaging of fresh tissues. Our method may provide a new approach for 
      studies of AD pathology, as well as other neurodegenerative diseases associated 
      with protein misfolding.

AB  - We report an extensive 600 MHz NMR trial of quantitative lipoprotein and 
      small-molecule measurements in human blood serum and plasma. Five centers with 
      eleven 600 MHz NMR spectrometers were used to analyze 98 samples including 20 
      quality controls (QCs), 37 commercially sourced, paired serum and plasma samples, 
      and two National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) reference material 
      1951c replicates. Samples were analyzed using rigorous protocols for sample 
      preparation and experimental acquisition. A commercial lipoprotein subclass 
      analysis was used to quantify 105 lipoprotein subclasses and 24 low molecular 
      weight metabolites from the NMR spectra. For all spectrometers, the instrument 
      specific variance in measuring internal QCs was lower than the percentage 
      described by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria for lipid 
      testing [triglycerides <2.7%; cholesterol <2.8%; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
      cholesterol <2.8%; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol <2.3%], showing 
      exceptional reproducibility for direct quantitation of lipoproteins in both 
      matrixes. The average relative standard deviations (RSDs) for the 105 lipoprotein 
      parameters in the 11 instruments were 4.6% and 3.9% for the two NIST samples, 
      whereas they were 38% and 40% for the 37 commercially sourced plasmas and sera, 
      respectively, showing negligible analytical compared to biological variation. The 
      coefficient of variance (CV) obtained for the quantification of the small 
      molecules across the 11 spectrometers was below 15% for 20 out of the 24 
      metabolites analyzed. This study provides further evidence of the suitability of 
      NMR for high-throughput lipoprotein subcomponent analysis and small-molecule 
      quantitation with the exceptional required reproducibility for clinical and other 
      regulatory settings.

TI  - High Throughput Determination of Plant Height, Ground Cover, and Above-Ground 
      Biomass in Wheat with LiDAR.

AB  - Crop improvement efforts are targeting increased above-ground biomass and 
      radiation-use efficiency as drivers for greater yield. Early ground cover and 
      canopy height contribute to biomass production, but manual measurements of these 
      traits, and in particular above-ground biomass, are slow and labor-intensive, 
      more so when made at multiple developmental stages. These constraints limit the 
      ability to capture these data in a temporal fashion, hampering insights that 
      could be gained from multi-dimensional data. Here we demonstrate the capacity of 
      Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), mounted on a lightweight, mobile, 
      ground-based platform, for rapid multi-temporal and non-destructive estimation of 
      canopy height, ground cover and above-ground biomass. Field validation of LiDAR 
      measurements is presented. For canopy height, strong relationships with LiDAR 
      (r(2) of 0.99 and root mean square error of 0.017 m) were obtained. Ground cover 
      was estimated from LiDAR using two methodologies: red reflectance image and 
      canopy height. In contrast to NDVI, LiDAR was not affected by saturation at high 
      ground cover, and the comparison of both LiDAR methodologies showed strong 
      association (r(2) = 0.92 and slope = 1.02) at ground cover above 0.8. For 
      above-ground biomass, a dedicated field experiment was performed with destructive 
      biomass sampled eight times across different developmental stages. Two 
      methodologies are presented for the estimation of biomass from LiDAR: 3D voxel 
      index (3DVI) and 3D profile index (3DPI). The parameters involved in the 
      calculation of 3DVI and 3DPI were optimized for each sample event from tillering 
      to maturity, as well as generalized for any developmental stage. Individual 
      sample point predictions were strong while predictions across all eight sample 
      events, provided the strongest association with biomass (r(2) = 0.93 and r(2) = 
      0.92) for 3DPI and 3DVI, respectively. Given these results, we believe that 
      application of this system will provide new opportunities to deliver improved 
      genotypes and agronomic interventions via more efficient and reliable phenotyping 
      of these important traits in large experiments.

      Data Analysis.

LID - 347
AB  - The mainstream of research in genetics, epigenetics, and imaging data analysis 
      focuses on statistical association or exploring statistical dependence between 
      variables. Despite their significant progresses in genetic research, 
      understanding the etiology and mechanism of complex phenotypes remains elusive. 
      Using association analysis as a major analytical platform for the complex data 
      analysis is a key issue that hampers the theoretic development of genomic science 
      and its application in practice. Causal inference is an essential component for 
      the discovery of mechanical relationships among complex phenotypes. Many 
      researchers suggest making the transition from association to causation. Despite 
      its fundamental role in science, engineering, and biomedicine, the traditional 
      methods for causal inference require at least three variables. However, 
      quantitative genetic analysis such as QTL, eQTL, mQTL, and genomic-imaging data 
      analysis requires exploring the causal relationships between two variables. This 
      paper will focus on bivariate causal discovery with continuous variables. We will 
      introduce independence of cause and mechanism (ICM) as a basic principle for 
      causal inference, algorithmic information theory and additive noise model (ANM) 
      as major tools for bivariate causal discovery. Large-scale simulations will be 
      performed to evaluate the feasibility of the ANM for bivariate causal discovery. 
      To further evaluate their performance for causal inference, the ANM will be 
      applied to the construction of gene regulatory networks. Also, the ANM will be 
      applied to trait-imaging data analysis to illustrate three scenarios: presence of 
      both causation and association, presence of association while absence of 
      causation, and presence of causation, while lack of association between two 
      variables. Telling cause from effect between two continuous variables from 
      observational data is one of the fundamental and challenging problems in omics 
      and imaging data analysis. Our preliminary simulations and real data analysis 
      will show that the ANMs will be one of choice for bivariate causal discovery in 
      genomic and imaging data analysis.

TI  - Low Bone Mineral Density Is Not Associated with Subclinical Atherosclerosis: A 
      Population-Based Study in Rural China.
PG  - 78-87
LID - 10.1159/000493166 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Loss of bone mass may affect the progression of atherosclerosis. We 
      investigated the relationship between low bone mineral density (BMD) and 
      subclinical atherosclerosis in rural China. METHODS: In total, 333 men and 421 
      postmenopausal women aged 55-65 years were enrolled. BMD was measured in the 
      lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. 
      Subclinical atherosclerosis was defined as increased carotid artery intima-media 
      thickness (CIMT ≥0.9 mm), the presence of carotid plaques, high brachial-ankle 
      pulse wave velocity (baPWV ≥1,400 cm/s), and low ankle-brachial index (ABI ≤1). 
      Binary logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between 
      low BMD and subclinical atherosclerosis. RESULTS: There was no significant 
      difference in BMD between the normal group and the subclinical atherosclerosis 
      group. After full adjustment for the relevant covariates, a boundary significant 
      association was found between low BMD in the femoral neck and baPWV in 
      postmenopausal women (odds ratio = 1.77, p = 0.049). After full adjustment, 
      neither BMD nor low BMD were significantly associated with subclinical 
      atherosclerosis in men or postmenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: Low BMD is not

AB  - Epigenetic alteration of tumor suppression gene is one of the most significant 
      indicators in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In this study, we 
      identified a novel ESCC hypermethylation biomarker ZNF132 by integrative 
      computational analysis to comprehensive genome-wide DNA methylation microarray 
      dataset. We validated the hypermethylation status of ZNF132 in 91 Chinese Han 
      ESCC patients and adjacent normal tissues with methylation target bisulfite 
      sequencing (MTBS) assay. Meanwhile, ZNF132 gene silencing mediated by 
      hypermethylation was confirmed in both solid tissues and cancer cell lines. What 
      is more, we found that in vitro overexpression of ZNF132 in ESCC cells could 
      significantly reduce the abilities of the cell in growth, migration and invasion, 
      and tumorigenicity of cells in a nude mouse model. We validated the Sp1-binding 
      site in the ZNF132 promoter region with chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and 
      demonstrated that the hypermethylation status could reduce the Sp1 transcript 
      factor activity. Our results suggest that ZNF132 plays an important role in the 
      development of ESCC as a tumor suppressor gene and support the underlying 
      mechanism caused by the DNA hypermethylation-mediated Sp1-binding decay and gene 
      silencing.

AB  - The genetic regulation and physiological impact of most lipid species are 
      unexplored. Here, we profiled 129 plasma lipid species across 49 strains of the 
      BXD mouse genetic reference population fed either chow or a high-fat diet. By 
      integrating these data with genomics and phenomics datasets, we elucidated genes 
      by environment (diet) interactions that regulate systemic metabolism. We found 
      quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for ∼94% of the lipids measured. Several QTLs 
      harbored genes associated with blood lipid levels and abnormal lipid metabolism 
      in human genome-wide association studies. Lipid species from different classes 
      provided signatures of metabolic health, including seven plasma triglyceride 
      species that associated with either healthy or fatty liver. This observation was 
      further validated in an independent mouse model of non-alcoholic fatty liver 
      disease (NAFLD) and in plasma from NAFLD patients. This work provides a resource 
      to identify plausible genes regulating the measured lipid species and their 
      association with metabolic traits.

TI  - Using Human 'Experiments of Nature' to Predict Drug Safety Issues: An Example 
      with PCSK9 Inhibitors.
PG  - 303-311
LID - 10.1007/s40264-017-0616-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: When a new drug enters the market, its full array of side effects 
      remains to be defined. Current surveillance approaches targeting these effects 
      remain largely reactive. There is a need for development of methods to predict 
      specific safety events that should be sought for a given new drug during 
      development and postmarketing activities. OBJECTIVE: We present here a safety 
      signal identification approach applied to a new set of drug entities, inhibitors 
      of the serine protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). 
      METHODS: Using phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) methods, we analyzed 
      available genotype and clinical data from 29,722 patients, leveraging the known 
      effects of changes in PCSK9 to identify novel phenotypes in which this protein 
      and its inhibitors may have impact. RESULTS: PheWAS revealed a significantly 
      reduced risk of hypercholesterolemia (odds ratio [OR] 0.68, p = 7.6 × 10(-4)) in 
      association with a known loss-of-function variant in PCSK9, R46L. Similarly, 
      laboratory data indicated significantly reduced beta mean low-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol (- 14.47 mg/dL, p = 2.58 × 10(-23)) in individuals carrying the R46L 
      variant. The R46L variant was also associated with an increased risk of spina 
      bifida (OR 5.90, p = 2.7 × 10(-4)), suggesting that further investigation of 
      potential connections between inhibition of PCSK9 and neural tube defects may be 
      warranted. CONCLUSION: This novel methodology provides an opportunity to put in 
      place new mechanisms to assess the safety and long-term tolerability of PCSK9 
      inhibitors specifically, and other new agents in general, as they move into human 
      testing and expanded clinical use.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of kisspeptin on glucose-stimulated insulin 
      secretion and appetite in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 15 healthy men (age: 
      25.2 ± 1.1 years; BMI: 22.3 ± 0.5 kg m(-2) ), we compared the effects of 1 
      nmol kg(-1) h(-1) kisspeptin versus vehicle administration on glucose-stimulated 
      insulin secretion, metabolites, gut hormones, appetite and food intake. In 
      addition, we assessed the effect of kisspeptin on glucose-stimulated insulin 
      secretion in vitro in human pancreatic islets and a human β-cell line (EndoC-βH1 
      cells). RESULTS: Kisspeptin administration to healthy men enhanced insulin 
      secretion following an intravenous glucose load, and modulated serum metabolites. 
      In keeping with this, kisspeptin increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion 
      from human islets and a human pancreatic cell line in vitro. In addition, 
      kisspeptin administration did not alter gut hormones, appetite or food intake in 
      healthy men. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data demonstrate for the first time 
      a beneficial role for kisspeptin in insulin secretion in humans in vivo. This has 
      important implications for our understanding of the links between reproduction 
      and metabolism in humans, as well as for the ongoing translational development of 
      kisspeptin-based therapies for reproductive and potentially metabolic conditions.

AB  - The current paradigm of genomic studies of complex diseases is association and 
      correlation analysis. Despite significant progress in dissecting the genetic 
      architecture of complex diseases by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the 
      identified genetic variants by GWAS can only explain a small proportion of the 
      heritability of complex diseases. A large fraction of genetic variants is still 
      hidden. Association analysis has limited power to unravel mechanisms of complex 
      diseases. It is time to shift the paradigm of genomic analysis from association 
      analysis to causal inference. Causal inference is an essential component for the 
      discovery of mechanism of diseases. This paper will review the major platforms of 
      the genomic analysis in the past and discuss the perspectives of causal inference 
      as a general framework of genomic analysis. In genomic data analysis, we usually 
      consider four types of associations: association of discrete variables (DNA 
      variation) with continuous variables (phenotypes and gene expressions), 
      association of continuous variables (expressions, methylations, and imaging 
      signals) with continuous variables (gene expressions, imaging signals, 
      phenotypes, and physiological traits), association of discrete variables (DNA 
      variation) with binary trait (disease status) and association of continuous 
      variables (gene expressions, methylations, phenotypes, and imaging signals) with 
      binary trait (disease status). In this paper, we will review algorithmic 
      information theory as a general framework for causal discovery and the recent 
      development of statistical methods for causal inference on discrete data, and 
      discuss the possibility of extending the association analysis of discrete 
      variable with disease to the causal analysis for discrete variable and disease.

TI  - Thyroxin Protects White Matter from Hypoxic-Ischemic Insult in the Immature 
      Sprague⁻Dawley Rat Brain by Regulating Periventricular White Matter and Cortex 
      BDNF and CREB Pathways.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19092573 [doi]
LID - 2573
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periventricular white-matter (WM) injury is a prominent feature of 
      brain injury in preterm infants. Thyroxin (T4) treatment reduces the severity of 
      hypoxic-ischemic (HI)-mediated WM injury in the immature brain. This study aimed 
      to delineate molecular events underlying T4 protection following periventricular 
      WM injury in HI rats. METHODS: Right common-carotid-artery ligation, followed by 
      hypoxia, was performed on seven-day-old rat pups. The HI pups were injected with 
      saline, or 0.2 or 1 mg/kg of T4 at 48⁻96 h postoperatively. Cortex and 
      periventricular WM were dissected for real-time (RT)-quantitative polymerase 
      chain reactions (PCRs), immunoblotting, and for immunofluorescence analysis of 
      neurotrophins, myelin, oligodendrocyte precursors, and neointimal. RESULTS: T4 
      significantly mitigated hypomyelination and oligodendrocyte death in HI pups, 
      whereas angiogenesis of periventricular WM, observed using antiendothelium cell 
      antibody (RECA-1) immunofluorescence and vascular endothelium growth factor 
      (VEGF) immunoblotting, was not affected. T4 also increased the brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factors (BDNFs), but not the nerve growth factor (NGF) expression of 
      injured periventricular WM. However, phosphorylated extracellular signal 
      regulated kinase (p-ERK) and phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
      response element-binding protein (p-CREB) concentrations, but not the BDNF 
      downstream pathway kinases, p38, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (c-JNK), or Akt, 
      were reduced in periventricular WM with T4 treatment. Notably, T4 administration 
      significantly increased BDNF and phosphorylated CREB in the overlying cortex of 
      the HI-induced injured cortex. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that T4 reversed 
      BNDF signaling to attenuate HI-induced WM injury by activating ERK and CREB 
      pathways in the cortex, but not directly in periventricular WM. This study offers 
      molecular insight into the neuroprotective actions of T4 in HI-mediated WM injury 
      in the immature brain.

TI  - Root imaging showing comparisons in root distribution and ontogeny in novel 
      Festulolium populations and closely related perennial ryegrass varieties.

AB  - The incorporation of new sophisticated phenotyping technologies within a crop 
      improvement program allows for a plant breeding strategy that can include 
      selections for major root traits previously inaccessible due to the challenges in 
      their phenotype assessment. High-throughput precision phenotyping technology is 
      employed to evaluate root ontogeny and progressive changes to root architecture 
      of both novel amphiploid and introgression lines of Festulolium over four 
      consecutive months of the growing season and these compared under the same time 
      frame to that of closely related perennial ryegrass (L. perenne) varieties. Root 
      imaging using conventional photography and assembled multiple merged images was 
      used to compare frequencies in root number, their distribution within 0-20 and 
      20-40 cm depths within soil columns, and progressive changes over time. The 
      Festulolium hybrids had more extensive root systems in comparison with 
      L. perenne, and this was especially evident at depth. It was shown that the 
      acquisition of extensive root systems in Festulolium hybrids was not dependent on 
      the presence of an entire Festuca genome. On the contrary, the most pronounced 
      effect on root development within the four Festulolium populations studied was 
      observed in the introgression line Bx509, where a single small genome sequence 
      from F. arundinacea had been previously transferred onto its homoeologous site on 
      the long arm of chromosome 3 of an otherwise complete L. perenne genome. This 
      demonstrates that a targeted introgression-breeding approach may be sufficient to 
      confer a significant improvement in the root morphology in Lolium without a 
      significant compromise to its genome integrity. The forage production of Bx509 
      was either higher (months 1-3) or equivalent to (month 4) that of its L. perenne 
      parent control demonstrating that the enhanced root development achieved by the 
      introgression line was without compromise to its agronomic performance.

AB  - The specific consequences of hyperglycaemia on placental metabolism and function 
      are incompletely understood but likely contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes 
      associated with diabetes mellitus (DM). This study aimed to identify the 
      functional biochemical pathways perturbed by placental exposure to high glucose 
      levels through integrative analysis of the trophoblast transcriptome and 
      metabolome. The human trophoblast cell line, BeWo, was cultured in 5 or 25 mM 
      glucose, as a model of the placenta in DM. Transcriptomic analysis using 
      microarrays, demonstrated 5632 differentially expressed gene transcripts (≥± 1.3 
      fold change (FC)) following exposure to high glucose. These genes were used to 
      generate interactome models of transcript response using BioGRID (non-inferred 
      network: 2500 nodes (genes) and 10541 protein-protein interactions). Ultra 
      performance-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) and gas 
      chromatography-MS analysis of intracellular extracts and culture medium were used 
      to assess the response of metabolite profiles to high glucose concentration. The 
      interactions of altered genes and metabolites were assessed using the MetScape 
      interactome database, resulting in an integrated model of systemic transcriptome 
      (2969 genes) and metabolome (41 metabolites) response within placental cells 
      exposed to high glucose. The functional pathways which demonstrated significant 
      change in response to high glucose included fatty acid β-oxidation, phospholipid 
      metabolism and phosphatidylinositol phosphate signalling.

LID - 10.3390/ijms19071889 [doi]
LID - 1889
AB  - Both fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver are the end results of most kinds of 
      chronic liver damage and represent a common but difficult clinical challenge 
      throughout the world. The inhibition of the fibrogenic, proliferative, and 
      migratory effects of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) has become an experimental 
      therapy for preventing and even reversing hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, a 
      complete understanding of the function of non-coding RNA-mediated epigenetic 
      mechanisms in HSC activation may improve our perception of liver fibrosis 
      pathogenesis. This review focuses on the evolving view of the molecular 
      mechanisms by which HSC activation by miR-29a signaling may moderate the 
      profibrogenic phenotype of these cells, thus supporting the use of miR-29a 
      agonists as a potential therapy for treating liver fibrosis in the future.

AB  - The yeast Lachancea thermotolerans (previously Kluyveromyces thermotolerans) is a 
      species of large, yet underexplored, oenological potential. This study delivers 
      comprehensive oenological phenomes of 94 L. thermotolerans strains obtained from 
      diverse ecological niches worldwide, classified in nine genetic groups based on 
      their pre-determined microsatellite genotypes. The strains and the genetic groups 
      were compared for their alcoholic fermentation performance, production of primary 
      and secondary metabolites and pH modulation in Chardonnay grape juice 
      fermentations. The common oenological features of L. thermotolerans strains were 
      their glucophilic character, relatively extensive fermentation ability, low 
      production of acetic acid and the formation of lactic acid, which significantly 
      affected the pH of the wines. An untargeted analysis of volatile compounds, used 
      for the first time in a population-scale phenotyping of a non-Saccharomyces 
      yeast, revealed that 58 out of 90 volatiles were affected at an L. thermotolerans 
      strain level. Besides the remarkable extent of intra-specific diversity, our 
      results confirmed the distinct phenotypic performance of L. thermotolerans 
      genetic groups. Together, these observations provide further support for the 
      occurrence of domestication events and allopatric differentiation in L. 
      thermotolerans population.

TI  - Molecular phenomics and metagenomics of hepatic steatosis in non-diabetic obese 
      women.
PG  - 1070-1080
LID - 10.1038/s41591-018-0061-3 [doi]
AB  - Hepatic steatosis is a multifactorial condition that is often observed in obese 
      patients and is a prelude to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here, we combine 
      shotgun sequencing of fecal metagenomes with molecular phenomics (hepatic 
      transcriptome and plasma and urine metabolomes) in two well-characterized cohorts 
      of morbidly obese women recruited to the FLORINASH study. We reveal molecular 
      networks linking the gut microbiome and the host phenome to hepatic steatosis. 
      Patients with steatosis have low microbial gene richness and increased genetic 
      potential for the processing of dietary lipids and endotoxin biosynthesis 
      (notably from Proteobacteria), hepatic inflammation and dysregulation of aromatic 
      and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. We demonstrated that fecal microbiota 
      transplants and chronic treatment with phenylacetic acid, a microbial product of 
      aromatic amino acid metabolism, successfully trigger steatosis and branched-chain 
      amino acid metabolism. Molecular phenomic signatures were predictive (area under 
      the curve = 87%) and consistent with the gut microbiome having an effect on the 
      steatosis phenome (>75% shared variation) and, therefore, actionable via 
      microbiome-based therapies.

AB  - Clear evidence supports a dimensional view of psychiatric illness. Within this 
      framework the expression of disorder-relevant phenotypes is often interpreted as 
      a breakdown or departure from normal brain function. Conversely, health is 
      reified, conceptualized as possessing a single ideal state. We challenge this 
      concept here, arguing that there is no universally optimal profile of brain 
      functioning. The evolutionary forces that shape our species select for a 
      staggering diversity of human behaviors. To support our position we highlight 
      pervasive population-level variability within large-scale functional networks and 
      discrete circuits. We propose that, instead of examining behaviors in isolation, 
      psychiatric illnesses can be best understood through the study of domains of 
      functioning and associated multivariate patterns of variation across distributed 
      brain systems.

TI  - Reduced Arogenate Dehydratase Expression: Ramifications for Photosynthesis and 
      Metabolism.
PG  - 115-131
LID - 10.1104/pp.17.01766 [doi]
AB  - Arogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the final step of phenylalanine (Phe) 
      biosynthesis. Previous work showed that ADT-deficient Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis 
      thaliana) mutants had significantly reduced lignin contents, with stronger 
      reductions in lines that had deficiencies in more ADT isoforms. Here, by 
      analyzing Arabidopsis ADT mutants using our phenomics facility and 
      ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we 
      describe the effects of the modulation of ADT on photosynthetic parameters and 
      secondary metabolism. Our data indicate that a reduced carbon flux into Phe 
      biosynthesis in ADT mutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically 
      produced ATP, leading to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, the overaccumulation of 
      transitory starch, and lower electron transport rates. The effect on electron 
      transport rates is caused by an increase in proton motive force across the 
      thylakoid membrane that down-regulates photosystem II activity by the high-energy 
      quenching mechanism. Furthermore, quantitation of secondary metabolites in ADT 
      mutants revealed reduced flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, lignan, and glucosinolate 
      contents, including glucosinolates that are not derived from aromatic amino 
      acids, and significantly increased contents of putative galactolipids and 
      apocarotenoids. Additionally, we used real-time atmospheric monitoring mass 
      spectrometry to compare respiration and carbon fixation rates between the wild 
      type and adt3/4/5/6, our most extreme ADT knockout mutant, which revealed no 
      significant difference in both night- and day-adapted plants. Overall, these data 
      reveal the profound effects of altered ADT activity and Phe metabolism on 
      secondary metabolites and photosynthesis with implications for plant improvement.

TI  - Proactive control as a double-edged sword in autism spectrum disorder.
PG  - 429-435
LID - 10.1037/abn0000345 [doi]
AB  - Proactive control refers to the active representation of contextual information 
      to bias cognitive processing and facilitate goal-directed behavior. Despite 
      research suggesting that proactive control may be impaired in autism spectrum 
      disorder (ASD), the associations between proactive control and clinical symptoms 
      of ASD remain underspecified. Here, we combined a children's version of the AX 
      Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT) with gold standard clinical assessments in 
      children with ASD (N = 34) or typical development (TYP; N = 45). After 
      controlling for full-scale IQ (FSIQ), measures of proactive control were similar 
      between ASD and TYP. However, specifically within ASD we observed paradoxical 
      relationships between proactive control and clinical symptoms. Increased reliance 
      on proactive control was associated with reduced attention problems and increased 
      restricted and repetitive behaviors in ASD. Therefore, proactive control appears 
      to represent a double-edged sword in ASD: improved attentional control at the 
      cost of heightened behavioral inflexibility. This represents a compelling and new 
      characterization of the specific association between cognitive control processes 
      isolated in computerized laboratory tasks and the multidimensional cognitive 
      symptoms characteristic of ASD. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Depressive symptomatology in school-aged children with obstructive sleep apnea 
      syndrome: incidence, demographic factors, and changes following a randomized 
      controlled trial of adenotonsillectomy.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsy180 [doi]
LID - zsy180
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Depressive symptoms following adenotonsillectomy (AT) relative 
      to controls were examined in children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
      (OSAS). METHODS: The Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT) multisite study 
      examined the impact of AT in 453 children aged 5 to 9.9 years with 
      polysomnographic evidence of OSAS without prolonged desaturation, randomized to 
      early adenotonsillectomy (eAT) or watchful waiting with supportive care (WWSC). 
      One hundred seventy-six children (eAT n = 83; WWSC n = 93) with complete 
      evaluations for depressive symptomatology between baseline and after a 7-month 
      intervention period were included in this secondary analysis. RESULTS: Exact 
      binomial test assessed proportion of depressive symptomatology relative to norms, 
      while effects of AT and OSAS resolution were assessed through linear quantile 
      mixed-models. Treatment group assignment did not significantly impact depression 
      symptoms, although self-reported depression symptoms improved over time (p < 
      0.001). Resolution of OSAS symptoms demonstrated a small interaction effect in an 
      unexpected direction, with more improvement in parent ratings of 
      anxious/depressed symptoms for children without resolution (p = 0.030). Black 
      children reported more severe depressive symptoms (p = 0.026) and parents of 
      overweight/obese children reported more withdrawn/depressed symptoms (p = 0.004). 
      Desaturation nadir during sleep was associated with self-report depressed (r = 
      -0.17, p = 0.028), parent-reported anxious/depressed (r = -0.15, p = 0.049), and 
      withdrawn/depressed (r = -0.24, p = 0.002) symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Increased risk 
      for depressed and withdrawn/depressed symptoms was detected among children with 
      OSAS, and different demographic variables contributed to risk in self-reported 
      and parent-reported depression symptoms. Arterial oxygen desaturation nadir 
      during sleep was strongly associated with depressed symptoms. However, despite 
      improvements in child-reported depressed symptoms over time, changes were 
      unrelated to either treatment group or OSAS resolution status. TRIALS

TI  - Sarcoidosis Related Novel Candidate Genes Identified by Multi-Omics Integrative 
      Analyses.
PG  - 322-331
LID - 10.1089/omi.2018.0027 [doi]
AB  - Sarcoidosis is a multifactorial systemic disease characterized by granulomatous 
      inflammation and greatly impacting on global public health. The etiology and 
      mechanisms of sarcoidosis are not fully understood. Recent high-throughput 
      biological research has generated vast amounts of multi-omics big data on 
      sarcoidosis, but their significance remains to be determined. We sought to 
      identify novel candidate regions, and genes consistently altered in heterogeneous 
      omics studies so as to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. We conducted a 
      comprehensive integrative literature analysis on global data on sarcoidosis, 
      including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and phenomic studies. We performed 
      positional integration analysis of 38 eligible datasets originating from 17 
      different biological layers. Using the integration interval length of 50 kb, we 
      identified 54 regions reaching significance value p ≤ 0.0001 and 15 regions with 
      significance value p ≤ 0.00001, when applying more stringent criteria. Secondary 
      literature analysis of the top 20 regions, with the most significant accumulation 
      of signals, revealed several novel candidate genes for which associations with 
      sarcoidosis have not yet been established, but have considerable support for 
      their involvement based on omic data. These new plausible candidate genes include 
      NELFE, CFB, EGFL7, AGPAT2, FKBPL, NRC3, and NEU1. Furthermore, annotated data 
      were prepared to enable custom visualization and browsing of these sarcoidosis 
      related omics evidence in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome 
      Browser. Further multi-omics approaches are called for sarcoidosis biomarkers and 
      diagnostic and therapeutic innovation. Our approach for harnessing multi-omics 
      data and the findings presented herein reflect important steps toward 
      understanding the etiology and underlying pathological mechanisms of sarcoidosis.

TI  - Uneven Distribution of Mutational Variance Across the Transcriptome of Drosophila 
      serrata Revealed by High-Dimensional Analysis of Gene Expression.
PG  - 1319-1328
LID - 10.1534/genetics.118.300757 [doi]
AB  - There are essentially an infinite number of traits that could be measured on any 
      organism, and almost all individual traits display genetic variation, yet 
      substantial genetic variance in a large number of independent traits is not 
      plausible under basic models of selection and mutation. One mechanism that may be 
      invoked to explain the observed levels of genetic variance in individual traits 
      is that pleiotropy results in fewer dimensions of phenotypic space with 
      substantial genetic variance. Multivariate genetic analyses of small sets of 
      functionally related traits have shown that standing genetic variance is often 
      concentrated in relatively few dimensions. It is unknown if a similar 
      concentration of genetic variance occurs at a phenome-wide scale when many traits 
      of disparate function are considered, or if the genetic variance generated by new 
      mutations is also unevenly distributed across phenotypic space. Here, we used a 
      Bayesian sparse factor model to characterize the distribution of mutational 
      variance of 3385 gene expression traits of Drosophila serrata after 27 
      generations of mutation accumulation, and found that 46% of the estimated 
      mutational variance was concentrated in just 21 dimensions with significant 
      mutational heritability. We show that the extent of concentration of mutational 
      variance into such a small subspace has the potential to substantially bias the 
      response to selection of these traits.

TI  - Genotypic and Environmental Effects on the Volatile Chemotype of Valeriana

AB  - Valeriana jatamansi Jones is an aromatic medicinal herb and important alternative 
      to V. officinalis, which is utilized for medicinal purposes in China and India 
      and also as spices in India. Bioactive ingredients of V. jatamansi vary in 
      different regions. However, no information is currently available on influence of 
      genotype and environmental factors in the volatile compounds, especially when 
      germplasms and planting locations need to be selected. Based on the results of 
      SNP and volatile constituents from GC-MS analysis, this study found various 
      genotypes and chemotypes of V. jatamansi for wild plants from seven regions in 
      China and common-garden samples; correlations between genotype and chemotype were 
      revealed for the plants. Two distinct populations (PX, FY) were distinguishable 
      from five others (GJ, YL, SY, DD, DY) according to their genotypes and volatile 
      profiles, the consistency of which was observed showing that genotype could 
      significantly influence chemotype. Wild populations and common-garden samples 
      were also separated in their volatile profiles, demonstrating that environmental 
      factors strongly affected their chemotypes. Compounds contributing to the 
      discrimination were identified as discriminatory compounds. This investigation 
      has explored and provided essential information concerning the correlation 
      between genotype and chemotype as well as environmental factors and chemotype of 
      V. jatamansi in some regions of China. Feasible plantation and conservation 
      strategies of V. jatamansi could be further explored based on these results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite numerous mobile health (mHealth) applications available, 
      current impact on mental healthcare is low. Users face overwhelming variety of 
      applications and sensors. Evidence for distinct features' effectiveness is 
      largely lacking. Along with technical feasibility and data security issues, 
      readiness and preferences of patients predetermine engagement and impact of 
      mHealth in psychiatry. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the prospective attitudes of 
      psychiatric patients and mental health professionals (MHP) towards mHealth 
      applications in general and with regard to distinct features. METHODS: We 
      conducted a survey entailing 486 subjects (297 MHP and 189 patients). RESULTS: 
      Professionals and patients indicate both, considerable acceptance and rejection 
      for most features. Marked concerns across groups relate to data security in 
      general. Actimetry and geotracking were considered particularly skeptical. 
      Importantly, most patients prefer to be prompted timely about health status 
      changes. CONCLUSION: Altogether, evidence indicates substantial support for 
      mHealth features in mental healthcare despite considerable rejection of distinct 
      features. We conclude that tighter collaboration between researchers, developers 
      and clinicians must address matching mHealth-apps to patients' needs. Improved 
      information on potential risks and possibilities associated with mHealth features 
      is strongly indicated in MHP and psychiatric patients in order to reach an 
      appropriately informed decision on individual involvement.

TI  - The MR-Base platform supports systematic causal inference across the human 
      phenome.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.34408 [doi]
LID - e34408
AB  - Results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can be used to infer causal 
      relationships between phenotypes, using a strategy known as 2-sample Mendelian 
      randomization (2SMR) and bypassing the need for individual-level data. However, 
      2SMR methods are evolving rapidly and GWAS results are often insufficiently 
      curated, undermining efficient implementation of the approach. We therefore 
      developed MR-Base (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" 
      xlink:href="http://www.mrbase.org">http://www.mrbase.org</ext-link>): a platform 
      that integrates a curated database of complete GWAS results (no restrictions 
      according to statistical significance) with an application programming interface, 
      web app and R packages that automate 2SMR. The software includes several 
      sensitivity analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other 
      violations of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single 
      nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations from 1673 GWAS and is updated on a 
      regular basis. Integrating data with software ensures more rigorous application 
      of hypothesis-driven analyses and allows millions of potential causal 
      relationships to be efficiently evaluated in phenome-wide association studies.

TI  - Evaluating the potential role of pleiotropy in Mendelian randomization studies.
PG  - R195-R208
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddy163 [doi]
AB  - Pleiotropy, the phenomenon of a single genetic variant influencing multiple 
      traits, is likely widespread in the human genome. If pleiotropy arises because 
      the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) influences one trait, which in turn 
      influences another ('vertical pleiotropy'), then Mendelian randomization (MR) can 
      be used to estimate the causal influence between the traits. Of prime focus among 
      the many limitations to MR is the unprovable assumption that apparent pleiotropic 
      associations are mediated by the exposure (i.e. reflect vertical pleiotropy), and 
      do not arise due to SNPs influencing the two traits through independent pathways 
      ('horizontal pleiotropy'). The burgeoning treasure trove of genetic associations 
      yielded through genome wide association studies makes for a tantalizing prospect 
      of phenome-wide causal inference. Recent years have seen substantial attention 
      devoted to the problem of horizontal pleiotropy, and in this review we outline 
      how newly developed methods can be used together to improve the reliability of 
      MR.

TI  - De novo and inherited private variants in MAP1B in periventricular nodular 
      heterotopia.
PG  - e1007281
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1007281 [doi]
LID - e1007281
AB  - Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) is a malformation of cortical 
      development commonly associated with epilepsy. We exome sequenced 202 individuals 
      with sporadic PVNH to identify novel genetic risk loci. We first performed a 
      trio-based analysis and identified 219 de novo variants. Although no novel genes 
      were implicated in this initial analysis, PVNH cases were found overall to have a 
      significant excess of nonsynonymous de novo variants in intolerant genes (p = 
      3.27x10-7), suggesting a role for rare new alleles in genes yet to be associated 
      with the condition. Using a gene-level collapsing analysis comparing cases and 
      controls, we identified a genome-wide significant signal driven by four 
      ultra-rare loss-of-function heterozygous variants in MAP1B, including one de novo 
      variant. In at least one instance, the MAP1B variant was inherited from a parent 
      with previously undiagnosed PVNH. The PVNH was frontally predominant and 
      associated with perisylvian polymicrogyria. These results implicate MAP1B in 
      PVNH. More broadly, our findings suggest that detrimental mutations likely 
      arising in immediately preceding generations with incomplete penetrance may also 
      be responsible for some apparently sporadic diseases.

AB  - The field of human genomics has changed dramatically over time. Initial genomic 
      studies were predominantly restricted to rare disorders in small families. Over 
      the past decade, researchers changed course from family-based studies and instead 
      focused on common diseases and traits in populations of unrelated individuals. 
      With further advancements in biobanking, computer science, electronic health 
      record (EHR) data, and more affordable high-throughput genomics, we are 
      experiencing a new paradigm in human genomic research. Rapidly changing 
      technologies and resources now make it possible to study thousands of diseases 
      simultaneously at the genomic level. This review will focus on these advancements 
      as scientists begin to incorporate phenome-wide strategies in human genomic 
      research to understand the etiology of human diseases and develop new drugs to 
      treat them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A serious adverse effect of corticosteroid therapy is adrenal 
      suppression. Our aim was to identify genetic variants affecting susceptibility to 
      corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression. METHODS: We enrolled children with 
      asthma who used inhaled corticosteroids as part of their treatment from 25 sites 
      across the UK (discovery cohort), as part of the Pharmacogenetics of Adrenal 
      Suppression with Inhaled Steroids (PASS) study. We included two validation 
      cohorts, one comprising children with asthma (PASS study) and the other 
      consisting of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) who were 
      recruited from two UK centres for the Pharmacogenomics of Adrenal Suppression in 
      COPD (PASIC) study. Participants underwent a low-dose short synacthen test. 
      Adrenal suppression was defined as peak cortisol less than 350 nmol/L (in 
      children) and less than 500 nmol/L (in adults). A case-control genome-wide 
      association study was done with the control subset augmented by Wellcome Trust 
      Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) participants. Single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs) that fulfilled criteria to be advanced to replication were tested by a 
      random-effects inverse variance meta-analysis. This report presents the primary 
      analysis. The PASS study is registered in the European Genome-phenome Archive 
      (EGA). The PASS study is complete whereas the PASIC study is ongoing. FINDINGS: 
      Between November, 2008, and September, 2011, 499 children were enrolled to the 
      discovery cohort. Between October, 2011, and December, 2012, 81 children were 
      enrolled to the paediatric validation cohort, and from February, 2010, to June, 
      2015, 78 adults were enrolled to the adult validation cohort. Adrenal suppression 
      was present in 35 (7%) children in the discovery cohort and six (7%) children and 
      17 (22%) adults in the validation cohorts. In the discovery cohort, 40 SNPs were 
      found to be associated with adrenal suppression (genome-wide significance 
      p<1 × 10(-6)), including an intronic SNP within the PDGFD gene locus (rs591118; 
      odds ratio [OR] 7·32, 95% CI 3·15-16·99; p=5·8 × 10(-8)). This finding for 
      rs591118 was validated successfully in both the paediatric asthma (OR 3·86, 95% 
      CI 1·19-12·50; p=0·02) and adult COPD (2·41, 1·10-5·28; p=0·03) cohorts. The 
      proportions of patients with adrenal suppression by rs591118 genotype were six 
      (3%) of 214 patients with the GG genotype, 15 (6%) of 244 with the AG genotype, 
      and 22 (25%) of 87 with the AA genotype. Meta-analysis of the paediatric cohorts 
      (discovery and validation) and all three cohorts showed genome-wide significance 
      of rs591118 (respectively, OR 5·89, 95% CI 2·97-11·68; p=4·3 × 10(-9); and 4·05, 
      2·00-8·21; p=3·5 × 10(-10)). INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that genetic 
      variation in the PDGFD gene locus increases the risk of adrenal suppression in 
      children and adults who use corticosteroids to treat asthma and COPD, 
      respectively. FUNDING: Department of Health Chair in Pharmacogenetics.

AB  - The Functional Annotation of ANimal Genomes (FAANG) project aims, through a 
      coordinated international effort, to provide high quality functional annotation 
      of animal genomes with an initial focus on farmed and companion animals. A key 
      goal of the initiative is to ensure high quality and rich supporting metadata to 
      describe the project's animals, specimens, cell cultures and experimental assays. 
      By defining rich sample and experimental metadata standards and promoting best 
      practices in data descriptions, deposition and openness, FAANG champions higher 
      quality and reusability of published datasets. FAANG has established a Data 
      Coordination Centre, which sits at the heart of the Metadata and Data Sharing 
      Committee. It continues to evolve the metadata standards, support submissions 
      and, crucially, create powerful and accessible tools to support deposition and 
      validation of metadata. FAANG conforms to the findable, accessible, 
      interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principles, with high quality, open 
      access and functionally interlinked data. In addition to data generated by FAANG 
      members and specific FAANG projects, existing datasets that meet the main-or more 
      permissive legacy-standards are incorporated into a central, focused, functional 
      data resource portal for the entire farmed and companion animal community. 
      Through clear and effective metadata standards, validation and conversion 
      software, combined with promotion of best practices in metadata implementation, 
      FAANG aims to maximise effectiveness and inter-comparability of assay data. This 
      supports the community to create a rich genome-to-phenotype resource and promotes 
      continuing improvements in animal data standards as a whole.

TI  - Tissue Phenomics for prognostic biomarker discovery in low- and intermediate-risk 
      prostate cancer.
PG  - 4470
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-22564-7 [doi]
LID - 4470
AB  - Tissue Phenomics is the discipline of mining tissue images to identify patterns 
      that are related to clinical outcome providing potential prognostic and 
      predictive value. This involves the discovery process from assay development, 
      image analysis, and data mining to the final interpretation and validation of the 
      findings. Importantly, this process is not linear but allows backward steps and 
      optimization loops over multiple sub-processes. We provide a detailed description 
      of the Tissue Phenomics methodology while exemplifying each step on the 
      application of prostate cancer recurrence prediction. In particular, we 
      automatically identified tissue-based biomarkers having significant prognostic 
      value for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients (Gleason scores 
      6-7b) after radical prostatectomy. We found that promising phenes were related to 
      CD8(+) and CD68(+) cells in the microenvironment of cancerous glands in 
      combination with the local micro-vascularization. Recurrence prediction based on 
      the selected phenes yielded accuracies up to 83% thereby clearly outperforming 
      prediction based on the Gleason score. Moreover, we compared different machine 
      learning algorithms to combine the most relevant phenes resulting in increased 
      accuracies of 88% for tumor progression prediction. These findings will be of 
      potential use for future prognostic tests for prostate cancer patients and 
      provide a proof-of-principle of the Tissue Phenomics approach.

TI  - Reduced plasma levels of small HDL particles transporting fibrinolytic proteins 
      in pulmonary arterial hypertension.
PG  - 380-389
LID - 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2018-212144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aberrant lipoprotein metabolism has been implicated in experimental 
      pulmonary hypertension, but the relevance to patients with pulmonary arterial 
      hypertension (PAH) is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship 
      between circulating lipoprotein subclasses and survival in patients with PAH. 
      METHODS: Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 105 discrete lipoproteins 
      were measured in plasma samples from two cohorts of patients with idiopathic or 
      heritable PAH. Data from 1124 plasma proteins were used to identify proteins 
      linked to lipoprotein subclasses. The physical presence of proteins was confirmed 
      in plasma lipoprotein subfractions separated by ultracentrifugation. RESULTS: 
      Plasma levels of three lipoproteins from the small high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
      subclass, termed HDL-4, were inversely related to survival in both the discovery 
      (n=127) and validation (n=77) cohorts, independent of exercise capacity, 
      comorbidities, treatment, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide, C reactive 
      protein and the principal lipoprotein classes. The small HDL subclass rich in 
      apolipoprotein A-2 content (HDL-4-Apo A-2) exhibited the most significant 
      association with survival. None of the other lipoprotein classes, including 
      principal lipoprotein classes HDL and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, were 
      prognostic. Three out of nine proteins identified to associate with HDL-4-Apo A-2 
      are involved in the regulation of fibrinolysis, namely, the plasmin regulator, 
      alpha-2-antiplasmin, and two major components of the kallikrein-kinin pathway 
      (coagulation factor XI and prekallikrein), and their physical presence in the 
      HDL-4 subfraction was confirmed. CONCLUSION: Reduced plasma levels of small HDL 
      particles transporting fibrinolytic proteins are associated with poor outcomes in 
      patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH.

AB  - MOTIVATION: In the era of big data and precision medicine, the number of 
      databases containing clinical, environmental, self-reported and biochemical 
      variables is increasing exponentially. Enabling the experts to focus on their 
      research questions rather than on computational data management, access and 
      analysis is one of the most significant challenges nowadays. RESULTS: We present 
      Rcupcake, an R package that contains a variety of functions for leveraging 
      different databases through the BD2K PIC-SURE RESTful API and facilitating its 
      query, analysis and interpretation. The package offers a variety of analysis and 
      visualization tools, including the study of the phenotype co-occurrence and 
      prevalence, according to multiple layers of data, such as phenome, exposome or 
      genome. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The package is implemented in R and is 
      available under Mozilla v2 license from GitHub 
      (https://github.com/hms-dbmi/Rcupcake). Two reproducible case studies are also 
      available 
      (https://github.com/hms-dbmi/Rcupcake-case-studies/blob/master/SSCcaseStudy_v01.ipynb,

TI  - Changes in lipid metabolism convey acid tolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 297
LID - 10.1186/s13068-018-1295-5 [doi]
LID - 297
AB  - BACKGROUND: The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae plays an essential role in the 
      fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Weak organic acids in 
      lignocellulosic hydrolysate can hamper the use of this renewable resource for 
      fuel and chemical production. Plasma-membrane remodeling has recently been found 
      to be involved in acquiring tolerance to organic acids, but the mechanisms 
      responsible remain largely unknown. Therefore, it is essential to understand the 
      underlying mechanisms of acid tolerance of S. cerevisiae for developing robust 
      industrial strains. RESULTS: We have performed a comparative analysis of lipids 
      and fatty acids in S. cerevisiae grown in the presence of four different weak 
      acids. The general response of the yeast to acid stress was found to be the 
      accumulation of triacylglycerols and the degradation of steryl esters. In 
      addition, a decrease in phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylcholine, 
      phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, and an increase in 
      phosphatidylinositol were observed. Loss of cardiolipin in the mitochondria 
      membrane may be responsible for the dysfunction of mitochondria and the dramatic 
      decrease in the rate of respiration of S. cerevisiae under acid stress. 
      Interestingly, the accumulation of ergosterol was found to be a protective 
      mechanism of yeast exposed to organic acids, and the ERG1 gene in ergosterol 
      biosynthesis played a key in ergosterol-mediated acid tolerance, as perturbing 
      the expression of this gene caused rapid loss of viability. Interestingly, 
      overexpressing OLE1 resulted in the increased levels of oleic acid (18:1n-9) and 
      an increase in the unsaturation index of fatty acids in the plasma membrane, 
      resulting in higher tolerance to acetic, formic and levulinic acid, while this 
      change was found to be detrimental to cells exposed to lipophilic cinnamic acid. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of lipid profiles revealed different remodeling of 
      lipids, FAs and the unsaturation index of the FAs in the cell membrane in 
      response of S. cerevisiae to acetic, formic, levulinic and cinnamic acid, 
      depending on the properties of the acid. In future work, it will be necessary to 
      combine lipidome and transcriptome analysis to gain a better understanding of the 
      underlying regulation network and interactions between central carbon metabolism 
      (e.g., glycolysis, TCA cycle) and lipid biosynthesis.

TI  - Aerial Imagery Analysis - Quantifying Appearance and Number of Sorghum Heads for 
      Applications in Breeding and Agronomy.
PG  - 1544

AB  - Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is a C4 tropical grass that plays an 
      essential role in providing nutrition to humans and livestock, particularly in 
      marginal rainfall environments. The timing of head development and the number of 
      heads per unit area are key adaptation traits to consider in agronomy and 
      breeding but are time consuming and labor intensive to measure. We propose a 
      two-step machine-based image processing method to detect and count the number of 
      heads from high-resolution images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in 
      a breeding trial. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, 52 
      images were manually labeled; the precision and recall of head detection were 
      0.87 and 0.98, respectively, and the coefficient of determination (R (2)) between 
      the manual and new methods of counting was 0.84. To verify the utility of the 
      method in breeding programs, a geolocation-based plot segmentation method was 
      applied to pre-processed ortho-mosaic images to extract >1000 plots from original 
      RGB images. Forty of these plots were randomly selected and labeled manually; the 
      precision and recall of detection were 0.82 and 0.98, respectively, and the 
      coefficient of determination between manual and algorithm counting was 0.56, with 
      the major source of error being related to the morphology of plants resulting in 
      heads being displayed both within and outside the plot in which the plants were 
      sown, i.e., being allocated to a neighboring plot. Finally, the potential 
      applications in yield estimation from UAV-based imagery from agronomy experiments 
      and scouting of production fields are also discussed.

TI  - An update on the taxonomy of the genus Frankia Brunchorst, 1886, 174(AL).
PG  - 5-21
LID - 10.1007/s10482-018-1165-y [doi]
AB  - Since the recognition of the name Frankia in the Approved Lists of bacterial 
      names (1980), few amendments have been given to the genus description. Successive 
      editions of Bergey's Manual of Systematics of Archaea and Bacteria have broadly 
      conflicting suprageneric treatments of the genus without any advances for 
      subgeneric classification. This review focuses on recent results from 
      taxongenomics and phenoarray approaches to the positioning and the structuring of 
      the genus Frankia. Based on phylogenomic analyses, Frankia should be considered 
      the single member of the family Frankiaceae within the monophyletic order, 
      Frankiales. A polyphasic strategy incorporating genome to genome data and 
      omniLog(®) phenoarrays, together with classical approaches, has allowed the 
      designation and an amended description of a type strain of the type species 
      Frankia alni, and the recognition of at least 10 novel species covering symbiotic 
      and non symbiotic taxa within the genus. Genome to phenome data will be shortly 
      incorporated in the scheme for proposing novel species including those 
      recalcitrant to isolation in axenic culture.

TI  - Integration of multi-omics techniques and physiological phenotyping within a 
      holistic phenomics approach to study senescence in model and crop plants.
PG  - 825-844
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erx333 [doi]
AB  - The study of senescence in plants is complicated by diverse levels of temporal 
      and spatial dynamics as well as the impact of external biotic and abiotic factors 
      and crop plant management. Whereas the molecular mechanisms involved in 
      developmentally regulated leaf senescence are very well understood, in particular 
      in the annual model plant species Arabidopsis, senescence of other organs such as 
      the flower, fruit, and root is much less studied as well as senescence in 
      perennials such as trees. This review addresses the need for the integration of 
      multi-omics techniques and physiological phenotyping into holistic phenomics 
      approaches to dissect the complex phenomenon of senescence. That became feasible 
      through major advances in the establishment of various, complementary 'omics' 
      technologies. Such an interdisciplinary approach will also need to consider 
      knowledge from the animal field, in particular in relation to novel regulators 
      such as small, non-coding RNAs, epigenetic control and telomere length. Such a 
      characterization of phenotypes via the acquisition of high-dimensional datasets 
      within a systems biology approach will allow us to systematically characterize 
      the various programmes governing senescence beyond leaf senescence in Arabidopsis 
      and to elucidate the underlying molecular processes. Such a multi-omics approach 
      is expected to also spur the application of results from model plants to 
      agriculture and their verification for sustainable and environmentally friendly 
      improvement of crop plant stress resilience and productivity and contribute to 
      improvements based on postharvest physiology for the food industry and the 
      benefit of its customers.

TI  - Racial/Ethnic Disparities in US Pediatric Growth Hormone Treatment.
PG  - 102-108
LID - 10.1159/000491793 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To compare racial/ethnic proportions of subjects receiving 
      growth hormone (GH) treatment to the expected proportions, and secondarily, to 
      assess racial/ethnic differences in subject characteristics at GH treatment 
      initiation. METHODS: Race/ethnicity-based expected frequencies of height <-2.25 
      SD were determined by applying relative risks for short stature, calculated from 
      a regional population of 189,280 pediatric primary care patients, to US census 
      data, and compared to racial/ethnic proportions of US subjects enrolled in the 
      Pfizer International Growth Study (KIGS) using the χ2 test. Characteristics of 
      white and black subjects at GH treatment initiation were presented as medians and 
      compared by the Wilcoxon rank sum test (significant p < 0.01). RESULTS: White 
      subjects exceeded the expected frequency (63%) for all indications (83%) and each 
      separately, ranging from 73% for congenital GH deficiency (GHD) to 85% for 
      idiopathic short stature (p < 0.001). Compared to white subjects, black subjects 
      treated for idiopathic GHD had greater height deficits relative both to the 
      population (-2.97 vs. -2.56 SD) and to their mid-parental heights (-2.47 vs. 
      -1.89 SD), lower stimulated GH peak levels (4.9 vs. 6.0 ng/mL), and lower birth 
      weights (-0.86 vs. -0.48 SD). Black subjects with congenital GHD had lower 
      stimulated GH peaks (2.1 vs. 3.2 ng/mL) and started GH treatment at younger ages 
      (2.9 vs. 4.8 years), while those with acquired GHD had lower birth weights (-1.12 
      vs. -0.08 SD). Male predominance did not differ by race for any or all 
      indications. CONCLUSION: Overrepresentation of white children among those 
      receiving GH treatment in the US KIGS registry reflects racial/ethnic treatment 
      biases, not just differences in growth rates.

AB  - A UPLC-MS/MS assay, employing a reversed-phase separation, has been applied to 
      the analysis of a number of common amino acids and biogenic amines in rat urine. 
      Analytes were derivatised, using 6‑aminoquinolyl‑N‑hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate 
      (AccQTag Ultra™()). Derivatisation with this reagent, by increasing the 
      hydrophobicity of the analytes, enables better retention by improving 
      reversed-phase chromatographic properties and also improves ionisation efficiency 
      to enhance MS-detection. The method allows for the determination of 38 amino 
      compounds in 7.5 min, including baseline resolution of critical isomers. The 
      assay has been validated for the absolute quantification of 29 amino compounds in 
      rat urine, over a concentration range of 0.6-200 μM, for the purpose of 
      exploratory metabolite phenotyping. Acceptable linearity (R(2) > 0.995) and 
      intra- and inter-day accuracy (<20.7%) and precision (<20.1%) for these analytes 
      was achieved. The limits of detection ranged from 1.2-12 fmol on column with 
      20 μL of sample. The remaining nine amines examined were not accurately 
      quantified by this method but can be monitored for relative/fold change in 
      biological samples. The use of the method is exemplified by the monitoring of 
      changes in healthy male Sprague-Dawley rat urinary amino acid concentrations over 
      a 7-day period.

TI  - A Trypsin-Sensitive Proteoglycan from the Tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta Inhibits 
      Murine Neutrophil Chemotaxis in vitro by Suppressing p38 MAP Kinase Activation.
PG  - 136-149
LID - 10.1159/000492303 [doi]
AB  - It has emerged that neutrophils can play important roles in the host response 
      following infection with helminth parasites. Mice infected with the tapeworm, 
      Hymenolepis diminuta, are protected from some inflammatory conditions, 
      accompanied by reduced neutrophil tissue infiltration. Thus, the ability of a 
      phosphate-buffered saline-soluble extract of the worm (H. diminuta extract [HdE]) 
      was tested for (1) its ability to activate murine neutrophils (Ca2+ mobilization, 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokine production); and (2) affect neutrophil 
      chemotaxis in vitro to the penta-peptide, WKYMVm, the chemokine, KC, and 
      leukotriene B4. HdE was not cytotoxic to neutrophils, elicited a Ca2+ response 
      and ROS, but not, cytokine (KC, interleukin-10, tumour necrosis factor-α) 
      generation. HdE is not a chemotactic stimulus for murine neutrophils. However, a 
      heat- and trypsin-sensitive, acid-insensitive proteoglycan (sensitive to sodium 
      metaperiodate) in the HdE significantly reduced neutrophil chemotaxis towards 
      WKYMVm or KC, but not LTB4. The latter suggested that the HdE interfered with p38 
      mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling, which is important in WKYMVm 
      chemotaxis. Corroborating this, immunoblotting revealed reduced phosphorylated 
      p38, and the downstream signal heat-shock protein-27, in protein extracts from 
      HdE + WkYMVm treated cells compared to those exposed to the penta-peptide only. 
      We speculate that HdE can be used to modify the outcome of neutrophilic disease 
      and that purification of the bioactive proteoglycan(s) from the extract could be 
      used as a template to design immunomodulatory drugs targeting neutrophils.

TI  - Identification of novel high-impact recessively inherited type 2 diabetes risk 
      variants in the Greenlandic population.
PG  - 2005-2015

AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: In a recent study using a standard additive genetic model, we 
      identified a TBC1D4 loss-of-function variant with a large recessive impact on 
      risk of type 2 diabetes in Greenlanders. The aim of the current study was to 
      identify additional genetic variation underlying type 2 diabetes using a 
      recessive genetic model, thereby increasing the power to detect variants with 
      recessive effects. METHODS: We investigated three cohorts of Greenlanders (B99, 
      n = 1401; IHIT, n = 3115; and BBH, n = 547), which were genotyped using Illumina 
      MetaboChip. Of the 4674 genotyped individuals passing quality control, 4648 had 
      phenotype data available, and type 2 diabetes association analyses were performed 
      for 317 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 2631 participants with normal 
      glucose tolerance. Statistical association analyses were performed using a linear 
      mixed model. RESULTS: Using a recessive genetic model, we identified two novel 
      loci associated with type 2 diabetes in Greenlanders, namely rs870992 in ITGA1 on 
      chromosome 5 (OR 2.79, p = 1.8 × 10(-8)), and rs16993330 upstream of LARGE1 on 
      chromosome 22 (OR 3.52, p = 1.3 × 10(-7)). The LARGE1 variant did not reach the 
      conventional threshold for genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10(-8)) but did 
      withstand a study-wide Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold. Both variants 
      were common in Greenlanders, with minor allele frequencies of 23% and 16%, 
      respectively, and were estimated to have large recessive effects on risk of type 
      2 diabetes in Greenlanders, compared with additively inherited variants 
      previously observed in European populations. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We 
      demonstrate the value of using a recessive genetic model in a historically small 
      and isolated population to identify genetic risk variants. Our findings give new 
      insights into the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes, and further support 
      the existence of high-effect genetic risk factors of potential clinical 
      relevance, particularly in isolated populations. DATA AVAILABILITY: The 
      Greenlandic MetaboChip-genotype data are available at European Genome-Phenome 
      Archive (EGA; https://ega-archive.org/ ) under the accession EGAS00001002641.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) is being ubiquitously incorporated into everyday products 
      such as Internet search, email spam filters, product recommendations, image 
      classification, and speech recognition. New approaches for highly integrated 
      manufacturing and automation such as the Industry 4.0 and the Internet of things 
      are also converging with ML methodologies. Many approaches incorporate complex 
      artificial neural network architectures and are collectively referred to as deep 
      learning (DL) applications. These methods have been shown capable of representing 
      and learning predictable relationships in many diverse forms of data and hold 
      promise for transforming the future of omics research and applications in 
      precision medicine. Omics and electronic health record data pose considerable 
      challenges for DL. This is due to many factors such as low signal to noise, 
      analytical variance, and complex data integration requirements. However, DL 
      models have already been shown capable of both improving the ease of data 
      encoding and predictive model performance over alternative approaches. It may not 
      be surprising that concepts encountered in DL share similarities with those 
      observed in biological message relay systems such as gene, protein, and 
      metabolite networks. This expert review examines the challenges and opportunities 
      for DL at a systems and biological scale for a precision medicine readership.

TI  - Zebrafish type I collagen mutants faithfully recapitulate human type I 
      collagenopathies.
PG  - E8037-E8046
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1722200115 [doi]
AB  - The type I collagenopathies are a group of heterogeneous connective tissue 
      disorders, that are caused by mutations in the genes encoding type I collagen and 
      include specific forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and the Ehlers-Danlos 
      syndrome (EDS). These disorders present with a broad disease spectrum and large 
      clinical variability of which the underlying genetic basis is still poorly 
      understood. In this study, we systematically analyzed skeletal phenotypes in a 
      large set of zebrafish, with diverse mutations in the genes encoding type I 
      collagen, representing different genetic forms of human OI, and a zebrafish model 
      resembling human EDS, which harbors a number of soft connective tissues defects, 
      typical of EDS. Furthermore, we provide insight into how zebrafish and human type 
      I collagen are compositionally and functionally related, which is relevant in the 
      interpretation of human type I collagen-related disease models. Our studies 
      reveal a high degree of intergenotype variability in phenotypic expressivity that 
      closely correlates with associated OI severity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the 
      potential for select mutations to give rise to phenotypic variability, mirroring 
      the clinical variability associated with human disease pathology. Therefore, our 
      work suggests the future potential for zebrafish to aid in identifying unknown 
      genetic modifiers and mechanisms underlying the phenotypic variability in OI and 
      related disorders. This will improve diagnostic strategies and enable the 
      discovery of new targetable pathways for pharmacological intervention.

AB  - In this trans-ethnic multi-omic study, we reinterpret the genetic architecture of 
      blood pressure to identify genes, tissues, phenomes and medication contexts of 
      blood pressure homeostasis. We discovered 208 novel common blood pressure SNPs 
      and 53 rare variants in genome-wide association studies of systolic, diastolic 
      and pulse pressure in up to 776,078 participants from the Million Veteran Program 
      (MVP) and collaborating studies, with analysis of the blood pressure clinical 
      phenome in MVP. Our transcriptome-wide association study detected 4,043 blood 
      pressure associations with genetically predicted gene expression of 840 genes in 
      45 tissues, and mouse renal single-cell RNA sequencing identified upregulated 
      blood pressure genes in kidney tubule cells.

AB  - The diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC) is a subtype of gastric cancer with the 
      worst prognosis and few treatment options. Here we present a dataset from 84 DGC 
      patients, composed of a proteome of 11,340 gene products and mutation information 
      of 274 cancer driver genes covering paired tumor and nearby tissue. DGC can be 
      classified into three subtypes (PX1-3) based on the altered proteome alone. PX1 
      and PX2 exhibit dysregulation in the cell cycle and PX2 features an additional 
      EMT process; PX3 is enriched in immune response proteins, has the worst survival, 
      and is insensitive to chemotherapy. Data analysis revealed four major 
      vulnerabilities in DGC that may be targeted for treatment, and allowed the 
      nomination of potential immunotherapy targets for DGC patients, particularly for 
      those in PX3. This dataset provides a rich resource for information and knowledge 
      mining toward altered signaling pathways in DGC and demonstrates the benefit of 
      proteomic analysis in cancer molecular subtyping.

AB  - The extensive comorbidity of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents 
      leads to clinical heterogeneity, and is an often-overlooked issue in 
      etiopathogenic and treatment studies in developmental psychopathology. In a 
      representative sample (N=8236) of New York City public school students assessed 
      six months after 9/11, latent class analysis was applied to 48 symptoms across 
      seven disorders: posttraumatic stress, agoraphobia, separation anxiety, panic 
      disorder, generalized anxiety (GAD), major depression (MDD) and conduct disorder 
      (CD). Our objective was to identify classes defined by homogenous symptom 
      profiles, and to examine the association between class membership and gender, 
      age, race, different types of exposure to 9/11, and impairment. Eight homogenous 
      comorbidity patterns were identified, including four severe disturbance classes: 
      a multimorbid internalizing class (INT), a class with a high probability of CD, 
      MDD, and GAD symptoms (Distress/EXT), a non-comorbid externalizing class, and a 
      non-comorbid MDD class. Demographic and 9/11-related exposures showed some degree 
      of specificity in their association with severe symptom profiles. Impairment was 
      particularly high in the INT and Distress/EXT classes. A better characterization 
      of phenomic data, that takes comorbidity into account, is essential to understand 
      etiopathogenic processes, and to move psychiatric research forward towards 
      personalized medicine. The high probability of endorsing symptoms of multiple 
      disorders in the INT and Distress/EXT classes supports the use of treatments 
      focusing on multimorbidity. Clinical trials should evaluate the effectiveness of 
      disorder-specific versus transdiagnostic interventions. The association between 
      class membership and demographic and exposure variables suggests that 
      interventions may be improved by considering specific predictors of class 
      membership.

AB  - We aimed to identify and quantify CD117(+) and CD90(+) endogenous cardiac 
      progenitor cells (CPC) in human healthy and diseased hearts. We hypothesize that 
      these cells perform a locally acting, contributing function in overcoming medical 
      conditions of the heart by endogenous means. Human myocardium biopsies were 
      obtained from 23 patients with the following diagnoses: Dilatative cardiomyopathy 
      (DCM), ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), myocarditis, and controls from healthy 
      cardiac patients. High-resolution scanning microscopy of the whole slide enabled 
      a computer-based immunohistochemical quantification of CD117 and CD90. Those 
      signals were evaluated by Definiens Tissue Phenomics® Technology. Co-localization 
      of CD117 and CD90 was determined by analyzing comparable serial sections. 
      CD117(+)/CD90(+) cardiac cells were detected in all biopsies. The highest 
      expression of CD90 was revealed in the myocarditis group. CD117 was significantly 
      higher in all patient groups, compared to healthy specimens ((*)p < 0.05). The 
      highest co-expression was found in the myocarditis group (6.75 ± 3.25 
      CD90(+)CD117(+) cells/mm(2)) followed by ICM (4 ± 1.89 cells/mm(2)), DCM (1.67 ± 
      0.58 cells/mm(2)), and healthy specimens (1 ± 0.43 cells/mm(2)). We conclude that 
      the human heart comprises a fraction of local CD117(+) and CD90(+) cells. We 
      hypothesize that these cells are part of local endogenous progenitor cells due to 
      the co-expression of CD90 and CD117. With novel digital image analysis 
      technologies, a quantification of the CD117 and CD90 signals is available. Our 
      experiments reveal an increase of CD117 and CD90 in patients with myocarditis.

TI  - Effect of a combined brief narrative exposure therapy with case management versus 
      treatment as usual in primary care for patients with traumatic stress sequelae 
      following intensive care medicine: study protocol for a multicenter randomized 
      controlled trial (PICTURE).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic events like critical illness and intensive care are threats 
      to life and bodily integrity and pose a risk factor for posttraumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD). PTSD affects the quality of life and morbidity and may increase 
      health-care costs. Limited access to specialist care results in PTSD patients 
      being treated in primary care settings. Narrative exposure therapy (NET) is based 
      on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and has shown positive effects 
      when delivered by health-care professionals other than psychologists. The primary 
      aims of the PICTURE trial (from "PTSD after ICU survival") are to investigate the 
      effectiveness and applicability of NET adapted for primary care with case 
      management in adults diagnosed with PTSD after intensive care. METHODS/DESIGN: 
      This is an investigator-initiated, multi-center, primary care-based, randomized 
      controlled two-arm parallel group, observer-blinded superiority trial conducted 
      throughout Germany. In total, 340 adult patients with a total score of at least 
      20 points on the posttraumatic diagnostic scale (PDS-5) 3 months after receiving 
      intensive care treatment will be equally randomized to two groups: NET combined 
      with case management and improved treatment as usual (iTAU). All primary care 
      physicians (PCPs) involved will be instructed in the diagnosis and treatment of 
      PTSD according to current German guidelines. PCPs in the iTAU group will deliver 
      usual care during three consultations. In the experimental group, PCPs will 
      additionally be trained to deliver an adapted version of NET (three sessions) 
      supported by phone-based case management by a medical assistant. At 6 and 12 
      months after randomization, structured blinded telephone interviews will assess 
      patient-reported outcomes. The primary composite endpoint is the absolute change 
      from baseline at month 6 in PTSD symptom severity measured by the PDS-5 total 
      score, which also incorporates the death of any study patients. Secondary 
      outcomes cover the domains depression, anxiety, disability, health-related 
      quality-of-life, and cost-effectiveness. The principal analysis is by intention 
      to treat. DISCUSSION: If the superiority of the experimental intervention over 
      usual care can be demonstrated, the combination of brief NET and case management 
      could be a treatment option to relieve PTSD-related symptoms and to improve 
      primary care after intensive care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov,

TI  - Unmodern Synthesis: Developmental Hierarchies and the Origin of Phenotypes.
LID - 10.1002/bies.201600265 [doi]
AB  - The question of whether the modern evolutionary synthesis requires an extension 
      has recently become a topic of discussion, and a source of controversy. We 
      suggest that this debate is, for the most part, not about the modern synthesis at 
      all. Rather, it is about the extent to which genetic mechanisms can be regarded 
      as the primary determinants of phenotypic characters. The modern synthesis has 
      been associated with the idea that phenotypes are the result of gene products, 
      while supporters of the extended synthesis have suggested that environmental 
      factors, along with processes such as epigenetic inheritance, and niche 
      construction play an important role in character formation. We argue that the 
      methodology of the modern evolutionary synthesis has been enormously successful, 
      but does not provide an accurate characterization of the origin of phenotypes. 
      For its part, the extended synthesis has yet to be transformed into a testable 
      theory, and accordingly, has yielded few results. We conclude by suggesting that 
      the origin of phenotypes can only be understood by integrating findings from all 
      levels of the organismal hierarchy. In most cases, parts and processes from a 
      single level fail to accurately explain the presence of a given phenotypic trait.

LID - 10.1016/j.juro.2017.08.005 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We describe age, multiple chronic condition profiles and health system 
      contact in patients with urological cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using 
      Geisinger Health System electronic health records we identified adult primary 
      care patients and a subset with at least 1 urology encounter between 2001 and 
      2015. The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality Chronic Condition Indicator 
      and Clinical Classifications Software tools were applied to ICD-9 codes to 
      identify chronic conditions. Multiple chronic conditions were defined as 2 or 
      more chronic conditions. Patients with urological cancer were identified using 
      ICD-9 codes for prostate, bladder, kidney, testis and penile cancer. Inpatient 
      and outpatient visits in the year prior to the most recent encounter were counted 
      to document health system contact. RESULTS: We identified 357,100 primary care 
      and 33,079 urology patients, of whom 4,023 had urological cancer. Patients with 
      urological cancer were older than primary care patients (71 vs 46 years) and they 
      had more median chronic conditions (7 vs 4). Kidney and bladder cancer were the 
      most common chronic conditions (median 8 patients each). Coronary artery disease 
      and chronic kidney disease were common in urological cancer cases compared to 
      mental health conditions in primary care cases. Patients with urological cancer 
      who had multiple chronic conditions had the most health system contact, including 
      32% with at least 1 hospitalization and 68% with more than 5 outpatient visits 
      during 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Urology patients are older and more medically 
      complex, especially those with urological cancer than primary care patients. 
      These data may inform care redesign to reduce the treatment burden and improve 
      care coordination in urological cancer cases.

TI  - Phenomic and Genomic Characterization of a Mutant Platform in Cucurbita pepo.
PG  - 1049
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2018.01049 [doi]
LID - 1049
AB  - The Cucurbita pepo genome comprises 263 Mb and 34,240 gene models organized in 20 
      different chromosomes. To improve our understanding of gene function we have 
      generated an EMS mutant platform, consisting of 3,751 independent M2 families. 
      The quality of the collection has been evaluated based on phenotyping and 
      whole-genome re-sequencing (WGS) results. The phenotypic evaluation of the whole 
      platform at seedling stage has demonstrated that the rate of variation for easily 
      observable traits is more than 10%. The percentage of families with albino or 
      chlorotic seedlings exceeded 3%, similar or higher to that found in other EMS 
      collections of cucurbit crops. A rapid screening of the library for triple 
      ethylene response in etiolated seedlings allowed the identification of four 
      ethylene-insensitive mutants, that were found to be semidominant (ein1, ein2, and 
      ein3) or dominant (EIN4). By evaluating 4 adult plants from 300 independent 
      families more than 28% of apparent mutations were found for vegetative and 
      reproductive traits, including plant vigor, leaf size and shape, sex expression 
      and sex determination, and fruit set and development. Two pools of genomic DNA 
      derived from 20 plants of two mutant families were subjected to WGS by using NGS 
      methodology, estimating the density, spectrum, distribution and impact of EMS 
      induced mutation. The number of EMS mutations in the genomes of families L1 and 
      L2 was 1,704 and 859, respectively, which represents a density of 11.8 and 6 
      mutations per Mb, respectively. As expected, the predominant EMS induced 
      mutations were C > T and G > A transitions (80.3% in L1, and 61% L2), that were 
      found to be randomly distributed along the 20 chromosomes of C. pepo. The 
      mutations were mostly affecting intergenic regions, but 7.9 and 6% of the 
      identified EMS mutations in L1 and L2, respectively, were located in the exome, 
      and 0.4 and 0.2% had a moderate and high putative impact on gene functions. These 
      results provide information regarding the potential use of the obtained mutant 
      platform in the discovery of novel alleles for both functional genomics and 
      Cucurbita breeding by using direct- or reverse-genetic approaches.

TI  - Development and Assessment of Fully Automated and Globally Transitive Geometric 
      Morphometric Methods, With Application to a Biological Comparative Dataset With 
      High Interspecific Variation.
PG  - 636-658
LID - 10.1002/ar.23700 [doi]
AB  - Automated geometric morphometric methods are promising tools for shape analysis 
      in comparative biology, improving researchers' abilities to quantify variation 
      extensively (by permitting more specimens to be analyzed) and intensively (by 
      characterizing shapes with greater fidelity). Although use of these methods has 
      increased, published automated methods have some notable limitations: pairwise 
      correspondences are frequently inaccurate and pairwise mappings are not globally 
      consistent (i.e., they lack transitivity across the full sample). Here, we 
      reassess the accuracy of published automated methods-cPDist (Boyer et al. Proc 
      Nat Acad Sci 108 () 18221-18226) and auto3Dgm (Boyer et al.: Anat Rec 298 () 
      249-276)-and evaluate several modifications to these methods. We show that a 
      substantial percentage of alignments and pairwise maps between specimens of 
      dissimilar geometries were inaccurate in the study of Boyer et al. (Proc Nat Acad 
      Sci 108 () 18221-18226), despite a taxonomically partitioned variance structure 
      of continuous Procrustes distances. We show these inaccuracies are remedied using 
      a globally informed methodology within a collection of shapes, rather than 
      relying on pairwise comparisons (c.f. Boyer et al.: Anat Rec 298 () 249-276). 
      Unfortunately, while global information generally enhances maps between 
      dissimilar objects, it can degrade the quality of correspondences between similar 
      objects due to the accumulation of numerical error. We explore a number of 
      approaches to mitigate this degradation, quantify their performance, and compare 
      the generated pairwise maps (and the shape space characterized by these maps) to 
      a "ground truth" obtained from landmarks manually collected by geometric 
      morphometricians. Novel methods both improve the quality of the pairwise 
      correspondences relative to cPDist and achieve a taxonomic distinctiveness 
      comparable to auto3Dgm. Anat Rec, 301:636-658, 2018. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals,

AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death 
      worldwide. Dysregulation of protein synthesis plays a major role in 
      carcinogenesis, a process regulated at multiple levels, including translation of 
      mRNA into proteins. Ribosome assembly requires correct association of ribosome 
      subunits, which is ensured by eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs). 
      eIFs have become targets in cancer therapy studies, and promising data on eIF6 in 
      various cancer entities have been reported. Therefore, we hypothesised that eIF6 
      represents a crossroad for pulmonary carcinogenesis. High levels of eIF6 are 
      associated with shorter patient overall survival in adenocarcinoma (ADC), but not 
      in squamous cell carcinoma (SQC) of the lung. We demonstrate significantly higher 
      protein expression of eIF6 in ADC and SQC than in healthy lung tissue based on 
      immunohistochemical data from tissue microarrays (TMAs) and on fresh frozen lung 
      tissue. Depletion of eIF6 in ADC and SQC lung cancer cell lines inhibited cell 
      proliferation and induced apoptosis. Knockdown of eIF6 led to pre-rRNA processing 
      and ribosomal 60S maturation defects. Our data indicate that eIF6 is upregulated 
      in NSCLC, suggesting an important contribution of eIF6 to the development and 
      progression of NSCLC and a potential for new treatment strategies against NSCLC.

AB  - Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and other omics technologies 
      capable to map cell fate provide increasing evidence on the crucial role of 
      intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) for cancer progression. The different facets of 
      ITH, from genomic to microenvironmental heterogeneity and the hierarchical 
      cellular architecture originating from the cancer stem cell compartment, 
      contribute to the range of tumor phenotypes. Decoding these complex data 
      resulting from the analysis of tumor tissue complexity poses a challenge for 
      developing novel therapeutic strategies that can counteract tumor evolution and 
      cellular plasticity. To achieve this aim, the development of in vitro and in vivo 
      cancer models that resemble the complexity of ITH is crucial in understanding the 
      interplay of cells and their (micro)environment and, consequently, in testing the 
      efficacy of new targeted treatments and novel strategies of tailoring 
      combinations of treatments to the individual composition of the tumor. This 
      challenging approach may be an important cornerstone in overcoming the 
      development of pharmaco-resistances during multiple lines of treatment. In this 
      paper, we report the latest advances in patient-derived 3D (PD3D) cell cultures 
      and patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) as in vitro and in vivo models that 
      can retain the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the tumor tissue.

TI  - Multitrait genome association analysis identifies new susceptibility genes for 
      human anthropometric variation in the GCAT cohort.
PG  - 765-778
LID - 10.1136/jmedgenet-2018-105437 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heritability estimates have revealed an important contribution of SNP 
      variants for most common traits; however, SNP analysis by single-trait 
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has failed to uncover their impact. In 
      this study, we applied a multitrait GWAS approach to discover additional factor 
      of the missing heritability of human anthropometric variation. METHODS: We 
      analysed 205 traits, including diseases identified at baseline in the GCAT cohort 
      (Genomes For Life- Cohort study of the Genomes of Catalonia) (n=4988), a 
      Mediterranean adult population-based cohort study from the south of Europe. We 
      estimated SNP heritability contribution and single-trait GWAS for all traits from 
      15 million SNP variants. Then, we applied a multitrait-related approach to study 
      genome-wide association to anthropometric measures in a two-stage meta-analysis 
      with the UK Biobank cohort (n=336 107). RESULTS: Heritability estimates (eg, skin 
      colour, alcohol consumption, smoking habit, body mass index, educational level or 
      height) revealed an important contribution of SNP variants, ranging from 18% to 
      77%. Single-trait analysis identified 1785 SNPs with genome-wide significance 
      threshold. From these, several previously reported single-trait hits were 
      confirmed in our sample with LINC01432 (p=1.9×10(-9)) variants associated with 
      male baldness, LDLR variants with hyperlipidaemia (ICD-9:272) (p=9.4×10(-10)) and 
      variants in IRF4 (p=2.8×10(-57)), SLC45A2 (p=2.2×10(-130)), HERC2 
      (p=2.8×10(-176)), OCA2 (p=2.4×10(-121)) and MC1R (p=7.7×10(-22)) associated with 
      hair, eye and skin colour, freckling, tanning capacity and sun burning 
      sensitivity and the Fitzpatrick phototype score, all highly correlated 
      cross-phenotypes. Multitrait meta-analysis of anthropometric variation validated 
      27 loci in a two-stage meta-analysis with a large British ancestry cohort, six of 
      which are newly reported here (p value threshold <5×10(-9)) at ZRANB2-AS2, 
      PIK3R1, EPHA7, MAD1L1, CACUL1 and MAP3K9. CONCLUSION: Considering 
      multiple-related genetic phenotypes improve associated genome signal detection. 
      These results indicate the potential value of data-driven multivariate 
      phenotyping for genetic studies in large population-based cohorts to contribute 
      to knowledge of complex traits.

AB  - PURPOSE: While endometriosis is recognized to have a high patient burden for 
      adults, the level of morbidity it causes for adolescents has been understudied, 
      and may be minimized by clinicians. The purpose of this study was to determine 
      whether endometriosis has a significant impact on quality of life (QOL) for 
      adolescents and young adults. METHODS: Five hundred and sixty-seven participants 
      (360 cases and 207 controls) aged <25 years old who are enrolled in the Women's 
      Health Study: From Adolescence to Adulthood longitudinal study were included in 
      this analysis. Participants were enrolled from medical clinics and the 
      communities surrounding Boston, MA. Participants completed an expanded World 
      Endometriosis Research Foundation Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking 
      Harmonization Project standard clinical questionnaire that included the Short 
      Form-36 (SF-36), a widely used measure of health-related QOL. We calculated SF-36 
      physical component summary and mental component summary scores, as well as eight 
      subscale scores. On the SF-36, lower scores reflect greater impairment. RESULTS: 
      Adolescents with endometriosis had significantly lower physical component summary 
      (mean [standard deviation]: 43.4 [11.1] vs. 53.8 [7.6], p < .0001) and mental 
      component summary (43.3 [12.3] vs. 46.3 [10.8], p = .008) scores compared to 
      controls, as well as lower scores on all eight subscales. More cases than 
      controls reported mental health diagnoses, pain medication use, and avoidance of 
      exercise during menstruation. Among cases, earlier age at menarche, more severe 
      pelvic pain, and longer duration of diagnostic delay were associated with poorer 
      QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Endometriosis is associated with significantly worse reports of 
      QOL for adolescents and young women with endometriosis compared to unaffected 
      peers. Earlier menarche was associated with poorer physical health-related QOL 
      among cases, whereas severe pelvic pain was associated with both poorer physical 
      and mental health-related QOL among cases. Impairment in QOL is not limited to 
      adults with endometriosis, but affects younger patients as well.

AB  - Understanding how the genome instructs the phenotypic characteristics of an 
      organism is one of the major scientific endeavors of our time. Advances in 
      genetics have progressively deciphered the inheritance, identity and biological 
      relevance of genetically encoded information, contributing to the rise of 
      several, complementary omic disciplines. One of them is phenomics, an emergent 
      area of biology dedicated to the systematic multi-scale analysis of phenotypic 
      traits. This discipline provides valuable gene function information to the 
      rapidly evolving field of genetics. Current molecular tools enable genome-wide 
      analyses that link gene sequence to function in multi-cellular organisms, 
      illuminating the genome-phenome relationship. Among vertebrates, zebrafish has 
      emerged as an outstanding model organism for high-throughput phenotyping and 
      modeling of human disorders. Advances in both systematic mutagenesis and 
      phenotypic analyses of embryonic and post-embryonic stages in zebrafish have 
      revealed the function of a valuable collection of genes and the general structure 
      of several complex traits. In this review, we summarize multiple large-scale 
      genetic efforts addressing parental, embryonic, and adult phenotyping in the 
      zebrafish. The genetic and quantitative tools available in the zebrafish model, 
      coupled with the broad spectrum of phenotypes that can be assayed, make it a 
      powerful model for phenomics, well suited for the dissection of 
      genotype-phenotype associations in development, physiology, health and disease.

AB  - Health systems are stewards of patient electronic health record (EHR) data with 
      extraordinarily rich depth and breadth, reflecting thousands of diagnoses and 
      exposures. Measures of genomic variation integrated with EHRs offer a potential 
      strategy to accurately stratify patients for risk profiling and discover new 
      relationships between diagnoses and genomes. The objective of this study was to 
      evaluate whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) for common cancers are associated 
      with multiple phenotypes in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) conducted 
      in 28,260 unrelated, genotyped patients of recent European ancestry who consented 
      to participate in the Michigan Genomics Initiative, a longitudinal biorepository 
      effort within Michigan Medicine. PRS for 12 cancer traits were calculated using 
      summary statistics from the NHGRI-EBI catalog. A total of 1,711 synthetic 
      case-control studies was used for PheWAS analyses. There were 13,490 (47.7%) 
      patients with at least one cancer diagnosis in this study sample. PRS exhibited 
      strong association for several cancer traits they were designed for, including 
      female breast cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous 
      cell carcinoma, and thyroid cancer. Phenome-wide significant associations were 
      observed between PRS and many non-cancer diagnoses. To differentiate PRS 
      associations driven by the primary trait from associations arising through shared 
      genetic risk profiles, the idea of "exclusion PRS PheWAS" was introduced. Further 
      analysis of temporal order of the diagnoses improved our understanding of these 
      secondary associations. This comprehensive PheWAS used PRS instead of a single 
      variant.

TI  - A Modular Millifluidic Homeostatic Imaging Plate for Imaging of Larval Zebrafish.

AB  - Zebrafish larvae are suitable in vivo models for toxicological and 
      pharmacological screens due to their transparency, small size, ex utero 
      development, and genetic and physiological similarity to humans. Using modern 
      imaging techniques, cells and tissues can be dynamically visualized over several 
      days in multiple zebrafish larvae. However, precise specimen immobilization and 
      maintenance of homeostatic conditions remain a challenge for longitudinal 
      studies. A highly customizable mounting configuration with inbuilt means of 
      controlling temperature and media flow would therefore be a valuable tool to 
      facilitate long-term imaging of a large number of specimens. Using 
      three-dimensional printing, we have developed a millifluidic, modular homeostatic 
      imaging plate (HIP), which consists of a customizable sample insert and a 
      temperature-controlled incubation chamber that is continuously perfused, 
      providing an ideal environment for long-term experiments where homeostatic 
      conditions are desired. The HIP is cheap to produce, has a standard microtiter 
      well plate format, and can be fitted to most microscopes. We used the device to 
      image dynamic regeneration of spinal cord neurons. The flexibility and 
      adaptability of the HIP facilitate long-term in vivo imaging of many samples, and 
      can be easily adapted to suit a broad range of specimens.

AB  - The integration of phenotypes and genotypes is at an unprecedented level and 
      offers new opportunities to establish deep phenotypes. There are a number of 
      challenges to overcome, specifically, accelerated growth of data, data silos, 
      incompleteness, inaccuracies, and heterogeneity within and across data sources. 
      This perspective report discusses artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that 
      hold promise in addressing these challenges by automating computable phenotypes 
      and integrating them with genotypes. Collaborations between biomedical and AI 
      researchers will be highlighted in order to describe initial successes with an 
      eye toward the future.

AB  - Open-source electronics are becoming more prevalent in biological sciences, 
      enabling novel and unique means of data acquisition. Here, we present 3D-printed, 
      open-source tools to acquire fluorescence phenotypes with high temporal 
      resolution. Printed fluorescence imaging boxes (PFIboxes) cost approximately 
      200 US dollars to assemble, can be placed in incubators or hypoxic chambers, and 
      accurately read high-density colony arrays of microorganisms. We demonstrate the 
      utility of PFIboxes using a time course gene expression approach, examining 
      global Escherichia coli promoter activity using a fluorescent reporter library 
      across a diverse panel of 15 antibiotics, each at several concentrations. Many 
      secondary and indirect effects were observed when E. coli was challenged with 
      various drugs, including increased gene expression in carbon metabolism 
      processes. Further, kinetic data acquisition enabled non-destructive time course 
      gene expression, clustering of which revealed patterns of co-expression. In all, 
      PFIboxes provide an open solution to gene expression, for about 2 US dollars per 
      treatment condition, including technical replicates.

AB  - This study examines attitudes of the young Ghanaian population regarding the 
      relationship between causal beliefs and desire for social distance from people 
      with symptoms of schizophrenia and depression. Respondents (n = 507) were 
      presented with depression and schizophrenia symptoms using unlabeled case 
      vignettes. A factor analysis examined three factors for causal beliefs, and 
      multiple linear regression analysis on the desire for social distance was 
      conducted. The desire for social distance was higher when symptoms in both 
      case-vignettes were attributed to childhood adversities and overall lower when 
      respondents lived in northern regions of Ghana. Only, for vignettes depicting 
      schizophrenia, mental illness attribution was associated with more desire for 
      social distance. Significant gender effects were found for depression vignettes 
      only: female respondents reported significantly more desire for social distance, 
      whereas female gendered vignettes were associated with less desire for social 
      distance by respondents of both genders.

AB  - To understand how cognitive dysfunction contributes to social cognitive deficits 
      in depression, we investigated the relationship between executive function and 
      social cognitive performance in adolescents and young adults during current and 
      remitted depression, compared to healthy controls. Social cognition and executive 
      function were measured in 179 students (61 healthy controls and 118 patients with 
      depression; M(age) = 20.60 years; SD(age) = 3.82 years). Hierarchical regression 
      models were employed within each group (healthy controls, remitted depression, 
      current depression) to examine the nature of associations between cognitive 
      measures. Social cognitive and executive function did not significantly differ 
      overall between depressed patients and healthy controls. There was no association 
      between executive function and social cognitive function in healthy controls or 
      in remitted patients. However, in patients with a current state of depression, 
      lower cognitive flexibility was associated with lower performance in 
      facial-affect recognition, theory-of-mind tasks and overall affect recognition. 
      In this group, better planning abilities were associated with decreased 
      performance in facial affect recognition and overall social cognitive 
      performance. While we infer that less cognitive flexibility might lead to a more 
      rigid interpretation of ambiguous social stimuli, we interpret the 
      counterintuitive negative correlation of planning ability and social cognition as 
      a compensatory mechanism.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The complementary feeding (CF) comprises a period in the life of 
      the infant that starts with the introduction of foods other than breast-milk. It 
      is determined by social and environmental factors which facilitate or limit the 
      appropriate initiation of this practice, directly affecting the nutri tional and 
      health status of children. OBJECTIVE: To identify barriers and facilities for the 
      follow-up of nutritional recommendations regarding the early start of CF in 
      children between 0 and 24 months of age belonging to a comprehensive early 
      childhood care program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phenome nological, longitudinal, 
      qualitative study in which 43 in-depth interviews and 11 focus-groups were 
      carried out. Predefined categories were the context of the mother, 
      representations and experiences of gestation, meanings and experiences of 
      breastfeeding (BF), and CF. The analysis included the rela tionships between the 
      units of meaning and predefined and emerging categories. RESULTS: The CF is a 
      social practice which is the result of medical and popular knowledge mixture, 
      however, the degree of influence that the latter has on mothers is higher due to 
      the degree of support that they have from their close circle, especially from 
      mothers, grandmothers, and women of the family. The lack of con ceptual and 
      practical knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and CF prevents mothers 
      from carrying out good practices. Most of them do not know clearly what is 
      involved in the EBF, resulting in an early start of CF, or do not have objective 
      criteria to assess their milk production. Despite having received specific 
      training, CF started early in most cases, a fact in which close family influence 
      was decisive. CONCLUSIONS: The CF experience is strongly influenced by 
      sociocultural aspects not only of the mother but of her immediate circle, and the 
      recommendations they received from health pro fessionals are not enough to change 
      their practices. Therefore, it is necessary to improve CF support interventions.

AB  - Plant resistance to generalist pathogens with broad host ranges, such as Botrytis 
      cinerea (Botrytis), is typically quantitative and highly polygenic. Recent 
      studies have begun to elucidate the molecular genetic basis of plant-pathogen 
      interactions using commonly measured traits, including lesion size and/or 
      pathogen biomass. However, with the advent of digital imaging and high-throughput 
      phenomics, there are a large number of additional traits available to study 
      quantitative resistance. In this study, we used high-throughput digital imaging 
      analysis to investigate previously poorly characterized visual traits of 
      plant-pathogen interactions related to disease resistance using the Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana)/Botrytis pathosystem. From a large collection of visual 
      lesion trait measurements, we focused on color, shape, and size to test how these 
      aspects of the Arabidopsis/Botrytis interaction are genetically related. Through 
      genome-wide association mapping in Arabidopsis, we show that lesion color and 
      shape are genetically separable traits associated with plant disease resistance. 
      Moreover, by employing defined mutants in 23 candidate genes identified from the 
      genome-wide association mapping, we demonstrate links between loci and each of 
      the different plant-pathogen interaction traits. These results expand our 
      understanding of the functional mechanisms driving plant disease resistance.

TI  - Shared genetic etiology between alcohol dependence and major depressive disorder.
PG  - 66-70
LID - 10.1097/YPG.0000000000000201 [doi]
AB  - The clinical comorbidity of alcohol dependence (AD) and major depressive disorder 
      (MDD) is well established, whereas genetic factors influencing co-occurrence 
      remain unclear. A recent study using polygenic risk scores (PRS) calculated based 
      on the first-wave Psychiatric Genomics Consortium MDD meta-analysis (PGC-MDD1) 
      suggests a modest shared genetic contribution to MDD and AD. Using a (~10 fold) 
      larger discovery sample, we calculated PRS based on the second wave (PGC-MDD2) of 
      results, in a severe AD case–control target sample. We found significant 
      associations between AD disease status and MDD-PRS derived from both PGC-MDD2 
      (most informative P-threshold=1.0, P=0.00063, R2=0.533%) and PGC-MDD1 
      (P-threshold=0.2, P=0.00014, R2=0.663%) meta-analyses; the larger discovery 
      sample did not yield additional predictive power. In contrast, calculating PRS in 
      a MDD target sample yielded increased power when using PGC-MDD2 (P-threshold=1.0, 
      P=0.000038, R2=1.34%) versus PGC-MDD1 (P-threshold=1.0, P=0.0013, R2=0.81%). 
      Furthermore, when calculating PGC-MDD2 PRS in a subsample of patients with AD 
      recruited explicitly excluding comorbid MDD, significant associations were still 
      found (n=331; P-threshold=1.0, P=0.042, R2=0.398%). Meanwhile, in the subset of 
      patients in which MDD was not the explicit exclusion criteria, PRS predicted more 
      variance (n=999; P-threshold=1.0, P=0.0003, R2=0.693%). Our findings replicate 
      the reported genetic overlap between AD and MDD and also suggest the need for 
      improved, rigorous phenotyping to identify true shared cross-disorder genetic 
      factors. Larger target samples are needed to reduce noise and take advantage of 
      increasing discovery sample size.

TI  - Genomic information and a person's right not to know: A closer look at variations 
      in hypothetical informational preferences in a German sample.

AB  - In clinical practice and in research, there is an ongoing debate on how to return 
      incidental and secondary findings of genetic tests to patients and research 
      participants. Previous investigations have found that most of the people most of 
      the time are in favor of full disclosure of results. Yet, the option to reject 
      disclosure, based on the so-called right not to know, can be valuable especially 
      for some vulnerable subgroups of recipients. In the present study we investigated 
      variations in informational preferences in the context of genetic testing in a 
      large and diverse German sample. This survey examined health care professionals, 
      patients, participants of genetic counseling sessions and members of the general 
      population (N = 518). Survey participants were assessed regarding their openness 
      to learning about findings under various hypothetical scenarios, as well as their 
      attitudes about the doctor-patient-relationship in a disclosure situation and 
      about informational transfer to third parties. While the majority of participants 
      wanted to learn about their findings, the extent of support of disclosure varied 
      with features of the hypothetical diagnostic scenarios (e.g., controllability of 
      disease; abstract vs. concrete scenario description) and demographic 
      characteristics of the subjects. For example, subjects with higher levels of 
      education were more selective with regards to the kind of information they want 
      to receive than those with lower levels of education. We discuss implications of 
      these findings for the debate about the right not to know and for the clinical 
      practice of informed consent procedures.

AB  - Chronic metabolic diseases have been linked to molecular signatures of 
      mitochondrial dysfunction. Nonetheless, molecular remodeling of the 
      transcriptome, proteome, and/or metabolome does not necessarily translate to 
      functional consequences that confer physiologic phenotypes. The work here aims to 
      bridge the gap between molecular and functional phenomics by developing and 
      validating a multiplexed assay platform for comprehensive assessment of 
      mitochondrial energy transduction. The diagnostic power of the platform stems 
      from a modified version of the creatine kinase energetic clamp technique, 
      performed in parallel with multiplexed analyses of dehydrogenase activities and 
      ATP synthesis rates. Together, these assays provide diagnostic coverage of the 
      mitochondrial network at a level approaching that gained by molecular "-omics" 
      technologies. Application of the platform to a comparison of skeletal muscle 
      versus heart mitochondria reveals mechanistic insights into tissue-specific 
      distinctions in energy transfer efficiency. This platform opens exciting 
      opportunities to unravel the connection between mitochondrial bioenergetics and 
      human disease.

TI  - How Lactobacillus plantarum shapes its transcriptome in response to contrasting 
      habitats.
PG  - 3700-3716
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.14372 [doi]
AB  - Triplets of Lactobacullus plantarum strains were isolated from nine contrasting 
      habitats. Without any passage through other culture media, isolation and 
      cultivation were on model media that strictly reproduced the chemical and 
      physical conditions and stressors of the habitats of origin. Here, we 
      demonstrated how L. plantarum regulates and shapes its transcriptome in response 
      to contrasting habitats. Firstly, multivariate clustering analysis of 
      transcriptional data (RNA-Seq), complemented with metabolomics and phenomics, 
      grouped the strains according to the habitats of origin. Subsequently, selected 
      strains from each habitat switched to repeated cultivation on MRS medium and 
      transcriptomes homogenized into a unique cluster. Adaptation to this common 
      medium mainly relied on activation of genes for phage- and prophage-related 
      proteins and transposases. Finally, the comparison of growth across model media 
      and with respect to MRS medium showed that 44% of the overall 3112 gene 
      transcripts changed depending on the specific habitat. Regulation and shaping of 
      transcriptomes mainly concerned carbohydrate acquisition, pyruvate catabolism, 
      proteolytic system and amino acid, lipid and inorganic ion transport and 
      metabolism, with contrasting responses for contrasting habitats. Pathways 
      reconstruction demonstrated how the large genome size of L. plantarum imparts 
      transcriptome and metabolic flexibility as the basic mechanism for a nomadic 
      lifestyle.

AB  - Pattern recognition, using a group of characteristic, or discriminating features, 
      is a powerful tool in metabolic diagnostic. A classic example of this approach is 
      used in biochemical analysis of urine organic acid analysis, where the reporting 
      depends more on the correlation of pertinent positive and negative findings, 
      rather than on the absolute values of specific markers. Similar uses of pattern 
      recognition in the field of biochemical genetics include the interpretation of 
      data obtained by metabolomics, like glycomics, where a recognizable pattern or 
      the presence of a specific glycan sub-fraction can lead to the direct diagnosis 
      of certain types of congenital disorders of glycosylation. Another indispensable 
      tool is the use of clinical pattern recognition-or syndromology-relying on 
      careful phenotyping. While genomics might uncover variants not essential in the 
      final clinical expression of disease, and metabolomics could point to a mixture 
      of primary but also secondary changes in biochemical pathways, phenomics 
      describes the clinically relevant manifestations and the full expression of the 
      disease. In the current review we apply phenomics to the field of congenital 
      disorders of glycosylation, focusing on recognizable differentiating findings in 
      glycosylation disorders, characteristic dysmorphic features and malformations in 
      PMM2-CDG, and overlapping patterns among the currently known glycosylation 
      disorders based on their pathophysiological basis.

TI  - Relationship between very low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations 
      not due to statin therapy and risk of type 2 diabetes: A US-based cross-sectional 
      observational study using electronic health records.
PG  - e1002642
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002642 [doi]
LID - e1002642
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observations from statin clinical trials and from Mendelian 
      randomization studies suggest that low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
      (LDL-C) concentrations may be associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM). Despite the findings from statin clinical trials and genetic 
      studies, there is little direct evidence implicating low LDL-C concentrations in 
      increased risk of T2DM. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used de-identified electronic 
      health records (EHRs) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center to compare the risk 
      of T2DM in a cross-sectional study among individuals with very low (≤60 mg/dl, N 
      = 8,943) and normal (90-130 mg/dl, N = 71,343) LDL-C levels calculated using the 
      Friedewald formula. LDL-C levels associated with statin use, hospitalization, or 
      a serum albumin level < 3 g/dl were excluded. We used a 2-phase approach: in 1/3 
      of the sample (discovery) we used T2DM phenome-wide association study codes 
      (phecodes) to identify cases and controls, and in the remaining 2/3 (validation) 
      we identified T2DM cases and controls using a validated algorithm. The analysis 
      plan for the validation phase was constructed at the time of the design of that 
      component of the study. The prevalence of T2DM in the very low and normal LDL-C 
      groups was compared using logistic regression with adjustment for age, race, sex, 
      body mass index (BMI), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and 
      duration of care. Secondary analyses included prespecified stratification by sex, 
      race, BMI, and LDL-C level. In the discovery cohort, phecodes related to T2DM 
      were significantly more frequent in the very low LDL-C group. In the validation 
      cohort (N = 33,039 after applying the T2DM algorithm to identify cases and 
      controls), the risk of T2DM was increased in the very low compared to normal 
      LDL-C group (odds ratio [OR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.80-2.37; P < 2 × 10-16). The findings 
      remained significant in sensitivity analyses. The association between low LDL-C 
      levels and T2DM was significant in males (OR 2.43, 95% CI 2.00-2.95; P < 2 × 
      10-16) and females (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.42-2.12; P = 6.88 × 10-8); in normal weight 
      (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.59-2.98; P = 1.1× 10-6), overweight (OR 2.17, 95% CI 
      1.65-2.83; P = 1.73× 10-8), and obese (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.65-2.41; P = 8 × 10-13) 
      categories; and in individuals with LDL-C < 40 mg/dl (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.71-3.10; 
      P = 3.01× 10-8) and LDL-C 40-60 mg/dl (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.71-2.32; P < 2.0× 
      10-16). The association was significant in individuals of European ancestry (OR 
      2.67, 95% CI 2.25-3.17; P < 2 × 10-16) but not in those of African ancestry (OR 
      1.09, 95% CI 0.81-1.46; P = 0.56). A limitation was that we only compared groups 
      with very low and normal LDL-C levels; also, since this was not an inception 
      cohort, we cannot exclude the possibility of reverse causation. CONCLUSIONS: Very 
      low LDL-C concentrations occurring in the absence of statin treatment were 
      significantly associated with T2DM risk in a large EHR population; this increased 
      risk was present in both sexes and all BMI categories, and in individuals of 
      European ancestry but not of African ancestry. Longitudinal cohort studies to 
      assess the relationship between very low LDL-C levels not associated with 
      lipid-lowering therapy and risk of developing T2DM will be important.

AB  - Ancestry composition of populations and individuals has been extensively 
      investigated in recent years due to advances in the genotyping and sequencing 
      technologies. As the number of populations and individuals used for ancestry 
      inference increases remarkably, say more than 100 populations or 1000 
      individuals, it is usually challenging to present the ancestry composition in a 
      traditional way using a rectangular graph. To address this issue, we developed a 
      program, AncestryPainter, which can illustrate the ancestry composition of 
      populations and individuals with a rounded and nice-looking graph to save space. 
      Individuals are depicted as length-fixed bars partitioned into colored segments 
      representing different ancestries, and the population of interest can be 
      highlighted as a pie chart in the center of the circle plot. In addition, 
      AncestryPainter can also be applied to display personal ancestry in a way similar 
      to that for displaying population ancestry. AncestryPainter is publicly available 
      at http://www.picb.ac.cn/PGG/resource.php.

TI  - Family-Based Genome-Wide Association Study of South Indian Pedigrees Supports 
      WNT7B as a Central Corneal Thickness Locus.
PG  - 2495-2502
LID - 10.1167/iovs.17-23536 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify genetic risk factors contributing to central corneal 
      thickness (CCT) in individuals from South India, a population with a high 
      prevalence of ocular disorders. METHODS: One hundred ninety-five individuals from 
      15 large South Indian pedigrees were genotyped using the Omni2.5 bead array. 
      Family-based association for CCT was conducted using the score test in MERLIN. 
      RESULTS: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified strongest association 
      for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the first intron of WNT7B and CCT 
      (top SNP rs9330813; β = -0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.78 to -0.36; P = 
      1.7 × 10-7). We further investigated rs9330813 in a Latino cohort and four 
      independent European cohorts. A meta-analysis of these data sets demonstrated 
      statistically significant association between rs9330813 and CCT (β = -3.94, 95% 
      CI: -5.23 to -2.66; P = 1.7 × 10-9). WNT7B SNPs located in the same genomic 
      region that includes rs9330813 have previously been associated with CCT in 
      Latinos but with other ocular quantitative traits related to myopia (corneal 
      curvature and axial length) in a Japanese population (rs10453441 and 
      rs200329677). To evaluate the specificity of the observed WNT7B association with 
      CCT in the South Indian families, we completed an ocular phenome-wide association 
      study (PheWAS) for the top WNT7B SNPs using 45 ocular traits measured in these 
      same families including corneal curvature and axial length. The ocular PheWAS 
      results indicate that in the South Indian families WNT7B SNPs are primarily 
      associated with CCT. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate robust evidence for 
      association between WNT7B SNPs and CCT in South Indian pedigrees, and suggest 
      that WNT7B SNPs can have population-specific effects on ocular quantitative 
      traits.

TI  - Fungal Endophytes Control Fusarium graminearum and Reduce Trichothecenes and 
      Zearalenone in Maize.
LID - 10.3390/toxins10120493 [doi]
LID - 493
AB  - Fusarium graminearum can cause Giberella Ear Rot (GER) and seedling blight in 
      maize, resulting in major yield losses. Besides GER, the infected grains are 
      consequently contaminated with multiple mycotoxins of F. graminearum. Zearalenone 
      and trichothecenes, such as deoxynivalenol and its acetylated forms, are among 
      the major mycotoxins associated with F. graminearum infection in maize. In the 
      current work, we explored the effect of the endophytic fungal genera of Epicoccum 
      and Sordaria, to control F. graminearum infection in comparative trials with 
      Piriformospora spp., an elusive endophytic genus. Furthermore, we investigated 
      the effect of these endophytes on zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, and 
      15-acetyldeoxynivalenol levels using in vitro and in planta assays. As plants are 
      endowed with several detoxification mechanisms comprising e.g., glucosylation of 
      trichothecenes, the effect of the isolated fungal endophytes on the 
      deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside level was also assessed. In general, results showed a 
      considerable variability in the antifungal activity, both among species and among 
      isolates within one species. Additionally, the effect on mycotoxin levels was 
      variable, and not necessarily related to the antifungal activity except for 
      zearalenone levels which were consistently reduced by the endophytes. These 
      results highlight the great potential of certain endophytic fungal strains as new 
      biocontrol agents in agricultural science.

TI  - Does the endometrial gene expression of fertile women vary within and between 
      cycles?
PG  - 452-463
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dex385 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Does gene expression of putative endometrial implantation markers 
      vary in expression between menstrual cycles? SUMMARY ANSWER: In fertile women the 
      expression of certain genes exhibits a pattern of stable regulation.which is not 
      affected even when sampled twice in one cycle. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Successful 
      implantation occurs in a minority of IVF embryo transfers. In contrast to 
      knowledge regarding the ovulatory process, there is a sparse understanding of 
      endometrial genes critical to implantation. This lack of knowledge hinders 
      progress in this field. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Endometrial pipelle samples 
      were collected based on blood endocrinological markers at 2 and 7 days post 
      initial LH surge. Five samples were collected over four cycles where the interval 
      between collections ranged from sequential months to three years. 
      PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Six fertile women attending an IVF 
      clinic for male factor infertility, had samples collected. Global gene expression 
      profiles were obtained from laser-microdissected, endometrial glands and stroma. 
      Nineteen potential proliferation, cytokine and adhesion markers based on previous 
      validated reports were studied. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: There was a 
      significant modification between LH+2 and LH+7 of expression for 23 genes-11 in 8 
      in glands and stroma, 4 in stroma only and 3 in glands only suggesting stable, 
      controlled regulation. Nevertheless, genes exhibited individual characteristics, 
      e.g MKI67 exhibited lower expression at LH+7 than LH+2 and CCL4 higher, whereas 
      TRO expressed limited difference in both cell types. Stability between cycles was 
      demonstrated for gene expression at both LH+2-more than 60% of genes had <25% 
      variation and at LH+7-60% had <30% variation. Further, effects of prior 
      collection of an LH+2 sample on gene expression at LH+7 were not detected. The 
      range of mRNA expression suggested that a clinical/diagnostic sample at LH+2 and 
      LH+7 is likely to be a better index of endometrial function than a single sample. 
      The possibility of redundancy suggests a panel would be more informative than a 
      single marker. LARGE SCALE DATA: Raw and normalized microarray data have been 
      deposited with the EMBL's European Genome-Phenome Archive for collaborative 
      analysis, reference ega-box-815 (Lappalainen I, Almeida-King J, Kumanduri V, Senf 
      A, Spalding JD, Ur-Rehman S, Saunders G, Kandasamy J, Caccamo M, Leinonen R et 
      al. The European Genome-phenome Archive of human data consented for biomedical 
      research. Nat Genet 2015;47:692-695.) [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/home]. 
      LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This type of research has difficulties of 
      recruitment of fertile women for multiple blood testing and repeat endometrial 
      biopsies. Therefore, these data had decreased statistical power due to the 
      overall participant numbers. However, the inclusion of four cycles for each 
      participant permitted the aim of obtaining information on intercycle and 
      intracycle variability to be achieved. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our 
      results support the feasibility of a clinical means of identification of a 
      functional receptive endometrium. The robustness of data from individual women 
      suggests that samples from one cycle can generally be applied to subsequent 
      cycles. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): Funding was granted from the 
      Tertiary Education Commission of New Zealand, Contract I.D.:UOOX06007. There are

AB  - This paper develops a new machine vision framework for efficient detection and 
      classification of manufacturing defects in metal boxes. Previous techniques, 
      which are based on either visual inspection or on hand-crafted features, are both 
      inaccurate and time consuming. In this paper, we show that by using autoencoder 
      deep neural network (DNN) architecture, we are able to not only classify 
      manufacturing defects, but also localize them with high accuracy. Compared to 
      traditional techniques, DNNs are able to learn, in a supervised manner, the 
      visual features that achieve the best performance. Our experiments on a database 
      of real images demonstrate that our approach overcomes the state-of-the-art while 
      remaining computationally competitive.

TI  - Using Y-Chromosomal Haplogroups in Genetic Association Studies and Suggested 
      Implications.
LID - 10.3390/genes9010045 [doi]
LID - 45
AB  - Y-chromosomal (Y-DNA) haplogroups are more widely used in population genetics 
      than in genetic epidemiology, although associations between Y-DNA haplogroups and 
      several traits, including cardiometabolic traits, have been reported. In 
      apparently homogeneous populations defined by principal component analyses, there 
      is still Y-DNA haplogroup variation which will result from population history. 
      Therefore, hidden stratification and/or differential phenotypic effects by Y-DNA 
      haplogroups could exist. To test this, we hypothesised that stratifying 
      individuals according to their Y-DNA haplogroups before testing for associations 
      between autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotypes will 
      yield difference in association. For proof of concept, we derived Y-DNA 
      haplogroups from 6537 males from two epidemiological cohorts, Avon Longitudinal 
      Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (n = 5080; 816 Y-DNA SNPs) and the 1958 
      Birth Cohort (n = 1457; 1849 Y-DNA SNPs), and studied the robust associations 
      between 32 SNPs and body mass index (BMI), including SNPs in or near Fat Mass and 
      Obesity-associated protein (FTO) which yield the strongest effects. Overall, no 
      association was replicated in both cohorts when Y-DNA haplogroups were considered 
      and this suggests that, for BMI at least, there is little evidence of differences 
      in phenotype or SNP association by Y-DNA structure. Further studies using other 
      traits, phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), other haplogroups and/or 
      autosomal SNPs are required to test the generalisability and utility of this 
      approach.

      Biomass and Nitrogen Status of Wheat in Early and Late Tillering Stages.

LID - 1478
AB  - Proximal remote sensing systems depending on spectral reflectance measurements 
      and image analysis can acquire timely information to make real-time management 
      decisions compared to laborious destructive measurements. There is a need to make 
      nitrogen management decisions at early development stages of cereals when the 
      first top-dressing is made. However, there is insufficient information available 
      about the possibility of detecting differences in the biomass or the nitrogen 
      status of cereals at early development stages and even less comparing its 
      relationship to destructively obtained information. The performance of 
      hyperspectral passive reflectance sensing and digital image analysis was tested 
      in a 2-year study to assess the nitrogen uptake and nitrogen concentration, as 
      well as the biomass fresh and dry weight at early and late tillering stages of 
      wheat from BBCH 19 to 30. Wheat plants were subjected to different levels of 
      nitrogen fertilizer applications and differences in biomass, and the nitrogen 
      status was further created by varying the seeding rate. To analyze the spectral 
      and digital imaging data simple linear regression and partial least squares 
      regression (PLSR) models were used. The green pixel digital analysis, spectral 
      reflectance indices and PLSR of spectral reflectance from 400 to 1000 nm were 
      strongly related to the nitrogen uptake and the biomass fresh and dry weights at 
      individual measurements and for the combined dataset at the early crop 
      development stages. Relationships between green pixels, spectral reflectance 
      indices and PLSR with the biomass and nitrogen status parameters reached 
      coefficients of determination up to 0.95(∗∗) through the individual measurements 
      and the combined data set. Reflectance-based spectral sensing compared to digital 
      image analysis allows detecting differences in the biomass and nitrogen status 
      already at early growth stages in the tillering phase. Spectral reflectance 
      indices are probably more robust and can more easily be applied compared to PLSR 
      models. This might pave the way for more informed management decisions and 
      potentially lead to improved nitrogen fertilizer management at early development 
      stages.

AB  - Human ageing is an extremely personal process leading across the life course of 
      individuals to large population heterogeneity in the decline of functional 
      capacity, health and lifespan. The extremes of this process are witnessed by the 
      healthy vital 100-year-olds on one end and the 60-year-olds suffering from 
      multiple morbid conditions on the other end of the spectrum. Molecular studies 
      into the basis of this heterogeneity have focused on a range of endpoints and 
      methodological approaches. The phenotype definitions most prominently 
      investigated in these studies are either lifespan-related or biomarker based 
      indices of the biological ageing rate of individuals and their tissues. Unlike 
      for many complex, age-related diseases, consensus on the ultimate set of 
      multi-biomarker ageing or lifespan-related phenotypes for genetic and genomic 
      studies has not been reached yet. Comparable to animal models, hallmarks of 
      age-related disease risk, healthy ageing and longevity include immune and 
      metabolic pathways. Potentially novel genomic regions and pathways have been 
      identified among many (epi)genomic studies into chronological age and studies 
      into human lifespan regulation, with APOE and FOXO3A representing yet the most 
      robust loci. Functional analysis of a handful of genes in cell-based and animal 
      models is ongoing. The way forward in human ageing and longevity studies seems 
      through improvements in the interpretation of the biology of the genome, in 
      application of computational and systems biology, integration with animal models 
      and by harmonization of repeated phenotypic and omics measures in longitudinal

AB  - Drought and heat in dryland agriculture challenge the enhancement of crop 
      productivity and threaten global food security. This review is centered on 
      harnessing genetic variation through biotechnology-led approaches to select for 
      increased productivity and stress tolerance that will enhance crop adaptation in 
      dryland environments. Peer-reviewed literature, mostly from the last decade and 
      involving experiments with at least two seasons' data, form the basis of this 
      review. It begins by highlighting the adverse impact of the increasing intensity 
      and duration of drought and heat stress due to global warming on crop 
      productivity and its impact on food and nutritional security in dryland 
      environments. This is followed by (1) an overview of the physiological and 
      molecular basis of plant adaptation to elevated CO(2) (eCO(2)), drought, and heat 
      stress; (2) the critical role of high-throughput phenotyping platforms to study 
      phenomes and genomes to increase breeding efficiency; (3) opportunities to 
      enhance stress tolerance and productivity in food crops (cereals and grain 
      legumes) by deploying biotechnology-led approaches [pyramiding quantitative trait 
      loci (QTL), genomic selection, marker-assisted recurrent selection, epigenetic 
      variation, genome editing, and transgene) and inducing flowering independent of 
      environmental clues to match the length of growing season; (4) opportunities to 
      increase productivity in C(3) crops by harnessing novel variations (genes and 
      network) in crops' (C(3), C(4)) germplasm pools associated with increased 
      photosynthesis; and (5) the adoption, impact, risk assessment, and enabling 
      policy environments to scale up the adoption of seed-technology to enhance food 
      and nutritional security. This synthesis of technological innovations and 
      insights in seed-based technology offers crop genetic enhancers further 
      opportunities to increase crop productivity in dryland environments.

AB  - Experimental recordings in hippocampal slices indicate that astrocytic 
      dysfunction may cause neuronal hyper-excitation or seizures. Considering that 
      astrocytes play important roles in mediating local uptake and spatial buffering 
      of K+ in the extracellular space of the cortical circuit, we constructed a novel 
      model of an astrocyte-neuron network module consisting of a single compartment 
      neuron and 4 surrounding connected astrocytes and including extracellular 
      potassium dynamics. Next, we developed a new model function for the astrocyte gap 
      junctions, connecting two astrocyte-neuron network modules. The function form and 
      parameters of the gap junction were based on nonlinear regression fitting of a 
      set of experimental data published in previous studies. Moreover, we have created 
      numerical simulations using the above single astrocyte-neuron network module and 
      the coupled astrocyte-neuron network modules. Our model validates previous 
      experimental observations that both Kir4.1 channels and gap junctions play 
      important roles in regulating the concentration of extracellular potassium. In 
      addition, we also observe that changes in Kir4.1 channel conductance and gap 
      junction strength induce spontaneous epileptic activity in the absence of 
      external stimuli.

TI  - Correlation between Diabetes Mellitus and Knee Osteoarthritis: A Dry-To-Wet Lab 
      Approach.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19103021 [doi]
LID - 3021
AB  - Recent years have witnessed an increased prevalence of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) 
      among diabetes mellitus (DM) patients-conditions which might share common risk 
      factors such as obesity and advanced aging. Therefore, we conducted dry-to-wet 
      lab research approaches to assess the correlation of type 1 DM (T1DM) and type 2 
      DM (T2DM) with KOA among all age and genders of Taiwanese population. The 
      strength of association (odds ratio: OR) was analyzed using a phenome-wide 
      association study portal. Populations of 37,353 T1DM and 1,218,254 T2DM were 
      included. We observed a significant association of KOA with T1DM (OR: 1.40 
      (1.33⁻1.47), p< 0.0001) and T2DM (OR: 2.75 (2.72⁻2.78), p< 0.0001). The 
      association between T1DM and KOA among the obese (OR: 0.99 (0.54⁻1.67), p = 
      0.0477) was insignificant compared to the non-obese (OR: 1.40 (1.33⁻1.48), p < 
      0.0001). Interestingly, a higher association between T2DM and KOA among non-obese 
      persons (OR: 2.75, (2.72⁻2.79), p < 0.0001) compared to the obese (OR: 1.71 
      (1.55⁻1.89), p < 0.0001) was noted. Further, histopathologic and Western blot 
      studies of diabetic mice knee joints revealed enhanced carboxymethyl lysine 
      (advanced glycation end product), matrix metalloproteinase-1, and reduced 
      cartilage-specific proteins, including type II collagen (Col II), SOX9, and 
      aggrecan (AGN), indicating deteriorated articular cartilage and proteoglycans. 
      Results indicate that DM is strongly associated with KOA, and obesity may not be 
      a confounding factor.

AB  - Dynamic quantification of drought response is a key issue both for variety 
      selection and for functional genetic study of rice drought resistance. 
      Traditional assessment of drought resistance traits, such as stay-green and 
      leaf-rolling, has utilized manual measurements, that are often subjective, 
      error-prone, poorly quantified and time consuming. To relieve this phenotyping 
      bottleneck, we demonstrate a feasible, robust and non-destructive method that 
      dynamically quantifies response to drought, under both controlled and field 
      conditions. Firstly, RGB images of individual rice plants at different growth 
      points were analyzed to derive 4 features that were influenced by imposition of 
      drought. These include a feature related to the ability to stay green, which we 
      termed greenness plant area ratio (GPAR) and 3 shape descriptors [total plant 
      area/bounding rectangle area ratio (TBR), perimeter area ratio (PAR) and total 
      plant area/convex hull area ratio (TCR)]. Experiments showed that these 4 
      features were capable of discriminating reliably between drought resistant and 
      drought sensitive accessions, and dynamically quantifying the drought response 
      under controlled conditions across time (at either daily or half hourly time 
      intervals). We compared the 3 shape descriptors and concluded that PAR was more 
      robust and sensitive to leaf-rolling than the other shape descriptors. In 
      addition, PAR and GPAR proved to be effective in quantification of drought 
      response in the field. Moreover, the values obtained in field experiments using 
      the collection of rice varieties were correlated with those derived from 
      pot-based experiments. The general applicability of the algorithms is 
      demonstrated by their ability to probe archival Miscanthus data previously 
      collected on an independent platform. In conclusion, this image-based technology 
      is robust providing a platform-independent tool for quantifying drought response 
      that should be of general utility for breeding and functional genomics in future.

AB  - The use of molecular data for documenting biodiversity has become more common 
      over time as larger datasets can be generated faster. Nevertheless, studies 
      addressing phenotypical data have not become as common. As a collateral effect, 
      many samples used in molecular studies are assigned to a species without checking 
      phenomic characters of the vouchers. Correct specific assignment is paramount for 
      any biological hypothesis. A recent review of Phyzelaphryninae, while producing 
      interesting results, has not specified how some vouchers used in molecular 
      analyses were assigned to each species. Using new sequences from fresh material 
      collected in Southern Bahia, we re-identify Adelophryne specimens based on 
      molecular and morphological grounds. This new taxonomic understanding clarifies 
      the phylogenetic position of A. pachydactyla and highlights a more parsimonious 
      explanation for the evolution of a morphological character-the reduction of a 
      phalange on Finger IV-within Adelophryne.

TI  - Polygenic prediction of the phenome, across ancestry, in emerging adulthood.
PG  - 1814-1823

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying genetic relationships between complex traits in emerging 
      adulthood can provide useful etiological insights into risk for psychopathology. 
      College-age individuals are under-represented in genomic analyses thus far, and 
      the majority of work has focused on the clinical disorder or cognitive abilities 
      rather than normal-range behavioral outcomes. METHODS: This study examined a 
      sample of emerging adults 18-22 years of age (N = 5947) to construct an atlas of 
      polygenic risk for 33 traits predicting relevant phenotypic outcomes. 
      Twenty-eight hypotheses were tested based on the previous literature on samples 
      of European ancestry, and the availability of rich assessment data allowed for 
      polygenic predictions across 55 psychological and medical phenotypes. RESULTS: 
      Polygenic risk for schizophrenia (SZ) in emerging adults predicted anxiety, 
      depression, nicotine use, trauma, and family history of psychological disorders. 
      Polygenic risk for neuroticism predicted anxiety, depression, phobia, panic, 
      neuroticism, and was correlated with polygenic risk for cardiovascular disease. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the extensive impact of genetic risk for 
      SZ, neuroticism, and major depression on a range of health outcomes in early 
      adulthood. Minimal cross-ancestry replication of these phenomic patterns of 
      polygenic influence underscores the need for more genome-wide association studies 
      of non-European populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In studies of plant stress signaling, a major challenge is the lack 
      of non-invasive methods to detect physiological plant responses and to 
      characterize plant-plant communication over time and space. RESULTS: We acquired 
      time series of phytocompound and hyperspectral imaging data from maize plants 
      from the following treatments: (1) individual non-infested plants, (2) individual 
      plants experimentally subjected to herbivory by green belly stink bug (no visible 
      symptoms of insect herbivory), (3) one plant subjected to insect herbivory and 
      one control plant in a separate pot but inside the same cage, and (4) one plant 
      subjected to insect herbivory and one control plant together in the same pot. 
      Individual phytocompounds (except indole-3acetic acid) or spectral bands were not 
      reliable indicators of neither insect herbivory nor plant-plant communication. 
      However, using a linear discrimination classification method based on 
      combinations of either phytocompounds or spectral bands, we found clear evidence 
      of maize plant responses. CONCLUSIONS: We have provided initial evidence of how 
      hyperspectral imaging may be considered a powerful non-invasive method to 
      increase our current understanding of both direct plant responses to biotic 
      stressors but also to the multiple ways plant communities are able to 
      communicate. We are unaware of any published studies, in which comprehensive 
      phytocompound data have been shown to correlate with leaf reflectance. In 
      addition, we are unaware of published studies, in which plant-plant communication 
      was studied based on leaf reflectance.

TI  - Spectrum of symptoms in women diagnosed with endometriosis during adolescence vs 
      adulthood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endometriosis symptoms often start at a young age, and the time 
      between symptom onset and endometriosis diagnosis can be several years. It is not 
      clear whether the symptoms that are experienced by adolescents differ from 
      adults. Better understanding may shorten the often lengthy delay in diagnosis. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to further elucidate the symptom 
      presentation of adolescents as compared with adults to determine whether 
      differences existed, based on age at surgical diagnosis that could impact time to 
      diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: This investigation was a cross-sectional study at 
      enrollment within a longitudinal cohort of adolescents and women with 
      endometriosis. The population-based cohort was recruited from 2 tertiary care 
      centers and the surrounding communities. Participants included adolescents 
      (diagnosed at ≤18 years old; n=295) and adults (diagnosed at >18 years old; 
      n=107) with surgically confirmed endometriosis who were enrolled into The Women's 
      Health Study: From Adolescence to Adulthood. Participants completed an expanded 
      version of the World Endometriosis Research Foundation Endometriosis Phenome and 
      Biobanking Harmonization Project standard clinical questionnaire that included 
      items regarding menstrual history, associated symptoms, and pain. Chi-square or 
      Fisher's exact tests were applied to categoric data; Wilcoxon rank sum tests were 
      applied to continuous data. RESULTS: Most participants (90%) experienced 
      moderate-severe menstrual pain. On average, 3 doctors were seen before diagnosis, 
      regardless of age at presentation (range, 0-25 years). Time from symptoms to 
      diagnosis averaged 2 years for adolescents and 5 years for adults (P<.001). More 
      adolescents (50%) than adults (33%) reported pain starting at menarche (P=.002) 
      and nausea accompanying pain (69% vs 53%; P=.01). Noncyclic, general pelvic pain 
      was prevalent. One-half of the participants reported relief of their general 
      pelvic pain after a bowel movement. Pain interfered with work/school, daily 
      activities, exercise, and sleep to a moderate-extreme degree; difficulties were 
      similar by age at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic pain was severe and noncyclic 
      and negatively impacted quality of life. At our tertiary care centers, symptoms 
      of endometriosis did not differ between women surgically diagnosed during 
      adolescence compared with those diagnosed as adults. Adolescents had more nausea 
      and symptom onset at menarche. Multi-year delays in diagnosis were common. 
      Clinicians should be aware of these alternate symptom patterns and include 
      endometriosis in their differential diagnosis for both adolescent and young adult 
      women who experience noncyclic pelvic pain and nausea.

AB  - Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) have been proposed as a possible aid in 
      drug development through elucidating mechanisms of action, identifying 
      alternative indications, or predicting adverse drug events (ADEs). Here, we 
      select 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked through genome-wide 
      association studies (GWAS) to 19 candidate drug targets for common disease 
      indications. We interrogate these SNPs by PheWAS in four large cohorts with 
      extensive health information (23andMe, UK Biobank, FINRISK, CHOP) for association 
      with 1683 binary endpoints in up to 697,815 individuals and conduct meta-analyses 
      for 145 mapped disease endpoints. Our analyses replicate 75% of known GWAS 
      associations (P < 0.05) and identify nine study-wide significant novel 
      associations (of 71 with FDR < 0.1). We describe associations that may predict 
      ADEs, e.g., acne, high cholesterol, gout, and gallstones with rs738409 (p.I148M) 
      in PNPLA3 and asthma with rs1990760 (p.T946A) in IFIH1. Our results demonstrate 
      PheWAS as a powerful addition to the toolkit for drug discovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The genes of SPARC, CCR2, and SMAD3 are implicated in orchestrating 
      inflammatory response that leads to fibrosis in scleroderma and other fibrotic 
      disorders. The aim of the studies is to evaluate synergistic anti-fibrotic 
      potency of the siRNAs of these genes. METHODS: The efficacy of the 
      siRNA-combination was evaluated in bleomycin-induced mouse fibrosis. The 
      pathological changes of skin and lungs of the mice were assessed by hematoxylin 
      and eosin and Masson's trichrome stains. The expression of inflammation and 
      fibrosis associated genes and proteins in the tissues were assessed by real-time 
      RT-PCR, RNA sequencing, Western blots and ELISA. Non-crosslinked fibrillar 
      collagen was measured by the Sircol colorimetric assay. FINDINGS: The 
      applications of the combined siRNAs in bleomycin-induced mice achieved favorable 
      anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Activation of fibroblasts was 
      suppressed in parallel with inhibition of inflammation evidenced by reduced 
      inflammatory cells and proinflammatory cytokines in the BALF and/or the tissues 
      by the treatment. Aberrant expression of the genes normally expressed in 
      fibroblasts, monocytes/ macrophage, endothelial and epithelial cells were 
      significantly restrained after the treatment. In addition, transcriptome profiles 
      indicated that some bleomycin-induced alterations of multiple biological pathways 
      were recovered to varying degrees by the treatment. INTERPRETATION: The 
      application of the combined siRNAs of SPARC, CCR2, and SMAD3 genes ameliorated 
      inflammation and fibrosis in bleomycin-induced mice. It systemically reinstated 
      multiple biopathways, probably through controlling on different cell types 
      including fibroblasts, monocytes/macrophages, endothelial cells and others. The 
      multi-target-combined therapeutic approach examined herein may represent a novel 
      and effective therapy for fibrosis.

TI  - MS/MS-Based Molecular Networking Approach for the Detection of 
      Aplysiatoxin-Related Compounds in Environmental Marine Cyanobacteria.
LID - 10.3390/md16120505 [doi]
LID - 505
AB  - Certain strains of cyanobacteria produce a wide array of cyanotoxins, such as 
      microcystins, lyngbyatoxins and aplysiatoxins, that are associated with public 
      health issues. In this pilot study, an approach combining LC-MS/MS and molecular 
      networking was employed as a rapid analytical method to detect aplysiatoxins 
      present in four environmental marine cyanobacterial samples collected from 
      intertidal areas in Singapore. Based on 16S-ITS rRNA gene sequences, these 
      filamentous cyanobacterial samples collected from Pulau Hantu were determined as 
      Trichodesmium erythraeum, Oscillatoria sp. PAB-2 and Okeania sp. PNG05-4. Organic 
      extracts were prepared and analyzed on LC-HRMS/MS and Global Natural Product 
      Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) for the presence of aplysiatoxin-related 
      molecules. From the molecular networking, six known compounds, 
      debromoaplysiatoxin (1), anhydrodebromoaplysiatoxin (2), 
      3-methoxydebromoaplysiatoxin (3), aplysiatoxin (4), oscillatoxin A (5) and 
      31-noroscillatoxin B (6), as well as potential new analogues, were detected in 
      these samples. In addition, differences and similarities in molecular networking 
      clusters related to the aplysiatoxin molecular family were observed in extracts 
      of Trichodesmium erythraeum collected from two different locations and from 
      different cyanobacterial species found at Pulau Hantu, respectively.

TI  - Sunflower Hybrid Breeding: From Markers to Genomic Selection.
PG  - 2238
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2017.02238 [doi]
LID - 2238
AB  - In sunflower, molecular markers for simple traits as, e.g., fertility 
      restoration, high oleic acid content, herbicide tolerance or resistances to 
      Plasmopara halstedii, Puccinia helianthi, or Orobanche cumana have been 
      successfully used in marker-assisted breeding programs for years. However, 
      agronomically important complex quantitative traits like yield, heterosis, 
      drought tolerance, oil content or selection for disease resistance, e.g., against 
      Sclerotinia sclerotiorum have been challenging and will require genome-wide 
      approaches. Plant genetic resources for sunflower are being collected and 
      conserved worldwide that represent valuable resources to study complex traits. 
      Sunflower association panels provide the basis for genome-wide association 
      studies, overcoming disadvantages of biparental populations. Advances in 
      technologies and the availability of the sunflower genome sequence made novel 
      approaches on the whole genome level possible. Genotype-by-sequencing, and whole 
      genome sequencing based on next generation sequencing technologies facilitated 
      the production of large amounts of SNP markers for high density maps as well as 
      SNP arrays and allowed genome-wide association studies and genomic selection in 
      sunflower. Genome wide or candidate gene based association studies have been 
      performed for traits like branching, flowering time, resistance to Sclerotinia 
      head and stalk rot. First steps in genomic selection with regard to hybrid 
      performance and hybrid oil content have shown that genomic selection can 
      successfully address complex quantitative traits in sunflower and will help to 
      speed up sunflower breeding programs in the future. To make sunflower more 
      competitive toward other oil crops higher levels of resistance against pathogens 
      and better yield performance are required. In addition, optimizing plant 
      architecture toward a more complex growth type for higher plant densities has the 
      potential to considerably increase yields per hectare. Integrative approaches 
      combining omic technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics 
      and phenomics) using bioinformatic tools will facilitate the identification of 
      target genes and markers for complex traits and will give a better insight into 
      the mechanisms behind the traits.

AB  - Sleep is essential for optimal brain functioning and health, but the biological 
      substrates through which sleep delivers these beneficial effects remain largely 
      unknown. We used a systems genetics approach in the BXD genetic reference 
      population (GRP) of mice and assembled a comprehensive experimental knowledge 
      base comprising a deep "sleep-wake" phenome, central and peripheral 
      transcriptomes, and plasma metabolome data, collected under undisturbed baseline 
      conditions and after sleep deprivation (SD). We present analytical tools to 
      interactively interrogate the database, visualize the molecular networks altered 
      by sleep loss, and prioritize candidate genes. We found that a one-time, short 
      disruption of sleep already extensively reshaped the systems genetics landscape 
      by altering 60%-78% of the transcriptomes and the metabolome, with numerous 
      genetic loci affecting the magnitude and direction of change. Systems genetics 
      integrative analyses drawing on all levels of organization imply 
      α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor trafficking 
      and fatty acid turnover as substrates of the negative effects of insufficient 
      sleep. Our analyses demonstrate that genetic heterogeneity and the effects of 
      insufficient sleep itself on the transcriptome and metabolome are far more 
      widespread than previously reported.

TI  - Variation in dental morphology and inference of continental ancestry in admixed 
      Latin Americans.
PG  - 438-447
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.23756 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the variation in dental nonmetric traits and to 
      evaluate the utility of this variation for inferring genetic ancestry proportions 
      in a sample of admixed Latin Americans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We characterized a 
      sample from Colombia (N = 477) for 34 dental traits and obtained estimates of 
      individual Native American, European, and African ancestry using genome-wide SNP 
      data. We tested for correlation between dental traits, genetic ancestry, age, and 
      sex. We carried out a biodistance analysis between the Colombian sample and 
      reference continental population samples using the mean measure of divergence 
      statistic calculated from dental trait frequencies. We evaluated the inference of 
      genetic ancestry from dental traits using a regression approach (with 10-fold 
      cross-validation) as well as by testing the correlation between estimates of 
      ancestry obtained from genetic and dental data. RESULTS: Latin Americans show 
      intermediate dental trait frequencies when compared to Native Americans, 
      Europeans, and Africans. Significant correlations were observed for several 
      dental traits, genetic ancestry, age, and sex. The biodistance analysis displayed 
      a closer relationship of Colombians to Europeans than to Native Americans and 
      Africans. Mean ancestry estimates obtained from the dental data are similar to 
      the genetic estimates (Native American: 32% vs. 28%, European: 59% vs. 63%, and 
      African: 9% vs. 9%, respectively). However, dental features provided low 
      predictive power for genetic ancestry of individuals in both approaches tested 
      (R(2)  < 5% for all genetic ancestries across methods). DISCUSSION: The frequency 
      of dental traits in Latin Americans reflects their admixed Native American, 
      European and African ancestry and can provide reasonable average estimates of 
      genetic ancestry. However, the accuracy of individual genetic ancestry estimates 
      is relatively low, probably influenced by the continental differentiation of 
      dental traits, their genetic architecture, and the distribution of genetic 
      ancestry in the individuals examined.

TI  - Impact of fungicides and weather on cyclodepsipeptide-producing Fusarium spp. and 
      beauvericin and enniatin levels in wheat grains.
PG  - 253-262
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.9167 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a well-known disease of wheat caused by 
      a complex of Fusarium species. In this research, an extensive study on the 
      occurrence of the emerging Fusarium cyclodepsipeptide mycotoxins beauvericin and 
      enniatins was conducted in Belgian wheat grains harvested in 2015 and 2016. To 
      assess the link between Fusarium species and their mycotoxin production, 
      ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to 
      quantify the cyclodepsipeptide mycotoxins, while quantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction was applied to quantify the presence of Fusarium species. RESULTS: It 
      was shown that enniatins were mainly associated with the presence of F. 
      avenaceum, while beauvericin, despite its low incidence, correlated significantly 
      with F. poae. The application of fungicides resulted in a species shift and in 
      the occurring mycotoxins. Concerning the effect of weather conditions, it was 
      seen that levels of enniatins were positively correlated with the rainfall in May 
      and June, while a negative correlation was observed with rainfall in the first 
      half of July. CONCLUSION: Our study provides new insights into the occurrence of 
      the emerging cyclodepsipeptide mycotoxins in an agro-ecosystem in which 
      fungicides are the main control measure against FHB. It seems that beauvericin 
      and enniatin levels are affected by different parameters and behave differently 
      upon application of fungicides. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Protein-truncating variants can have profound effects on gene function and are 
      critical for clinical genome interpretation and generating therapeutic 
      hypotheses, but their relevance to medical phenotypes has not been systematically 
      assessed. Here, we characterize the effect of 18,228 protein-truncating variants 
      across 135 phenotypes from the UK Biobank and find 27 associations between 
      medical phenotypes and protein-truncating variants in genes outside the major 
      histocompatibility complex. We perform phenome-wide analyses and directly measure 
      the effect in homozygous carriers, commonly referred to as "human knockouts," 
      across medical phenotypes for genes implicated as being protective against 
      disease or associated with at least one phenotype in our study. We find several 
      genes with strong pleiotropic or non-additive effects. Our results illustrate the 
      importance of protein-truncating variants in a variety of diseases.

AB  - The growth of multiparametric imaging protocols has paved the way for 
      quantitative imaging phenotypes that predict treatment response and clinical 
      outcome, reflect underlying cancer molecular characteristics and spatiotemporal 
      heterogeneity, and can guide personalized treatment planning. This growth has 
      underlined the need for efficient quantitative analytics to derive 
      high-dimensional imaging signatures of diagnostic and predictive value in this 
      emerging era of integrated precision diagnostics. This paper presents cancer 
      imaging phenomics toolkit (CaPTk), a new and dynamically growing software 
      platform for analysis of radiographic images of cancer, currently focusing on 
      brain, breast, and lung cancer. CaPTk leverages the value of quantitative imaging 
      analytics along with machine learning to derive phenotypic imaging signatures, 
      based on two-level functionality. First, image analysis algorithms are used to 
      extract comprehensive panels of diverse and complementary features, such as 
      multiparametric intensity histogram distributions, texture, shape, kinetics, 
      connectomics, and spatial patterns. At the second level, these quantitative 
      imaging signatures are fed into multivariate machine learning models to produce 
      diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. Results from clinical studies 
      in three areas are shown: (i) computational neuro-oncology of brain gliomas for 
      precision diagnostics, prediction of outcome, and treatment planning; 
      (ii) prediction of treatment response for breast and lung cancer, and (iii) risk 
      assessment for breast cancer.

TI  - Recent Genetics and Epigenetics Approaches to PTSD.
PG  - 30
LID - 10.1007/s11920-018-0898-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Following a life-threatening traumatic exposure, about 10% of 
      those exposed are at considerable risk for developing posttraumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD), a severe and disabling syndrome characterized by uncontrollable 
      intrusive memories, nightmares, avoidance behaviors, and hyperarousal in addition 
      to impaired cognition and negative emotion symptoms. This review will explore 
      recent genetic and epigenetic approaches to PTSD that explain some of the 
      differential risk following trauma exposure. RECENT FINDINGS: A substantial 
      portion of the variance explaining differential risk responses to trauma exposure 
      may be explained by differential inherited and acquired genetic and epigenetic 
      risk. This biological risk is complemented by alterations in the functional 
      regulation of genes via environmentally induced epigenetic changes, including 
      prior childhood and adult trauma exposure. This review will cover recent findings 
      from large-scale genome-wide association studies as well as newer epigenome-wide 
      studies. We will also discuss future "phenome-wide" studies utilizing electronic 
      medical records as well as targeted genetic studies focusing on mechanistic ways 
      in which specific genetic or epigenetic alterations regulate the biological risk 
      for PTSD.

TI  - Rare Variants in the Gene ALPL That Cause Hypophosphatasia Are Strongly 
      Associated With Ovarian and Uterine Disorders.
PG  - 2234-2243
LID - 10.1210/jc.2017-02676 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Mutations in alkaline phosphatase (AlkP), liver/bone/kidney (ALPL), 
      which encodes tissue-nonspecific isozyme AlkP, cause hypophosphatasia (HPP). HPP 
      is suspected by a low-serum AlkP. We hypothesized that some patients with bone or 
      dental disease have undiagnosed HPP, caused by ALPL variants. OBJECTIVE: Our 
      objective was to discover the prevalence of these gene variants in the Vanderbilt 
      University DNA Biobank (BioVU) and to assess phenotypic associations. DESIGN: We 
      identified subjects in BioVU, a repository of DNA, that had at least one of three 
      known, rare HPP disease-causing variants in ALPL: rs199669988, rs121918007, 
      and/or rs121918002. To evaluate for phenotypic associations, we conducted a 
      sequential phenome-wide association study of ALPL variants and then performed a 
      de-identified manual record review to refine the phenotype. RESULTS: Out of 
      25,822 genotyped individuals, we identified 52 women and 53 men with HPP 
      disease-causing variants in ALPL, 7/1000. None had a clinical diagnosis of HPP. 
      For patients with ALPL variants, the average serum AlkP levels were in the lower 
      range of normal or lower. Forty percent of men and 62% of women had documented 
      bone and/or dental disease, compatible with the diagnosis of HPP. Forty percent 
      of the female patients had ovarian pathology or other gynecological abnormalities 
      compared with 15% seen in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Variants in the ALPL gene cause 
      bone and dental disease in patients with and without the standard biomarker, low 
      plasma AlkP. ALPL gene variants are more prevalent than currently reported and 
      underdiagnosed. Gynecologic disease appears to be associated with HPP-causing 
      variants in ALPL.

TI  - Combining High-Throughput Phenotyping and Genomic Information to Increase 
      Prediction and Selection Accuracy in Wheat Breeding.
LID - 10.3835/plantgenome2017.05.0043 [doi]
AB  - Genomics and phenomics have promised to revolutionize the field of plant 
      breeding. The integration of these two fields has just begun and is being driven 
      through big data by advances in next-generation sequencing and developments of 
      field-based high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms. Each year the 
      International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) evaluates 
      tens-of-thousands of advanced lines for grain yield across multiple environments. 
      To evaluate how CIMMYT may utilize dynamic HTP data for genomic selection (GS), 
      we evaluated 1170 of these advanced lines in two environments, drought (2014, 
      2015) and heat (2015). A portable phenotyping system called 'Phenocart' was used 
      to measure normalized difference vegetation index and canopy temperature 
      simultaneously while tagging each data point with precise GPS coordinates. For 
      genomic profiling, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) was used for marker discovery 
      and genotyping. Several GS models were evaluated utilizing the 2254 GBS markers 
      along with over 1.1 million phenotypic observations. The physiological 
      measurements collected by HTP, whether used as a response in multivariate models 
      or as a covariate in univariate models, resulted in a range of 33% below to 7% 
      above the standard univariate model. Continued advances in yield prediction 
      models as well as increasing data generating capabilities for both genomic and 
      phenomic data will make these selection strategies tractable for plant breeders 
      to implement increasing the rate of genetic gain.

TI  - The Planteome database: an integrated resource for reference ontologies, plant 
      genomics and phenomics.
PG  - D1168-D1180
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkx1152 [doi]
AB  - The Planteome project (http://www.planteome.org) provides a suite of reference 
      and species-specific ontologies for plants and annotations to genes and 
      phenotypes. Ontologies serve as common standards for semantic integration of a 
      large and growing corpus of plant genomics, phenomics and genetics data. The 
      reference ontologies include the Plant Ontology, Plant Trait Ontology and the 
      Plant Experimental Conditions Ontology developed by the Planteome project, along 
      with the Gene Ontology, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, Phenotype and 
      Attribute Ontology, and others. The project also provides access to 
      species-specific Crop Ontologies developed by various plant breeding and research

TI  - Barley lys3 mutants are unique amongst shrunken-endosperm mutants in having 
      abnormally large embryos.

AB  - Many shrunken endosperm mutants of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) have been 
      described and several of these are known to have lesions in starch biosynthesis 
      genes. Here we confirm that one type of shrunken endosperm mutant, lys3 (so 
      called because it was first identified as a high-lysine mutant) has an additional 
      phenotype: as well as shrunken endosperm it also has enlarged embryos. The lys3 
      embryos have a dry weight that is 50-150% larger than normal. Observations of 
      developing lys3 embryos suggest that they undergo a form of premature germination 
      and the mature lys3 grains show reduced dormancy. In many respects, the phenotype 
      of barley lys3 is similar to that of rice GIANT EMBRYO mutants (affected in the 
      OsGE gene). However, the barley orthologue of OsGE is located on a different 
      chromosome from Lys3. Together these results suggest that the gene underlying 
      Lys3 is unlikely to encode a starch biosynthesis protein but rather a protein 
      influencing grain development.

AB  - Recent improvements in high-throughput proteomic approaches are likely to 
      constitute an essential advance in biomarker discovery, holding promise for 
      improved personalized care and drug development. These methodologies have been 
      applied to study multivariate protein patterns and provide valuable data of 
      peripheral tissues. To highlight findings of the last decade for three of the 
      most common psychiatric disorders, namely schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder 
      (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), we queried PubMed. Here we delve into 
      the findings from thirty studies, which used proteomics and multiplex immunoassay 
      approaches for peripheral blood biomarker exploration. In an explorative 
      approach, we ran enrichment analyses in peripheral blood according to these 
      results and ascertained the overlap between proteomic findings and genetic loci 
      identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The studies we appraised 
      demonstrate that proteomics for psychiatric research has been heterogeneous in 
      aims and methods and limited by insufficient sample sizes, poorly defined case 
      definitions, methodological inhomogeneity, and confounding results constraining 
      the conclusions that can be extracted from them. Here, we discuss possibilities 
      for overcoming methodological challenges for the implementation of proteomic 
      signatures in psychiatric diagnosis and offer an outlook for future 
      investigations. To fulfill the promise of proteomics in mental disease 
      diagnostics, future research will need large, well-defined cohorts in combination 
      with state-of-the-art technologies.

TI  - High-throughput chlorophyll fluorescence screening of Setaria viridis for mutants 
      with altered CO(2) compensation points.
PG  - 1017-1025
LID - 10.1071/FP17322 [doi]
AB  - To assist with efforts to engineer a C4 photosynthetic pathway into rice, 
      forward-genetic approaches are being used to identify the genes modulating key C4 
      traits. Currently, a major challenge is how to screen for a variety of different 
      traits in a high-throughput manner. Here we describe a method for identifying C4 
      mutant plants with increased CO2 compensation points. This is used as a signature 
      for decreased photosynthetic efficiency associated with a loss of C4 function. By 
      exposing plants to a CO2 concentration close to the CO2 compensation point of a 
      wild-type plant, individuals can be identified from measurements of chlorophyll a 
      fluorescence. We use this method to screen a mutant population of the C4 monocot 
      Setaria viridis (L.)P.Beauv. generated using N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU). 
      Mutants were identified at a frequency of 1 per 157 lines screened. Forty-six 
      candidate lines were identified and one line with a heritable homozygous 
      phenotype selected for further characterisation. The CO2 compensation point of 
      this mutant was increased to a value similar to that of C3 rice. Photosynthesis 
      and growth was significantly reduced under ambient conditions. These data 
      indicate that the screen was capable of identifying mutants with decreased 
      photosynthetic efficiency. Characterisation and next-generation sequencing of all 
      the mutants identified in this screen may lead to the discovery of novel genes 
      underpinning C4 photosynthesis. These can be used to engineer a C4 photosynthetic 
      pathway into rice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the effect of human genetic variations on disease can 
      provide insight into phenotype-genotype relationships, and has great potential 
      for improving the effectiveness of personalized medicine. While some genetic 
      markers linked to disease susceptibility have been identified, a large number are 
      still unknown. In this paper, we propose a pathway-based approach to extend 
      disease-variant associations and find new molecular connections between genetic 
      mutations and diseases. METHODS: We used a compilation of over 80,000 human 
      genetic variants with known disease associations from databases including the 
      Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Clinical Variance database (ClinVar), 
      Universal Protein Resource (UniProt), and Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). 
      Furthermore, we used the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to normalize 
      variant phenotype terminologies, mapping 87% of unique genetic variants to 
      phenotypic disorder concepts. Lastly, variants were grouped by UMLS Medical 
      Subject Heading (MeSH) identifiers to determine pathway enrichment in Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. RESULTS: By linking KEGG 
      pathways through underlying variant associations, we elucidated connections 
      between the human genetic variant-based disease phenome and metabolic pathways, 
      finding novel disease connections not otherwise detected through gene-level 
      analysis. When looking at broader disease categories, our network analysis showed 
      that large complex diseases, such as cancers, are highly linked by their common 
      pathways. In addition, we found Cardiovascular Diseases and Skin and Connective 
      Tissue Diseases to have the highest number of common pathways, among 35 
      significant main disease category (MeSH) pairings. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      constitutes an important contribution to extending disease-variant connections 
      and new molecular links between diseases. Novel disease connections were made by 
      disease-pathway associations not otherwise detected through single-gene analysis. 
      For instance, we found that mutations in different genes associated to Noonan 
      Syndrome and Essential Hypertension share a common pathway. This analysis also 
      provides the foundation to build novel disease-drug networks through their 
      underlying common metabolic pathways, thus enabling new diagnostic and 
      therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Celecoxib enhances the therapeutic efficacy of epirubicin for Novikoff hepatoma 
      in rats.

AB  - Epirubicin is a chemotherapy agent for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, 
      the outcome of HCC patients receiving epirubicin remains unsatisfactory. 
      Moreover, our previous study indicated that celecoxib suppresses HCC progression 
      and liver cancer stemness. This study evaluated the potential of celecoxib to 
      serve as a complementary therapy during epirubicin treatment. Cell proliferation, 
      apoptosis, invasiveness, and anchorage-independent growth were analyzed in 
      hepatoma cells. Therapeutic efficacy was validated in rat orthotopic Novikoff 
      hepatoma. After animal sacrifice, the antitumor mechanism of celecoxib and 
      epirubicin combined therapy was investigated by histological analysis. Celecoxib 
      enhanced the cytotoxic activity of epirubicin in HCC cells by promoting 
      apoptosis. Besides, celecoxib potentiated the antineoplastic function of 
      epirubicin in inhibiting the invasiveness and anchorage-independent growth of HCC 
      cells. Ultrasound monitoring showed that combined therapy was more potent than 
      either therapy alone in perturbing HCC progression. Consistently, the size and 
      weight of dissected HCC tissues from rats receiving combined therapy were 
      smallest among all groups. HCC treated with combined therapy exhibited the 
      highest prevalence of apoptotic cells, which was accompanied by reduced 
      proliferating and angiogenic activities in tumor tissues. Moreover, the 
      expression levels of cancer stemness markers (CD44 and CD133) and drug 
      transporter MDR-1 were significantly diminished in rats receiving combined 
      therapy. Besides, celecoxib treatment increased the infiltration of cytotoxic T 
      lymphocytes (CTLs) and reduced the number of regulatory T cells (Tregs), 
      tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and the expression of immune checkpoint 
      PD-L1 in HCC tissues during epirubicin therapy. Celecoxib augmented the 
      therapeutic efficacy while modulated cancer stemness and antitumor immunity. 
      Thus, celecoxib may serve as complementary therapy to improve the outcome of 
      patients with advanced HCC during epirubicin treatment.

TI  - Nicotinamide Nucleotide Transhydrogenase as a Novel Treatment Target in 
      Adrenocortical Carcinoma.
PG  - 2836-2849
LID - 10.1210/en.2018-00014 [doi]
AB  - Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor response to 
      chemotherapy. In this study, we evaluated a potential new treatment target for 
      ACC, focusing on the mitochondrial reduced form of NAD phosphate (NADPH) 
      generator nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT). NNT has a central role 
      within mitochondrial antioxidant pathways, protecting cells from oxidative 
      stress. Inactivating human NNT mutations result in congenital adrenal 
      insufficiency. We hypothesized that NNT silencing in ACC cells will induce toxic 
      levels of oxidative stress. To explore this, we transiently knocked down NNT in 
      NCI-H295R ACC cells. As predicted, this manipulation increased intracellular 
      levels of oxidative stress; this resulted in a pronounced suppression of cell 
      proliferation and higher apoptotic rates, as well as sensitization of cells to 
      chemically induced oxidative stress. Steroidogenesis was paradoxically stimulated 
      by NNT loss, as demonstrated by mass spectrometry-based steroid profiling. Next, 
      we generated a stable NNT knockdown model in the same cell line to investigate 
      the longer lasting effects of NNT silencing. After long-term culture, cells 
      adapted metabolically to chronic NNT knockdown, restoring their redox balance and 
      resilience to oxidative stress, although their proliferation remained suppressed. 
      This was associated with higher rates of oxygen consumption. The molecular 
      pathways underpinning these responses were explored in detail by RNA sequencing 
      and nontargeted metabolome analysis, revealing major alterations in nucleotide 
      synthesis, protein folding, and polyamine metabolism. This study provides 
      preclinical evidence of the therapeutic merit of antioxidant targeting in ACC as 
      well as illuminating the long-term adaptive response of cells to oxidative 
      stress.

TI  - Land-based crop phenotyping by image analysis: consistent canopy characterization 
      from inconsistent field illumination.
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1186/s13007-018-0308-5 [doi]
LID - 39
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the main challenges associated with image-based field 
      phenotyping is the variability of illumination. During a single day's imaging 
      session, or between different sessions on different days, the sun moves in and 
      out of cloud cover and has varying intensity. How is one to know from consecutive 
      images alone if a plant has become darker over time, or if the weather conditions 
      have simply changed from clear to overcast? This is a significant problem to 
      address as colour is an important phenotypic trait that can be measured 
      automatically from images. RESULTS: In this work we use an industry standard 
      colour checker to balance the colour in images within and across every day of a 
      field trial conducted over four months in 2016. By ensuring that the colour 
      checker is present in every image we are afforded a 'ground truth' to correct for 
      varying illumination conditions across images. We employ a least squares approach 
      to fit a quadratic model for correcting RGB values of an image in such a way that 
      the observed values of the colour checker tiles align with their true values 
      after the transformation. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is successful in 
      reducing the error between observed and reference colour chart values in all 
      images. Furthermore, the standard deviation of mean canopy colour across multiple 
      days is reduced significantly after colour correction is applied. Finally, we use 
      a number of examples to demonstrate the usefulness of accurate colour 
      measurements in recording phenotypic traits and analysing variation among 
      varieties and treatments.

TI  - Evaluating statistical approaches to leverage large clinical datasets for 
      uncovering therapeutic and adverse medication effects.
PG  - 2988-2996
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty306 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) have been used to discover 
      many genotype-phenotype relationships and have the potential to identify 
      therapeutic and adverse drug outcomes using longitudinal data within electronic 
      health records (EHRs). However, the statistical methods for PheWAS applied to 
      longitudinal EHR medication data have not been established. RESULTS: In this 
      study, we developed methods to address two challenges faced with reuse of EHR for 
      this purpose: confounding by indication, and low exposure and event rates. We 
      used Monte Carlo simulation to assess propensity score (PS) methods, focusing on 
      two of the most commonly used methods, PS matching and PS adjustment, to address 
      confounding by indication. We also compared two logistic regression approaches 
      (the default of Wald versus Firth's penalized maximum likelihood, PML) to address 
      complete separation due to sparse data with low exposure and event rates. PS 
      adjustment resulted in greater power than PS matching, while controlling Type I 
      error at 0.05. The PML method provided reasonable P-values, even in cases with 
      complete separation, with well controlled Type I error rates. Using PS adjustment 
      and the PML method, we identify novel latent drug effects in pediatric patients 
      exposed to two common antibiotic drugs, ampicillin and gentamicin. AVAILABILITY 
      AND IMPLEMENTATION: R packages PheWAS and EHR are available at 
      https://github.com/PheWAS/PheWAS and at CRAN (https://www.r-project.org/), 
      respectively. The R script for data processing and the main analysis is available 
      at https://github.com/choileena/EHR. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary 
      data are available at Bioinformatics online.

TI  - Cardiomyocyte-Restricted Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 6 
      (LRP6) Deletion Leads to Lethal Dilated Cardiomyopathy Partly Through Drp1 
      Signaling.
PG  - 627-643
LID - 10.7150/thno.22177 [doi]
AB  - Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), a wnt co-receptor, 
      regulates multiple functions in various organs. However, the roles of LRP6 in the 
      adult heart are not well understood. Methods: We observed LRP6 expression in 
      heart with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) by western blot. 
      Tamoxifen-inducible cardiac-specific LRP6 knockout mouse was constructed. 
      Hemodynamic and echocardiographic analyses were performed to these mice. Results: 
      Cardiac LRP6 expression was dramatically decreased in patients with end-stage 
      dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) compared to control group. Tamoxifen-inducible 
      cardiac-specific LRP6 knockout mice developed acute heart failure and 
      mitochondrial dysfunction with reduced survival. Proteomic analysis suggests the 
      fatty acid metabolism disorder involving peroxisome proliferator-activated 
      receptors (PPARs) signaling in the LRP6 deficient heart. Accumulation of 
      mitochondrial targeting to autophagosomes and lipid droplet were observed in LRP6 
      deletion hearts. Further analysis revealed cardiac LRP6 deletion suppressed 
      autophagic degradation and fatty acid utilization, coinciding with activation of 
      dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and downregulation of nuclear TFEB 
      (Transcription factor EB). Injection of Mdivi-1, a Drp1 inhibitor, not only 
      promoted nuclear translocation of TFEB, but also partially rescued autophagic 
      degradation, improved PPARs signaling, and attenuated cardiac dysfunction induced 
      by cardiac specific LRP6 deletion. Conclusions: Cardiac LRP6 deficiency greatly 
      suppressed autophagic degradation and fatty acid utilization, and subsequently 
      leads to lethal dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac dysfunction through activation 
      of Drp1 signaling. It suggests that heart failure progression may be attenuated 
      by therapeutic modulation of LRP6 expression.

TI  - Interaction patterns of trauma providers are associated with length of stay.
PG  - 790-799
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocy009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trauma-related hospitalizations drive a high percentage of health 
      care expenditure and inpatient resource consumption, which is directly related to 
      length of stay (LOS). Robust and reliable interactions among health care 
      employees can reduce LOS. However, there is little known about whether certain 
      patterns of interactions exist and how they relate to LOS and its variability. 
      The objective of this study is to learn interaction patterns and quantify the 
      relationship to LOS within a mature trauma system and long-standing electronic 
      medical record (EMR). METHODS: We adapted a spectral co-clustering methodology to 
      infer the interaction patterns of health care employees based on the EMR of 5588 
      hospitalized adult trauma survivors. The relationship between interaction 
      patterns and LOS was assessed via a negative binomial regression model. We 
      further assessed the influence of potential confounders by age, number of health 
      care encounters to date, number of access action types care providers committed 
      to patient EMRs, month of admission, phenome-wide association study codes, 
      procedure codes, and insurance status. RESULTS: Three types of interaction 
      patterns were discovered. The first pattern exhibited the most collaboration 
      between employees and was associated with the shortest LOS. Compared to this 
      pattern, LOS for the second and third patterns was 0.61 days (P = 0.014) and 0.43 
      days (P = 0.037) longer, respectively. Although the 3 interaction patterns dealt 
      with different numbers of patients in each admission month, our results suggest 
      that care was provided for similar patients. DISCUSSION: The results of this 
      study indicate there is an association between LOS and the extent to which health 
      care employees interact in the care of an injured patient. The findings further 
      suggest that there is merit in ascertaining the content of these interactions and 
      the factors that induce these differences in interaction patterns within a trauma 
      system.

TI  - Dietary Leucine Supplement Ameliorates Hepatic Steatosis and Diabetic Nephropathy 
      in db/db Mice.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19071921 [doi]
LID - 1921
AB  - Dietary leucine supplementation has been explored for the therapeutic 
      intervention of obesity and obesity-induced metabolic dysfunctions. In this 
      study, we aim to examine the effects of dietary leucine supplementation in db/db 
      mice. Mice were treated with or without leucine (1.5% w/v) in drinking water for 
      12 weeks. The leucine supplement was found to reduce insulin resistance and 
      hepatic steatosis in db/db mice. Using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)-based 
      lipidomics, we found that the reduction of hepatic triglyceride synthesis was 
      correlated with attenuated development of fatty liver. In addition, diabetic 
      nephropathy (DN) was also ameliorated by leucine. Using liquid 
      chromatography⁻time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF MS)-based urine 
      metabolomics analysis, we found that the disturbance of the tricarboxylic acid 
      (TCA) cycle was reversed by leucine. The beneficial effects of leucine were 
      probably due to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in the liver and 
      kidneys of db/db mice. Thus, dietary leucine supplementation may potentially be a 
      nutritional intervention to attenuate hepatic steatosis and early DN in type II 
      diabetes.

AB  - Fusarium head blight disease resulting from Fusarium graminearum (FG) infection 
      causes huge losses in global production of cereals and development of 
      FG-resistant plants is urgently needed. To understand biochemistry mechanisms for 
      FG resistance, here, we have systematically investigated the plant metabolomic 
      phenotypes associated with FG resistance for transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana 
      expressing a class-I chitinase (Chi), a Fusarium-specific recombinant antibody 
      gene (CWP2) and fused Chi-CWP2. Plant disease indices, mycotoxin levels, 
      metabonomic characteristics, and expression levels of several key genes were 
      measured together with their correlations. We found that A. thaliana expressing 
      Chi-CWP2 showed higher FG resistance with much lower disease indices and 
      mycotoxin levels than the wild-type and the plants expressing Chi or CWP2 alone. 
      The combined metabonomic and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that such 
      FG-resistance was closely associated with the promoted biosynthesis of secondary 
      metabolites (phenylpropanoids, alkanoids) and organic osmolytes (proline, 
      betaine, glucose, myo-inositol) together with enhanced TCA cycle and GABA shunt. 
      These suggest that the concurrently enhanced biosyntheses of the 
      shikimate-mediated secondary metabolites and organic osmolytes be an important 
      strategy for A. thaliana to develop and improve FG resistance. These findings 
      provide essential biochemical information related to FG resistance which is 
      important for developing FG-resistant cereals.

AB  - The wave of high-throughput technologies in genomics and phenomics are enabling 
      data to be generated on an unprecedented scale and at a reasonable cost. 
      Exploring the large-scale data sets generated by these technologies to derive 
      biological insights requires efficient bioinformatic tools. Here we introduce an 
      interactive, open-source web application (HTPmod) for high-throughput biological 
      data modeling and visualization. HTPmod is implemented with the Shiny framework 
      by integrating the computational power and professional visualization of R and 
      including various machine-learning approaches. We demonstrate that HTPmod can be 
      used for modeling and visualizing large-scale, high-dimensional data sets (such 
      as multiple omics data) under a broad context. By reinvestigating example data 
      sets from recent studies, we find not only that HTPmod can reproduce results from 
      the original studies in a straightforward fashion and within a reasonable time, 
      but also that novel insights may be gained from fast reinvestigation of existing 
      data by HTPmod.

AB  - BACKGROUND: How hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated lipid metabolic alterations 
      recover after sustained virological response (SVR) remains elusive. OBJECTIVE: 
      The aforementioned recovery pattern was investigated. METHODS: In a prospective 
      cohort study of 438 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with SVR after anti-HCV 
      therapy, 164 sex- and age-matched genotype I (G1) and G2 patients underwent 
      paired-serum liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses before and 
      24 weeks after therapy. Subjects without CHC served as controls (n = 100). 
      RESULTS: CHC patients had lower baseline lipid levels than controls. Among CHC 
      patients, pre-therapy total cholesterol levels were positively associated with 
      HCV RNA levels; G1 patients had higher pre-therapy HCV RNA levels than G2 
      patients. Repeated measures analysis of variance of CHC patients showed that 
      lathosterol, lanosterol, total hydroxysphingomyelin, and total 
      phosphatidylcholines levels, and total dicarboxyacylcarnitine/total acylcarnitine 
      (indicators of ω-oxidation) and pre-β-lipoprotein ratios elevated 24 weeks after 
      therapy compared with the levels before therapy. Levels of total 
      lysophosphatidylcholines and α- and β-lipoprotein ratios decreased. Subgroup 
      analyses showed elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol and lanosterol levels, particularly 
      in G2 and male patients, who had broader spectra of altered phosphatidylcholines 
      and acylcarnitines than G1 and female patients, respectively. Compared with 
      controls, CHC patients had higher post-therapy levels of total 
      lysophosphatidylcholines and hydroxysphingomyelins and ratios of total 
      dicarboxyacylcarnitines/total acylcarnitines but lower cholesterol levels. 
      CONCLUSIONS: At 24 weeks after therapy, accelerated cholesterol biosynthesis, 
      hepatic lipid export, ω-oxidation, and decreased systemic inflammation were noted 
      in CHC patients with SVR, with greater efficiency in G2 and male patients. 
      Regardless, HCV-associated lipid metabolic alterations required >24 weeks for 
      restoration or were incompletely reversible after SVR.

AB  - The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains to be elucidated. 
      Metabolomic analysis has the potential to identify biochemical pathways and 
      metabolic profiles that are involved in PD pathogenesis. Here, we performed a 
      targeted metabolomics to quantify the plasma levels of 184 metabolites in a 
      discovery cohort including 82 PD patients and 82 normal controls (NCs) and found 
      two up-regulated (dopamine, putrescine/ornithine ratio) and four down-regulated 
      (octadecadienylcarnitine C18:2, asymmetric dimethylarginine, tryptophan, and 
      kynurenine (KYN)) metabolites in the plasma of PD patients. We then measured the 
      plasma levels of a panel of metabolic products of KYN pathway in an independent 
      validation cohort including 118 PD patients, 22 Huntington's disease (HD) 
      patients, and 37 NCs. Lower kynurenic acid (KA)/KYN ratio, higher quinolinic acid 
      (QA) level, and QA/KA ratio were observed in PD patients compared to HD patients 
      and NCs. PD patients at advanced stage (Hoehn-Yahr stage > 2) showed lower KA and 
      KA/KYN ratio, as well as higher QA and QA/KA ratio compared to PD patients at 
      early stage (Hoehn-Yahr stage ≤ 2) and NCs. Levels of KA and QA, as well as the 
      ratios of KA/KYN and QA/KA between PD patients with and without psychiatric 
      symptoms, dementia, or levodopa-induced dyskinesia in the advanced PD were 
      similar. This metabolomic analyses demonstrate a number of plasma biomarker 
      candidates for PD, suggesting a shift toward neurotoxic QA synthesis and away 
      from neuroprotective KA production in KYN pathway.

TI  - The protocadherin 17 gene affects cognition, personality, amygdala structure and 
      function, synapse development and risk of major mood disorders.
PG  - 400-412
LID - 10.1038/mp.2016.231 [doi]
AB  - Major mood disorders, which primarily include bipolar disorder and major 
      depressive disorder, are the leading cause of disability worldwide and pose a 
      major challenge in identifying robust risk genes. Here, we present data from 
      independent large-scale clinical data sets (including 29 557 cases and 32 056 
      controls) revealing brain expressed protocadherin 17 (PCDH17) as a susceptibility 
      gene for major mood disorders. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning 
      the PCDH17 region are significantly associated with major mood disorders; 
      subjects carrying the risk allele showed impaired cognitive abilities, increased 
      vulnerable personality features, decreased amygdala volume and altered amygdala 
      function as compared with non-carriers. The risk allele predicted higher 
      transcriptional levels of PCDH17 mRNA in postmortem brain samples, which is 
      consistent with increased gene expression in patients with bipolar disorder 
      compared with healthy subjects. Further, overexpression of PCDH17 in primary 
      cortical neurons revealed significantly decreased spine density and abnormal 
      dendritic morphology compared with control groups, which again is consistent with 
      the clinical observations of reduced numbers of dendritic spines in the brains of 
      patients with major mood disorders. Given that synaptic spines are dynamic 
      structures which regulate neuronal plasticity and have crucial roles in myriad 
      brain functions, this study reveals a potential underlying biological mechanism 
      of a novel risk gene for major mood disorders involved in synaptic function and 
      related intermediate phenotypes.

TI  - Electronic Medical Record Context Signatures Improve Diagnostic Classification 
      Using Medical Image Computing.
PG  - 2052-2062

AB  - Composite models that combine medical imaging with electronic medical records 
      (EMR) improve predictive power when compared to traditional models that use 
      imaging alone. The digitization of EMR provides potential access to a wealth of 
      medical information, but presents new challenges in algorithm design and 
      inference. Previous studies, such as Phenome Wide Association Study (PheWAS), 
      have shown that EMR data can be used to investigate the relationship between 
      genotypes and clinical conditions. Here, we introduce Phenome-Disease Association 
      Study to extend the statistical capabilities of the PheWAS software through a 
      custom Python package, which creates diagnostic EMR signatures to capture 
      system-wide co-morbidities for a disease population within a given time interval. 
      We investigate the effect of integrating these EMR signatures with radiological 
      data to improve diagnostic classification in disease domains known to have 
      confounding factors because of variable and complex clinical presentation. 
      Specifically, we focus on two studies: First, a study of four major optic nerve 
      related conditions; and second, a study of diabetes. Addition of EMR signature 
      vectors to radiologically derived structural metrics improves the area under the 
      curve (AUC) for diagnostic classification using elastic net regression, for 
      diseases of the optic nerve. For glaucoma, the AUC improves from 0.71 to 0.83, 
      for intrinsic optic nerve disease it increases from 0.72 to 0.91, for optic nerve 
      edema it increases from 0.95 to 0.96, and for thyroid eye disease from 0.79 to 
      0.89. The EMR signatures recapitulate known comorbidities with diabetes, such as 
      abnormal glucose, but do not significantly modulate image-derived features. In 
      summary, EMR signatures present a scalable and readily applicable.

TI  - Latin Americans show wide-spread Converso ancestry and imprint of local Native 
      ancestry on physical appearance.
PG  - 5388
LID - 10.1038/s41467-018-07748-z [doi]
LID - 5388
AB  - Historical records and genetic analyses indicate that Latin Americans trace their 
      ancestry mainly to the intermixing (admixture) of Native Americans, Europeans and 
      Sub-Saharan Africans. Using novel haplotype-based methods, here we infer 
      sub-continental ancestry in over 6,500 Latin Americans and evaluate the impact of 
      regional ancestry variation on physical appearance. We find that Native American 
      ancestry components in Latin Americans correspond geographically to the 
      present-day genetic structure of Native groups, and that sources of non-Native 
      ancestry, and admixture timings, match documented migratory flows. We also detect 
      South/East Mediterranean ancestry across Latin America, probably stemming mostly 
      from the clandestine colonial migration of Christian converts of non-European 
      origin (Conversos). Furthermore, we find that ancestry related to highland 
      (Central Andean) versus lowland (Mapuche) Natives is associated with variation in 
      facial features, particularly nose morphology, and detect significant differences 
      in allele frequencies between these groups at loci previously associated with 
      nose morphology in this sample.

AB  - Quantification of neuro-behavioural responses of intact small model organisms has 
      been proposed as a sensitive, sub-lethal alternative to conventional toxicity 
      testing. Such bioassays are characterized by a high physiological and ecological 
      relevance, short response times, increased sensitivity, and non-invasive nature. 
      Despite a significant potential for predictive aquatic toxicology analysis of 
      behavioural traits of micro-invertebrates in microfluidic environment has 
      received little attention. In this work, we demonstrate a new Lab-on-a-Chip 
      technology capable of effectively caging freshwater rotifers Brachionus 
      calyciflorus for real-time video-microscopy analysis. We demonstrate that 
      behavioural bioassays performed under microfluidic perfusion can significantly 
      enhance the sensitivity of conventional ecotoxicology test protocols.

AB  - An increased interest in implementations of Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) technologies for 
      in-situ analysis of multicellular metazoan model organisms and their embryonic 
      stages demands development of new prototyping techniques. Due to size of 
      multicellular organisms the fabrication of soft-lithography molds requires 
      features with high aspect ratios as well as deposition of layers with significant 
      thicknesses. This makes them time consuming and difficult to fabricate using 
      conventional photolithography techniques. In this work we describe development of 
      a rapid technique capable of generating thick films achieved with high viscosity 
      SU-8 and used in fabricating master templates for high aspect ratio micro- and 
      mesofluidic devices. The cost effective and rapid method eliminated the need for 
      multiple spin coating cycles as well as edge bead artifacts while preserving low 
      surface roughness and superior surface uniformity. Due to elimination of spin 
      coating steps, typically constrained to clean room facilities, the new method 
      allows to significantly reduce microfabrication costs. We have utilized the 
      prototyping technique to develop proof-of-concept chip-based devices capable of 
      effectively caging freshwater rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus for 
      high-definition video-microscopy analysis. The combination of time-resolved 
      video-microscopy and chip-based physiometers enabled us to demonstrate new 
      applications for neurobehavioral assays utilizing non-invasive sub-lethal 
      end-points.

TI  - Utilizing random regression models for genomic prediction of a longitudinal trait 
      derived from high-throughput phenotyping.
PG  - e00080
LID - 10.1002/pld3.80 [doi]
LID - e00080
AB  - The accessibility of high-throughput phenotyping platforms in both the greenhouse 
      and field, as well as the relatively low cost of unmanned aerial vehicles, has 
      provided researchers with an effective means to characterize large populations 
      throughout the growing season. These longitudinal phenotypes can provide 
      important insight into plant development and responses to the environment. 
      Despite the growing use of these new phenotyping approaches in plant breeding, 
      the use of genomic prediction models for longitudinal phenotypes is limited in 
      major crop species. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the utility of 
      random regression (RR) models using Legendre polynomials for genomic prediction 
      of shoot growth trajectories in rice (Oryza sativa). An estimate of shoot 
      biomass, projected shoot area (PSA), was recorded over a period of 20 days for a 
      panel of 357 diverse rice accessions using an image-based greenhouse phenotyping 
      platform. A RR that included a fixed second-order Legendre polynomial, a random 
      second-order Legendre polynomial for the additive genetic effect, a first-order 
      Legendre polynomial for the environmental effect, and heterogeneous residual 
      variances was used to model PSA trajectories. The utility of the RR model over a 
      single time point (TP) approach, where PSA is fit at each time point 
      independently, is shown through four prediction scenarios. In the first scenario, 
      the RR and TP approaches were used to predict PSA for a set of lines lacking 
      phenotypic data. The RR approach showed a 11.6% increase in prediction accuracy 
      over the TP approach. Much of this improvement could be attributed to the greater 
      additive genetic variance captured by the RR approach. The remaining scenarios 
      focused forecasting future phenotypes using a subset of early time points for 
      known lines with phenotypic data, as well new lines lacking phenotypic data. In 
      all cases, PSA could be predicted with high accuracy (r: 0.79 to 0.89 and 0.55 to 
      0.58 for known and unknown lines, respectively). This study provides the first 
      application of RR models for genomic prediction of a longitudinal trait in rice 
      and demonstrates that RR models can be effectively used to improve the accuracy 
      of genomic prediction for complex traits compared to a TP approach.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis and prognostic stratification are based on 
      histopathologic assessment of cell or nuclear pleomorphism, aberrant mitotic 
      figures, altered glandular architecture, and other phenomic abnormalities. This 
      complexity is driven by oncogenic perturbation of tightly coordinated 
      spatiotemporal signaling to disrupt multiple scales of tissue organization. This 
      review clarifies molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying common CRC 
      histologic features and helps understand how the CRC genome controls core aspects 
      of tumor aggressiveness. It further explores a spatiotemporal framework for CRC 
      phenomics based on regulation of living cells in fundamental and organotypic 
      model systems. The review also discusses tissue homeostasis, considers distinct 
      classes of oncogenic perturbations, and evolution of cellular or multicellular 
      cancer phenotypes. It further explores the molecular controls of cribriform, 
      micropapillary, and high-grade CRC morphology in organotypic culture models and 
      assesses relevant translational studies. In addition, the review delves into 
      complexities of morphologic plasticity whereby a single molecular signature 
      generates heterogeneous cancer phenotypes, and, conversely, morphologically 
      homogeneous tumors show substantive molecular diversity. Principles outlined may 
      aid mechanistic interpretation of omics data in a setting of cancer pathology, 
      provide insight into CRC consensus molecular subtypes, and better define 
      principles for CRC prognostic stratification.

AB  - In crop genetic studies, the mapping of longitudinal data describing the 
      spatio-temporal nature of agronomic traits can elucidate the factors influencing 
      their formation and development. Here, we combine the mapping power and precision 
      of a MAGIC wheat population with robust computational methods to track the 
      spatio- temporal dynamics of traits associated with wheat performance. NIAB MAGIC 
      lines were phenotyped throughout their lifecycle under smart house conditions. 
      Growth models were fitted to the data describing growth trajectories of plant 
      area, height, water use and senescence and fitted parameters were mapped as 
      quantitative traits. Trait data from single time points were also mapped to 
      determine when and how markers became and ceased to be significant. Assessment of 
      temporal dynamics allowed the identification of marker-trait associations and 
      tracking of trait development against the genetic contribution of key markers. We 
      establish a data-driven approach for understanding complex agronomic traits and 
      accelerate research in plant breeding.

AB  - Stress is a well-known cause of reproductive dysfunction in many species, 
      including birds, rodents, and humans, though males and females may respond 
      differently. A powerful way to investigate how stress affects reproduction is by 
      examining its effects on a biological system essential for regulating 
      reproduction, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Often this is done 
      by observing how a stressor affects the amount of glucocorticoids, such as 
      cortisol or corticosterone, circulating in the blood and their relationship with 
      a handful of known HPG-producing reproductive hormones, like testosterone and 
      estradiol. Until now, we have lacked a full understanding of how stress affects 
      all genomic activity of the HPG axis and how this might differ between the sexes. 
      We leveraged a highly replicated and sex-balanced experimental approach to test 
      how male and female rock doves (Columba livia) respond to restraint stress at the 
      level of their transcriptome. Females exhibit increased genomic responsiveness to 
      stress at all levels of their HPG axis as compared to males, and these responsive 
      genes are mostly unique to females. Reasons for this may be due to fluctuations 
      in the female endocrine environment over the reproductive cycle and/or their 
      evolutionary history, including parental investment and the potential for 
      maternal effects. Direct links between genome to phenome cause and effect cannot 
      be ascertained at this stage; however, the data we report provide a vital genomic 
      foundation on which sex-specific reproductive dysfunction and adaptation in the 
      face of stress can be further experimentally studied, as well as novel gene 
      targets for genetic intervention and therapy investigations.

TI  - Association of Interleukin 6 Receptor Variant With Cardiovascular Disease Effects 
      of Interleukin 6 Receptor Blocking Therapy: A Phenome-Wide Association Study.
PG  - 849-857
LID - 10.1001/jamacardio.2018.2287 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Electronic health record (EHR) biobanks containing clinical and 
      genomic data on large numbers of individuals have great potential to inform drug 
      discovery. Individuals with interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) who are not receiving IL6R blocking therapy have biomarker 
      profiles similar to those treated with IL6R blockers. This gene-drug pair 
      provides an example to test whether associations of IL6R SNPs with a broad range 
      of phenotypes can inform which diseases may benefit from treatment with IL6R 
      blockade. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether screening for clinical associations 
      with the IL6R SNP in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) using EHR biobank 
      data can identify drug effects from IL6R clinical trials. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Diagnosis codes and routine laboratory measurements were extracted 
      from the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP); diagnosis codes were mapped to 
      phenotype groups using published PheWAS methods. A PheWAS was performed by 
      fitting logistic regression models for testing associations of the IL6R SNPs with 
      1342 phenotype groups and by fitting linear regression models for testing 
      associations of the IL6R SNP with 26 routine laboratory measurements. 
      Significance was reported using a false discovery rate of 0.05 or less. Findings 
      were replicated in 2 independent cohorts using UK Biobank and Vanderbilt 
      University Biobank data. The Million Veteran Program included 332 799 US 
      veterans; the UK Biobank, 408 455 individuals from the general population of the 
      United Kingdom; and the Vanderbilt University Biobank, 13 835 patients from a 
      tertiary care center. EXPOSURES: IL6R SNPs (rs2228145; rs4129267). MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: Phenotypes defined by International Classification of Diseases, 
      Ninth Revision codes. RESULTS: Of the 332 799 veterans included in the main 
      cohort, 305 228 (91.7%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 66.1 (13.6) years. 
      The IL6R SNP was most strongly associated with a reduced risk of aortic aneurysm 
      phenotypes (odds ratio, 0.87-0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.93) in the MVP. We observed 
      known off-target effects of IL6R blockade from clinical trials (eg, higher 
      hemoglobin level). The reduced risk for aortic aneurysms among those with the 
      IL6R SNP in the MVP was replicated in the Vanderbilt University Biobank, and the 
      reduced risk for coronary heart disease was replicated in the UK Biobank. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated 
      application of the PheWAS using large EHR biobanks to inform drug effects. The 
      findings of an association of the IL6R SNP with reduced risk for aortic aneurysms 
      correspond with the newest indication for IL6R blockade, giant cell arteritis, of 
      which a major complication is aortic aneurysm.

AB  - In this paper we report on an automated procedure to capture and characterize the 
      detailed structure of a crop canopy by means of stereo imaging. We focus 
      attention specifically on the detailed characteristic of canopy height 
      distribution-canopy shoot area as a function of height-which can provide an 
      elaborate picture of canopy growth and health under a given set of conditions. We 
      apply the method to a wheat field trial involving ten Australian wheat varieties 
      that were subjected to two different fertilizer treatments. A novel camera 
      self-calibration approach is proposed which allows the determination of 
      quantitative plant canopy height data (as well as other valuable phenotypic 
      information) by stereo matching. Utilizing the canopy height distribution to 
      provide a measure of canopy height, the results compare favourably with manual 
      measurements of canopy height (resulting in an R2 value of 0.92), and are indeed 
      shown to be more consistent. By comparing canopy height distributions of 
      different varieties and different treatments, the methodology shows that 
      different varieties subjected to the same treatment, and the same variety 
      subjected to different treatments can respond in much more distinctive and 
      quantifiable ways within their respective canopies than can be captured by a 
      simple trait measure such as overall canopy height.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies of case-control status have advanced the 
      understanding of the genetic basis of psychiatric disorders. Further progress may 
      be gained by increasing sample size but also by new analysis strategies that 
      advance the exploitation of existing data, especially for clinically important 
      quantitative phenotypes. The functionally-informed efficient region-based test 
      strategy (FIERS) introduced herein uses prior knowledge on biological function 
      and dependence of genotypes within a powerful statistical framework with improved 
      sensitivity and specificity for detecting consistent genetic effects across 
      studies. As proof of concept, FIERS was used for the first genome-wide single 
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based investigation on bipolar disorder (BD) that 
      focuses on an important aspect of disease course, the functional outcome. FIERS 
      identified a significantly associated locus on chromosome 15 (hg38: 
      chr15:48965004 - 49464789 bp) with consistent effect strength between two 
      independent studies (GAIN/TGen: European Americans, BOMA: Germans; n = 1592 BD 
      patients in total). Protective and risk haplotypes were found on the most 
      strongly associated SNPs. They contain a CTCF binding site (rs586758); CTCF sites 
      are known to regulate sets of genes within a chromatin domain. The rs586758 - 
      rs2086256 - rs1904317 haplotype is located in the promoter flanking region of the 
      COPS2 gene, close to microRNA4716, and the EID1, SHC4, DTWD1 genes as plausible 
      biological candidates. While implication with BD is novel, COPS2, EID1, and SHC4 
      are known to be relevant for neuronal differentiation and function and DTWD1 for 
      psychopharmacological side effects. The test strategy FIERS that enabled this 
      discovery is equally applicable for tag SNPs and sequence data.

TI  - A longitudinal approach to biological psychiatric research: The PsyCourse study.
PG  - 89-102
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32639 [doi]
AB  - In current diagnostic systems, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are still 
      conceptualized as distinct categorical entities. Recently, both clinical and 
      genomic evidence have challenged this Kraepelinian dichotomy. There are only few 
      longitudinal studies addressing potential overlaps between these conditions. 
      Here, we present design and first results of the PsyCourse study (N = 891 
      individuals at baseline), an ongoing transdiagnostic study of the 
      affective-to-psychotic continuum that combines longitudinal deep phenotyping and 
      dimensional assessment of psychopathology with an extensive collection of 
      biomaterial. To provide an initial characterization of the PsyCourse study 
      sample, we compare two broad diagnostic groups defined by the Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) classification 
      system, that is, predominantly affective (n = 367 individuals) versus 
      predominantly psychotic disorders (n = 524 individuals). Depressive, manic, and 
      psychotic symptoms as well as global functioning over time were contrasted using 
      linear mixed models. Furthermore, we explored the effects of polygenic risk 
      scores for schizophrenia on diagnostic group membership and addressed their 
      effects on nonparticipation in follow-up visits. While phenotypic results 
      confirmed expected differences in current psychotic symptoms and global 
      functioning, both manic and depressive symptoms did not vary between both groups 
      after correction for multiple testing. Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia 
      significantly explained part of the variability of diagnostic group. The 
      PsyCourse study presents a unique resource to research the complex relationships 
      of psychopathology and biology in severe mental disorders not confined to 
      traditional diagnostic boundaries and is open for collaborations.

AB  - We are entering a new era of mouse phenomics, driven by large-scale and 
      economical generation of mouse mutants coupled with increasingly sophisticated 
      and comprehensive phenotyping. These studies are generating large, 
      multidimensional gene-phenotype data sets, which are shedding new light on the 
      mammalian genome landscape and revealing many hitherto unknown features of 
      mammalian gene function. Moreover, these phenome resources provide a wealth of 
      disease models and can be integrated with human genomics data as a powerful 
      approach for the interpretation of human genetic variation and its relationship 
      to disease. In the future, the development of novel phenotyping platforms allied 
      to improved computational approaches, including machine learning, for the 
      analysis of phenotype data will continue to enhance our ability to develop a 
      comprehensive and powerful model of mammalian gene-phenotype space.

TI  - Guidelines and considerations for the use of system suitability and quality 
      control samples in mass spectrometry assays applied in untargeted clinical

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) are two quality 
      management processes that are integral to the success of metabolomics including 
      their application for the acquisition of high quality data in any high-throughput 
      analytical chemistry laboratory. QA defines all the planned and systematic 
      activities implemented before samples are collected, to provide confidence that a 
      subsequent analytical process will fulfil predetermined requirements for quality. 
      QC can be defined as the operational techniques and activities used to measure 
      and report these quality requirements after data acquisition. AIM OF REVIEW: This 
      tutorial review will guide the reader through the use of system suitability and 
      QC samples, why these samples should be applied and how the quality of data can 
      be reported. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: System suitability samples are 
      applied to assess the operation and lack of contamination of the analytical 
      platform prior to sample analysis. Isotopically-labelled internal standards are 
      applied to assess system stability for each sample analysed. Pooled QC samples 
      are applied to condition the analytical platform, perform intra-study 
      reproducibility measurements (QC) and to correct mathematically for systematic 
      errors. Standard reference materials and long-term reference QC samples are 
      applied for inter-study and inter-laboratory assessment of data.

TI  - Detecting significant genotype-phenotype association rules in bipolar disorder: 
      market research meets complex genetics.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1186/s40345-018-0132-x [doi]
LID - 24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disentangling the etiology of common, complex diseases is a major 
      challenge in genetic research. For bipolar disorder (BD), several genome-wide 
      association studies (GWAS) have been performed. Similar to other complex 
      disorders, major breakthroughs in explaining the high heritability of BD through 
      GWAS have remained elusive. To overcome this dilemma, genetic research into BD, 
      has embraced a variety of strategies such as the formation of large consortia to 
      increase sample size and sequencing approaches. Here we advocate a complementary 
      approach making use of already existing GWAS data: a novel data mining procedure 
      to identify yet undetected genotype-phenotype relationships. We adapted 
      association rule mining, a data mining technique traditionally used in retail 
      market research, to identify frequent and characteristic genotype patterns 
      showing strong associations to phenotype clusters. We applied this strategy to 
      three independent GWAS datasets from 2835 phenotypically characterized patients 
      with BD. In a discovery step, 20,882 candidate association rules were extracted. 
      RESULTS: Two of these rules-one associated with eating disorder and the other 
      with anxiety-remained significant in an independent dataset after robust 
      correction for multiple testing. Both showed considerable effect sizes (odds 
      ratio ~ 3.4 and 3.0, respectively) and support previously reported molecular 
      biological findings. CONCLUSION: Our approach detected novel specific 
      genotype-phenotype relationships in BD that were missed by standard analyses like 
      GWAS. While we developed and applied our method within the context of BD gene 
      discovery, it may facilitate identifying highly specific genotype-phenotype 
      relationships in subsets of genome-wide data sets of other complex phenotype with 
      similar epidemiological properties and challenges to gene discovery efforts.

TI  - Applying the latest advances in genomics and phenomics for trait discovery in 
      polyploid wheat.
PG  - 56-72
LID - 10.1111/tpj.14150 [doi]
AB  - Improving traits in wheat has historically been challenging due to its large and 
      polyploid genome, limited genetic diversity and in-field phenotyping constraints. 
      However, within recent years many of these barriers have been lowered. The 
      availability of a chromosome-level assembly of the wheat genome now facilitates a 
      step-change in wheat genetics and provides a common platform for resources, 
      including variation data, gene expression data and genetic markers. The 
      development of sequenced mutant populations and gene-editing techniques now 
      enables the rapid assessment of gene function in wheat directly. The ability to 
      alter gene function in a targeted manner will unmask the effects of homoeolog 
      redundancy and allow the hidden potential of this polyploid genome to be 
      discovered. New techniques to identify and exploit the genetic diversity within 
      wheat wild relatives now enable wheat breeders to take advantage of these 
      additional sources of variation to address challenges facing food production. 
      Finally, advances in phenomics have unlocked rapid screening of populations for 
      many traits of interest both in greenhouses and in the field. Looking forwards, 
      integrating diverse data types, including genomic, epigenetic and phenomics data, 
      will take advantage of big data approaches including machine learning to 
      understand trait biology in wheat in unprecedented detail.

TI  - Leptin gene polymorphisms are associated with weight gain during lithium 
      augmentation in patients with major depression.

AB  - Weight gain is a common adverse effect of lithium augmentation. Previous studies 
      indicate an impact of genetic variants at the leptin gene on weight gain as a 
      consequence of psychopharmacological treatment. The primary aim of our study was 
      to identify variants at the leptin locus that might predict lithium-induced 
      weight gain. The secondary aim was to investigate if these variants modulate 
      leptin levels. In 180 patients with acute major depressive disorder, body mass 
      index was measured before and after 4 weeks of lithium augmentation, in a 
      subsample also after 4 and/or 7 months. In a subsample of 89 patients, leptin 
      serum concentrations were measured before and during lithium augmentation. We 
      used linear mixed model analyzes to investigate the effects of 2 polymorphisms at 
      the leptin locus (rs4731426 and rs7799039, employing the respective proxy SNPs 
      rs2278815 and rs10487506) on changes in body mass index and leptin levels. For 
      both polymorphisms, which are in high linkage disequilibrium, body mass index was 
      significantly lower in homozygous A-allele carriers than in carriers of other 
      genotypes at baseline. Over the follow-up period, body mass index increased less 
      in homozygous A-allele carriers of rs4731426 than in carriers of other genotypes. 
      This was not the case for rs7799039. Neither polymorphism modulated leptin 
      protein expression. Our study strongly supports the hypothesis that genetic 
      variability at the leptin locus is involved in lithium augmentation-associated 
      weight gain in major depressive disorder. Furthermore, Genotype-Tissue Expression 
      data provide strong evidence that rs4731426 influences the expression of leptin 
      messenger ribonucleic acid in fibroblasts.

LID - 10.1093/nar/gkx1082 [doi]
AB  - The Mouse Phenome Database (MPD; https://phenome.jax.org) is a widely used 
      resource that provides access to primary experimental trait data, genotypic 
      variation, protocols and analysis tools for mouse genetic studies. Data are 
      contributed by investigators worldwide and represent a broad scope of phenotyping 
      endpoints and disease-related traits in naïve mice and those exposed to drugs, 
      environmental agents or other treatments. MPD houses individual animal data with 
      detailed, searchable protocols, and makes these data available to other resources 
      via API. MPD provides rigorous curation of experimental data and supporting 
      documentation using relevant ontologies and controlled vocabularies. Most data in 
      MPD are from inbreds and other reproducible strains such that the data are 
      cumulative over time and across laboratories. The resource has been expanded to 
      include the QTL Archive and other primary phenotype data from mapping crosses as 
      well as advanced high-diversity mouse populations including the Collaborative 
      Cross and Diversity Outbred mice. Furthermore, MPD provides a means of assessing 
      replicability and reproducibility across experimental conditions and protocols, 
      benchmarking assays in users' own laboratories, identifying sensitized 
      backgrounds for making new mouse models with genome editing technologies, 
      analyzing trait co-inheritance, finding the common genetic basis for multiple 
      traits and assessing sex differences and sex-by-genotype interactions.

TI  - Cell Wall Epitopes and Endoploidy as Reporters of Embryogenic Potential in 
      Brachypodium Distachyon Callus Culture.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19123811 [doi]
LID - 3811
AB  - Effective regeneration of callus tissue into embryos and then into whole plants 
      is essential for plant biotechnology. The embryonic potential is often low and 
      can further decrease with time in culture, which limits the utilisation of calli 
      for transformation procedures and in vitro propagation. In this study, we show 
      that the loss of embryogenic potential in callus cultures of Brachypodium 
      distachyon is progressive over time. Flow cytometry analyses indicated endoploidy 
      levels increased in 60- and 90-day-old calli with effective loss of the 2C DNA 
      content peak in the latter. Analysis of indolic compounds content revealed a 
      decrease in 60- and 90-day-old calli compared to either freshly isolated explants 
      or 30-day-old calli. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a decrease in 
      arabinogalactan proteins (AGP) signal with the time of culture, but extensin 
      (EXT) epitopes either increased (JIM12 epitopes) or decreased (JIM11 epitopes). 
      The transcript accumulation levels of AGPs and EXTs confirmed these results, with 
      most of AGP and EXT transcripts gradually decreasing. Some chimeric EXT 
      transcripts significantly increased on the 30th day of culture, perhaps because 
      of an increased embryogenic potential. Selected somatic embryogenesis-related 
      genes and cyclins demonstrated a gradual decrease of transcript accumulation for 
      YUCCA (YUC), AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE (AIL), BABY BOOM (BBM), and CLAVATA (CLV3) genes, 
      as well as for most of the cyclins, starting from the 30th day of culture. 
      Notably, WUSCHEL (WUS) transcript was detectable only on the 30th and 60th day 
      and was not detectable in the zygotic embryos and in 90-day-old calli.

TI  - Characterization of GMO or glyphosate effects on the composition of maize grain 
      and maize-based diet for rat feeding.
PG  - 36
LID - 10.1007/s11306-018-1329-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In addition to classical targeted biochemical analyses, metabolomic 
      analyses seem pertinent to reveal expected as well as unexpected compositional 
      differences between plant genetically modified organisms (GMO) and non-GMO 
      samples. Data previously published in the existing literature led to divergent 
      conclusions on the effect of maize transgenes on grain compositional changes and 
      feeding effects. Therefore, a new study examining field-grown harvested products 
      and feeds derived from them remains useful. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to use a 
      metabolomics approach to characterize grain and grain-based diet compositional 
      changes for two GMO events, one involving Bacillus thuringiensis toxin to provide 
      insect resistance and the other one conferring herbicide tolerance by 
      detoxification of glyphosate. We also investigated the potential compositional 
      modifications induced by the use of a glyphosate-based herbicide on the 
      transgenic line conferring glyphosate tolerance. RESULTS: The majority of 
      statistically significant differences in grain composition, evidenced by the use 
      of (1)H-NMR profiling of polar extracts and LC-ESI-QTOF-MS profiling of 
      semi-polar extracts, could be attributed to the combined effect of genotype and 
      environment. In comparison, transgene and glyphosate effects remained limited in 
      grain for the compound families studied. Some but not all compositional changes 
      observed in grain were also detected in grain-based diets formulated for rats. 
      CONCLUSION: Only part of the data previously published in the existing literature 
      on maize grains of plants with the same GMO events could be reproduced in our 
      experiment. All spectra have been deposited in a repository freely accessible to 
      the public. Our grain and diet characterization opened the way for an in depth 
      study of the effects of these diets on rat health.

AB  - The way plants are grown and samples are harvested, prepared, and extracted has a 
      profound impact on the output of a metabolomics experiment. In this chapter, we 
      detail the experimental procedures from plant cultivation to extract preparation, 
      in order to avoid difficulties that could result in contamination or undesired 
      changes of the analytes. Two plant organs are mentioned as examples: tomato 
      fruits (Solanum lycopersicum) and flax seeds (Linum usitatissimum). Extractions 
      designed for the untargeted analysis of semipolar compounds by liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and targeted analysis of fatty acids by 
      gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or gas chromatography with flame 
      ionization detector (GC-FID) are described.

AB  - This Review discusses crucial areas related to the identification, clinical 
      presentation, course, and therapeutic management of bipolar disorder, a major 
      psychiatric illness. Bipolar disorder is often misdiagnosed, leading to 
      inappropriate, inadequate, or delayed treatment. Even when bipolar disorder is 
      successfully diagnosed, its clinical management presents several major 
      challenges, including how best to optimise treatment for an individual patient, 
      and how to balance the benefits and risks of polypharmacy. We discuss the major 
      unmet needs in the diagnosis and management of bipolar disorder in this Review, 
      including improvement of adequate recognition and intervention in at-risk and 
      early-disease stages, identification of reliable warning signs and prevention of 
      relapses in unstable and rapid cycling patients, treatment of refractory 
      depression, and prevention of suicide. Taken together, there are several 
      promising opportunities for improving treatment of bipolar disorder to deliver 
      medical care that is more personalised.

AB  - In the evolution of cognition and behavior, a recurrent question concerns the 
      degree to which any given aspect of the phenotype has been "selected for" or 
      "specified," as opposed to arising as a byproduct of some other process. In some 
      sense this is the key question for evolutionary theories of development that seek 
      to connect ultimate evolutionary accounts to proximate developmental accounts of 
      ontogeny. A popular solution to the specification problem is to invoke 
      "emergence," in which phenotypes are co-constructed by many causes and cannot be 
      reduced to any one of them. However, the concept of emergence, while appealing, 
      can obscure sources of ultimate causation by leaving them unspecified. Here I 
      explore the idea of selected emergence, in which phenotypic outcomes do emerge 
      from a confluence of factors, some haphazard, but which include in part a history 
      of selection, genetic and / or cultural, to produce phenotypic outcomes of that 
      type. I discuss potential case studies of selected emergence, explore its 
      empirical implications and provide suggestions for future research on the 
      evolution of emergent outcomes.

TI  - Phenome-wide association study identifies dsDNA as a driver of major organ 
      involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus.

AB  - In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dsDNA antibodies are associated with renal 
      disease. Less is known about comorbidities in patients without dsDNA or other 
      autoantibodies. Using an electronic health record (EHR) SLE cohort, we employed a 
      phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) that scans across billing codes to 
      compare comorbidities in SLE patients with and without autoantibodies. We used 
      our validated algorithm to identify SLE subjects. Autoantibody status was defined 
      as ever positive for dsDNA, RNP, Smith, SSA and SSB. PheWAS was performed in 
      antibody positive vs. negative SLE patients adjusting for age and race and using 
      a false discovery rate of 0.05. We identified 1097 SLE subjects. In the PheWAS of 
      dsDNA positive vs. negative subjects, dsDNA positive subjects were more likely to 
      have nephritis ( p = 2.33 × 10(-9)) and renal failure ( p = 1.85 × 10(-5)). After 
      adjusting for sex, race, age and other autoantibodies, dsDNA was independently 
      associated with nephritis and chronic kidney disease. Those patients negative for 
      dsDNA, RNP, SSA and SSB negative subjects were all more likely to have billing 
      codes for sleep, pain and mood disorders. PheWAS uncovered a hierarchy within 
      SLE-specific autoantibodies with dsDNA having the greatest impact on major organ 
      involvement.

TI  - Phenome-wide association study identifies marked increased in burden of 
      comorbidities in African Americans with systemic lupus erythematosus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: African Americans with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have 
      increased renal disease compared to Caucasians, but differences in other 
      comorbidities have not been well-described. We used an electronic health record 
      (EHR) technique to test for differences in comorbidities in African Americans 
      compared to Caucasians with SLE. METHODS: We used a de-identified EHR with 2.8 
      million subjects to identify SLE cases using a validated algorithm. We performed 
      phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) comparing African American to Caucasian 
      SLE cases and African American SLE cases to matched non-SLE controls. Controls 
      were age, sex, and race matched to SLE cases. For multiple testing, a false 
      discovery rate (FDR) p value of 0.05 was used. RESULTS: We identified 270 African 
      Americans and 715 Caucasians with SLE and 1425 matched African American controls. 
      Compared to Caucasians with SLE adjusting for age and sex, African Americans with 
      SLE had more comorbidities in every organ system. The most striking included 
      hypertension odds ratio (OR) = 4.25, FDR p = 5.49 × 10(- 15); renal dialysis OR = 
      10.90, FDR p = 8.75 × 10(- 14); and pneumonia OR = 3.57, FDR p = 2.32 × 10(- 8). 
      Compared to the African American matched controls without SLE, African Americans 
      with SLE were more likely to have comorbidities in every organ system. The most 
      significant codes were renal and cardiac, and included renal failure (OR = 9.55, 
      FDR p = 2.26 × 10(- 40)) and hypertensive heart and renal disease (OR = 8.08, FDR 
      p = 1.78 × 10(- 22)). Adjusting for race, age, and sex in a model including both 
      African American and Caucasian SLE cases and controls, SLE was independently 
      associated with renal, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases (all p < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: African Americans with SLE have an increased comorbidity burden 
      compared to Caucasians with SLE and matched controls. This increase in 
      comorbidities in African Americans with SLE highlights the need to monitor for 
      cardiovascular and infectious complications.

TI  - Phenome-Wide Association Studies Uncover a Novel Association of Increased Atrial

PG  - 1630-1636
LID - 10.1002/acr.23553 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) scan across billing codes in 
      the electronic health record (EHR) and re-purpose clinical EHR data for research. 
      In this study, we examined whether PheWAS could function as an EHR-based 
      discovery tool for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and identified novel 
      clinical associations in male versus female patients with SLE. METHODS: We used a 
      de-identified version of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center EHR, which 
      includes more than 2.8 million subjects. We performed EHR-based PheWAS to compare 
      SLE patients with age-, sex-, and race-matched control subjects and to compare 
      male SLE patients with female SLE patients, controlling for multiple testing 
      using a false discovery rate (FDR) P value of 0.05. RESULTS: We identified 1,097 
      patients with SLE and 5,735 matched control subjects. In a comparison of patients 
      with SLE and matched controls, SLE patients were shown to be more likely to have 
      International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes related to the SLE 
      disease criteria. In the PheWAS of male versus female SLE patients, with 
      adjustment for age and race, male patients were shown to be more likely to have 
      atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 4.50, false discovery rate P = 3.23 × 10(-3) ). 
      Chart review confirmed atrial fibrillation, with the majority of patients 
      developing atrial fibrillation after the SLE diagnosis and having multiple risk 
      factors for atrial fibrillation. After adjustment for age, sex, race, and 
      coronary artery disease, SLE disease status was shown to be significantly 
      associated with atrial fibrillation (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Using PheWAS to 
      compare male and female patients with SLE, we identified a novel association of 
      an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in male patients. SLE disease 
      status was shown to be independently associated with atrial fibrillation, even 
      after adjustment for age, sex, race, and coronary artery disease. These results 
      demonstrate the utility of PheWAS as an EHR-based discovery tool for SLE.

TI  - A new method for the rapid characterization of root growth and distribution using 
      digital image correlation.
PG  - 835-846
LID - 10.1111/nph.15009 [doi]
AB  - Rapidly determining root growth patterns is biologically important and 
      technically challenging. Current methods focus on direct observation of roots and 
      require destructive excavations or time-consuming root tracing. We developed a 
      novel methodology based on analyzing soil particle displacement, rather than 
      direct observation of roots. This inferred root growth method uses digital image 
      correlation (DIC) analysis, an established and high-throughput method used in 
      many engineering and science disciplines. By applying DIC analyses to repeated 
      images of plants grown in clear window boxes, we produced visually intuitive and 
      quantifiable strain maps, indicating the magnitude and direction of soil 
      movement. From this, we could infer root growth and rapidly quantify root system 
      metrics. Strain measures were closely associated with the spatial distribution of 
      roots and correlated with root length measured using conventional approaches. The 
      method also allowed for the detection of root proliferation in nutrient-enriched 
      soil patches, indicating its suitability for quantifying biological patterns. 
      This novel application of DIC in root biology is effective, scalable, low cost, 
      flexible and complementary to existing technologies. This method offers a new 
      tool for answering questions in plant biology and will be particularly useful in 
      studies involving temporal dynamics of root processes.

TI  - Carbon isotope composition, water use efficiency, and drought sensitivity are 
      controlled by a common genomic segment in maize.

AB  - A genomic segment on maize chromosome 7 influences carbon isotope composition, 
      water use efficiency, and leaf growth sensitivity to drought, possibly by 
      affecting stomatal properties. Climate change is expected to decrease water 
      availability in many agricultural production areas around the globe. Therefore, 
      plants with improved ability to grow under water deficit are urgently needed. We 
      combined genetic, phenomic, and physiological approaches to understand the 
      relationship between growth, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, and 
      carbon isotope composition in maize (Zea mays L.). Using near-isogenic lines 
      derived from a maize introgression library, we analysed the effects of a genomic 
      region previously identified as affecting carbon isotope composition. We show 
      stability of trait expression over several years of field trials and demonstrate 
      in the phenotyping platform Phenodyn that the same genomic region also influences 
      the sensitivity of leaf growth to evaporative demand and soil water potential. 
      Our results suggest that the studied genomic region affecting carbon isotope 
      discrimination also harbours quantitative trait loci playing a role in maize 
      drought sensitivity possibly via stomatal behaviour and development. We propose 
      that the observed phenotypes collectively originate from altered stomatal 
      conductance, presumably via abscisic acid.

AB  - Major increases in crop yield are required to keep pace with population growth 
      and climate change. Improvements to the architecture of crop roots promise to 
      deliver increases in water and nutrient use efficiency but profiling the root 
      phenome (i.e. its structure and function) represents a major bottleneck. We 
      describe how advances in imaging and sensor technologies are making root phenomic 
      studies possible. However, methodological advances in acquisition, handling and 
      processing of the resulting 'big-data' is becoming increasingly important. 
      Advances in automated image analysis approaches such as Deep Learning promise to 
      transform the root phenotyping landscape. Collectively, these innovations are 
      helping drive the selection of the next-generation of crops to deliver real world 
      impact for ongoing global food security efforts.

TI  - Mapping of novel salt tolerance QTL in an Excalibur × Kukri doubled haploid wheat 
      population.
PG  - 2179-2196
LID - 10.1007/s00122-018-3146-y [doi]
AB  - Novel QTL for salinity tolerance traits have been detected using non-destructive 
      and destructive phenotyping in bread wheat and were shown to be linked to 
      improvements in yield in saline fields. Soil salinity is a major limitation to 
      cereal production. Breeding new salt-tolerant cultivars has the potential to 
      improve cereal crop yields. In this study, a doubled haploid bread wheat mapping 
      population, derived from the bi-parental cross of Excalibur × Kukri, was grown in 
      a glasshouse under control and salinity treatments and evaluated using 
      high-throughput non-destructive imaging technology. Quantitative trait locus 
      (QTL) analysis of this population detected multiple QTL under salt and control 
      treatments. Of these, six QTL were detected in the salt treatment including one 
      for maintenance of shoot growth under salinity (QG((1-5)).asl-7A), one for leaf 
      Na(+) exclusion (QNa.asl-7A) and four for leaf K(+) accumulation (QK.asl-2B.1, 
      QK.asl-2B.2, QK.asl-5A and QK:Na.asl-6A). The beneficial allele for 
      QG((1-5)).asl-7A (the maintenance of shoot growth under salinity) was present in 
      six out of 44 mainly Australian bread and durum wheat cultivars. The effect of 
      each QTL allele on grain yield was tested in a range of salinity concentrations 
      at three field sites across 2 years. In six out of nine field trials with 
      different levels of salinity stress, lines with alleles for Na(+) exclusion 
      and/or K(+) maintenance at three QTL (QNa.asl-7A, QK.asl-2B.2 and QK:Na.asl-6A) 
      excluded more Na(+) or accumulated more K(+) compared to lines without these 
      alleles. Importantly, the QK.asl-2B.2 allele for higher K(+) accumulation was 
      found to be associated with higher grain yield at all field sites. Several 
      alleles at other QTL were associated with higher grain yields at selected field 
      sites.

TI  - Post-genomic behavioral genetics: From revolution to routine.
PG  - e12441
LID - 10.1111/gbb.12441 [doi]
AB  - What was once expensive and revolutionary-full-genome sequence-is now affordable 
      and routine. Costs will continue to drop, opening up new frontiers in behavioral 
      genetics. This shift in costs from the genome to the phenome is most notable in 
      large clinical studies of behavior and associated diseases in cohorts that exceed 
      hundreds of thousands of subjects. Examples include the Women's Health Initiative 
      (www.whi.org), the Million Veterans Program (www. RESEARCH: va.gov/MVP), the 
      100 000 Genomes Project (genomicsengland.co.uk) and commercial efforts such as 
      those by deCode (www.decode.com) and 23andme (www.23andme.com). The same 
      transition is happening in experimental neuro- and behavioral genetics, and 
      sample sizes of many hundreds of cases are becoming routine (www.genenetwork.org, 
      www.mousephenotyping.org). There are two major consequences of this new 
      affordability of massive omics datasets: (1) it is now far more practical to 
      explore genetic modulation of behavioral differences and the key role of 
      gene-by-environment interactions. Researchers are already doing the hard part-the 
      quantitative analysis of behavior. Adding the omics component can provide 
      powerful links to molecules, cells, circuits and even better treatment. (2) There 
      is an acute need to highlight and train behavioral scientists in how best to 
      exploit new omics approaches. This review addresses this second issue and 
      highlights several new trends and opportunities that will be of interest to 
      experts in animal and human behaviors.

AB  - Drought is one of the severe abiotic stress that affects the productivity of 
      rice, an important staple crop that is consumed all over the world. The traits 
      responsible for enhancing or adapting drought resistance in rice plants can be 
      selected and studied to improve their growth under stress conditions. Experiments 
      have been conducted on indica rice varieties comprising Sahabhagidhan as drought 
      tolerant variety and IR64, MTU1010 categorized as drought sensitive varieties. 
      Various root related biochemical and morphological traits such as root length, 
      relative water content (RWC), xylem number, xylem area, proline content, and 
      malondialdehyde content have been investigated for a comparative study of the 
      plant response to drought stress in different rice varieties. The results of 
      differential root transcriptome analysis have revealed that there is a notable 
      difference in gene expression of OsPIP2;5 and OsNIP2;1 in various indica 
      varieties of rice at different time periods of stress. The present work aims at 
      assessing the correlation between genotypic and phenotypic traits that can 
      contribute towards the emerging field of rice phenomics.

TI  - Analysis of shared heritability in common disorders of the brain.
LID - 10.1126/science.aap8757 [doi]
LID - eaap8757
AB  - Disorders of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and 
      often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We 
      quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders from genome-wide association 
      studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their 
      relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric disorders 
      share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinct 
      from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified 
      significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including 
      cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical 
      power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic 
      correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation 
      as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods 
      in understanding their etiology.

TI  - Targeting inflammatory monocytes in sepsis-associated encephalopathy and 
      long-term cognitive impairment.

AB  - Sepsis-associated encephalopathy manifesting as delirium is a common problem in 
      critical care medicine. In this study, patients that had delirium due to sepsis 
      had significant cognitive impairments at 12-18 months after hospital discharge 
      when compared with controls and Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Test 
      Battery-standardized scores in spatial recognition memory, pattern recognition 
      memory, and delayed-matching-to-sample tests but not other cognitive functions. A 
      mouse model of S. pneumoniae pneumonia-induced sepsis, which modeled numerous 
      aspects of the human sepsis-associated multiorgan dysfunction, including 
      encephalopathy, also revealed similar deficits in spatial memory but not new task 
      learning. Both humans and mice had large increases in chemokines for myeloid cell 
      recruitment. Intravital imaging of the brains of septic mice revealed increased 
      neutrophil and CCR2+ inflammatory monocyte recruitment (the latter being far more 
      robust), accompanied by subtle microglial activation. Prevention of CCR2+ 
      inflammatory monocyte recruitment, but not neutrophil recruitment, reduced 
      microglial activation and other signs of neuroinflammation and prevented all 
      signs of cognitive impairment after infection. Therefore, therapeutically 
      targeting CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes at the time of sepsis may provide a novel 
      neuroprotective clinical intervention to prevent the development of persistent 
      cognitive impairments.

TI  - Effects of Azithromycin on Behavior, Pathologic Signs, and Changes in Cytokines, 
      Chemokines, and Neutrophil Migration in C57BL/6 Mice Exposed to Dextran Sulfate 
      Sodium.
PG  - 4-15
LID - 10.30802/AALAS-CM-18-000001 [doi]
AB  - Here we characterized the murine dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model of acute 
      colitis. Specifically, we evaluated azithromycin and metronidazole treatment 
      regimens to assess their effects on animal wellbeing, pathologic changes, barrier 
      function, cytokine and chemokine profiles, and neutrophil migration in colon 
      tissue. Azithromycin treatment significantly reduced the severity of colitis, as 
      assessed through body weight change, water consumption, macroscopic lesions, and 
      animal behaviors (activity level, climbing, and grooming), but did not alter food 
      consumption or feeding behavior. Mucosal barrier function (evaluated by using 
      FITC-labeled dextran) was decreased after DSS exposure; azithromycin did not 
      significantly alter barrier function in mice with colitis, whereas metronidazole 
      exacerbated the colitis-related deficit in barrier function. In addition, 
      metronidazole appeared to exacerbate disease as assessed through water 
      consumption and animal behaviors (overall activity, climbing, grooming, and 
      drinking) but had no effect on weight loss, macroscopic lesions, or eating 
      behavior. Pathologic changes were typical for DSS treatment. Antibiotic treatment 
      resulted in reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and 
      decreased neutrophil adhesion and emigration in DSS-exposed mice. The results 
      highlight the importance of clinical and behavioral assessments in addition to 
      laboratory evaluation as tools to evaluate animal welfare and therapeutic 
      efficacy in disease models. Data from this study suggest that azithromycin may 
      convey some benefits in the mouse DSS colitis model through modulation of the 
      immune response, including neutrophil migration into tissues, whereas 
      metronidazole may exacerbate colitis.

TI  - Association of Polygenic Score for Schizophrenia and HLA Antigen and Inflammation 
      Genes With Response to Lithium in Bipolar Affective Disorder: A Genome-Wide 
      Association Study.
PG  - 65-74
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.3433 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Lithium is a first-line mood stabilizer for the treatment of bipolar 
      affective disorder (BPAD). However, the efficacy of lithium varies widely, with a 
      nonresponse rate of up to 30%. Biological response markers are lacking. Genetic 
      factors are thought to mediate treatment response to lithium, and there is a 
      previously reported genetic overlap between BPAD and schizophrenia (SCZ). 
      OBJECTIVES: To test whether a polygenic score for SCZ is associated with 
      treatment response to lithium in BPAD and to explore the potential molecular 
      underpinnings of this association. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 
      2586 patients with BPAD who had undergone lithium treatment were genotyped and 
      assessed for long-term response to treatment between 2008 and 2013. Weighted SCZ 
      polygenic scores were computed at different P value thresholds using summary 
      statistics from an international multicenter genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
      of 36 989 individuals with SCZ and genotype data from patients with BPAD from the 
      Consortium on Lithium Genetics. For functional exploration, a cross-trait 
      meta-GWAS and pathway analysis was performed, combining GWAS summary statistics 
      on SCZ and response to treatment with lithium. Data analysis was performed from 
      September 2016 to February 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Treatment response 
      to lithium was defined on both the categorical and continuous scales using the 
      Retrospective Criteria of Long-Term Treatment Response in Research Subjects with 
      Bipolar Disorder score. The effect measures include odds ratios and the 
      proportion of variance explained. RESULTS: Of the 2586 patients in the study 
      (mean [SD] age, 47.2 [13.9] years), 1478 were women and 1108 were men. The 
      polygenic score for SCZ was inversely associated with lithium treatment response 
      in the categorical outcome, at a threshold P < 5 × 10-2. Patients with BPAD who 
      had a low polygenic load for SCZ responded better to lithium, with odds ratios 
      for lithium response ranging from 3.46 (95% CI, 1.42-8.41) at the first decile to 
      2.03 (95% CI, 0.86-4.81) at the ninth decile, compared with the patients in the 
      10th decile of SCZ risk. In the cross-trait meta-GWAS, 15 genetic loci that may 
      have overlapping effects on lithium treatment response and susceptibility to SCZ 
      were identified. Functional pathway and network analysis of these loci point to 
      the HLA antigen complex and inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      This study provides evidence for a negative association between high genetic 
      loading for SCZ and poor response to lithium in patients with BPAD. These results 
      suggest the potential for translational research aimed at personalized 
      prescribing of lithium.

TI  - Human monocyte transcriptional profiling identifies IL-18 receptor accessory 
      protein and lactoferrin as novel immune targets in hypertension.
PG  - 2015-2027
LID - 10.1111/bph.14364 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Monocytes play a critical role in hypertension. The 
      purpose of our study was to use an unbiased approach to determine whether 
      hypertensive individuals on conventional therapy exhibit an altered monocyte gene 
      expression profile and to perform validation studies of selected genes to 
      identify novel therapeutic targets for hypertension. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Next 
      generation RNA sequencing identified differentially expressed genes in a small 
      discovery cohort of normotensive and hypertensive individuals. Several of these 
      genes were further investigated for association with hypertension in multiple 
      validation cohorts using qRT-PCR, regression analysis, phenome-wide association 
      study and case-control analysis of a missense polymorphism. KEY RESULTS: We 
      identified 60 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in 
      hypertensive monocytes, many of which are related to IL-1β. Uni- and multivariate 
      regression analyses of the expression of these genes with mean arterial pressure 
      (MAP) revealed four genes that significantly correlated with MAP in normotensive 
      and/or hypertensive individuals. Of these, lactoferrin (LTF), peptidoglycan 
      recognition protein 1 and IL-18 receptor accessory protein (IL18RAP) remained 
      significantly elevated in peripheral monocytes of hypertensive individuals in a 
      separate validation cohort. Interestingly, IL18RAP expression associated with MAP 
      in a cohort of African Americans. Furthermore, homozygosity for a missense single 
      nucleotide polymorphism in LTF that decreases antimicrobial function and 
      increases protein levels (rs1126478) was over-represented in patients with 
      hypertension relative to controls (odds ratio 1.16). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: These data demonstrate that monocytes exhibit enhanced 
      pro-inflammatory gene expression in hypertensive individuals and identify IL18RAP 
      and LTF as potential novel mediators of human hypertension. LINKED ARTICLES: This

AB  - The Wheat@URGI portal has been developed to provide the international community 
      of researchers and breeders with access to the bread wheat reference genome 
      sequence produced by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium. Genome 
      browsers, BLAST, and InterMine tools have been established for in-depth 
      exploration of the genome sequence together with additional linked datasets 
      including physical maps, sequence variations, gene expression, and genetic and 
      phenomic data from other international collaborative projects already stored in 
      the GnpIS information system. The portal provides enhanced search and browser 
      features that will facilitate the deployment of the latest genomics resources in 
      wheat improvement.

TI  - Morphological Characterization of Root System Architecture in Diverse Tomato 
      Genotypes during Early Growth.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19123888 [doi]
LID - 3888
AB  - Plant roots exploit morphological plasticity to adapt and respond to different 
      soil environments. We characterized the root system architecture of nine wild 
      tomato species and four cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) varieties 
      during early growth in a controlled environment. Additionally, the root system 
      architecture of six near-isogenic lines from the tomato 'Micro-Tom' mutant 
      collection was also studied. These lines were affected in key genes of ethylene, 
      abscisic acid, and anthocyanin pathways. We found extensive differences between 
      the studied lines for a number of meaningful morphological traits, such as 
      lateral root distribution, lateral root length or adventitious root development, 
      which might represent adaptations to local soil conditions during speciation and 
      subsequent domestication. Taken together, our results provide a general 
      quantitative framework for comparing root system architecture in tomato seedlings 
      and other related species.

TI  - Racial disparities in bipolar disorder treatment and research: a call to action.
PG  - 506-514
LID - 10.1111/bdi.12638 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Health disparities between individuals of African and European 
      ancestry are well documented. The disparities in bipolar disorder may be driven 
      by racial bias superimposed on established factors contributing to misdiagnosis, 
      including: evolving empirically based diagnostic criteria (International 
      Classification of Diseases [ICD], Research Diagnostic Criteria [RDC] and 
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual [DSM]), multiple symptom domains (i.e. mania, 
      depression and psychosis), and multimodal medical and additional psychiatric 
      comorbidity. METHODS: For this paper, we reviewed the phenomenological 
      differences between bipolar individuals of African and European ancestry in the 
      context of diagnostic criteria and clinical factors that may contribute to a 
      potential racial bias. RESULTS: Published data show that bipolar persons of 
      African ancestry, compared with bipolar persons of non-African ancestry, are more 
      often misdiagnosed with a disease other than bipolar disorder (i.e. 
      schizophrenia). Additionally, studies show that there are disparities in 
      recruiting patients of African ancestry to participate in important genomic 
      studies. This gap in biological research in this underrepresented minority may 
      represent a missed opportunity to address potential racial differences in the 
      risk and course of bipolar illness. CONCLUSION: A concerted effort by the 
      research community to increase inclusion of diverse persons in studies of bipolar 
      disorder through community engagement may facilitate fully addressing these 
      diagnostic and treatment disparities in bipolar individuals of African ancestry.

TI  - PhenoDis: a comprehensive database for phenotypic characterization of rare 
      cardiac diseases.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/s13023-018-0765-y [doi]
LID - 22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thoroughly annotated data resources are a key requirement in 
      phenotype dependent analysis and diagnosis of diseases in the area of precision 
      medicine. Recent work has shown that curation and systematic annotation of human 
      phenome data can significantly improve the quality and selectivity for the 
      interpretation of inherited diseases. We have therefore developed PhenoDis, a 
      comprehensive, manually annotated database providing symptomatic, genetic and 
      imprinting information about rare cardiac diseases. RESULTS: PhenoDis includes 
      214 rare cardiac diseases from Orphanet and 94 more from OMIM. For phenotypic 
      characterization of the diseases, we performed manual annotation of diseases with 
      articles from the biomedical literature. Detailed description of disease symptoms 
      required the use of 2247 different terms from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). 
      Diseases listed in PhenoDis frequently cover a broad spectrum of symptoms with 
      28% from the branch of 'cardiovascular abnormality' and others from areas such as 
      neurological (11.5%) and metabolism (6%). We collected extensive information on 
      the frequency of symptoms in respective diseases as well as on disease-associated 
      genes and imprinting data. The analysis of the abundance of symptoms in patient 
      studies revealed that most of the annotated symptoms (71%) are found in less than 
      half of the patients of a particular disease. Comprehensive and systematic 
      characterization of symptoms including their frequency is a pivotal prerequisite 
      for computer based prediction of diseases and disease causing genetic variants. 
      To this end, PhenoDis provides in-depth annotation for a complete group of rare 
      diseases, including information on pathogenic and likely pathogenic genetic 
      variants for 206 diseases as listed in ClinVar. We integrated all results in an 
      online database ( http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/phenodis/ ) with multiple 
      search options and provide the complete dataset for download. CONCLUSION: 
      PhenoDis provides a comprehensive set of manually annotated rare cardiac diseases 
      that enables computational approaches for disease prediction via decision support 
      systems and phenotype-driven strategies for the identification of disease causing 
      genes.
