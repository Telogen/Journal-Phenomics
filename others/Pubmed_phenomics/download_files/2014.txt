TI  - Meta-analysis of correlated traits via summary statistics from GWASs with an 
      application in hypertension.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many genetic variants 
      underlying complex traits. Many detected genetic loci harbor variants that 
      associate with multiple-even distinct-traits. Most current analysis approaches 
      focus on single traits, even though the final results from multiple traits are 
      evaluated together. Such approaches miss the opportunity to systemically 
      integrate the phenome-wide data available for genetic association analysis. In 
      this study, we propose a general approach that can integrate association evidence 
      from summary statistics of multiple traits, either correlated, independent, 
      continuous, or binary traits, which might come from the same or different 
      studies. We allow for trait heterogeneity effects. Population structure and 
      cryptic relatedness can also be controlled. Our simulations suggest that the 
      proposed method has improved statistical power over single-trait analysis in most 
      of the cases we studied. We applied our method to the Continental Origins and 
      Genetic Epidemiology Network (COGENT) African ancestry samples for three blood 
      pressure traits and identified four loci (CHIC2, HOXA-EVX1, IGFBP1/IGFBP3, and 
      CDH17; p < 5.0 × 10(-8)) associated with hypertension-related traits that were 
      missed by a single-trait analysis in the original report. Six additional loci 
      with suggestive association evidence (p < 5.0 × 10(-7)) were also observed, 
      including CACNA1D and WNT3. Our study strongly suggests that analyzing multiple 
      phenotypes can improve statistical power and that such analysis can be executed 
      with the summary statistics from GWASs. Our method also provides a way to study a 
      cross phenotype (CP) association by using summary statistics from GWASs of 
      multiple phenotypes.

      Saccharomyces cerevisiae].
PG  - 368-80
AB  - Industrial microorganisms are subject to various stress conditions, including 
      products and substrates inhibitions. Therefore, improvement of stress tolerance 
      is of great importance for industrial microbial production. Acetic acid is one of 
      the major inhibitors in the cellulosic hydrolysates, which affects seriously on 
      cell growth and metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Studies on the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying adaptive response and tolerance of acetic acid of S. 
      cerevisiae benefit breeding of robust strains of industrial yeast for more 
      efficient production. In recent years, more insights into the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying acetic acid tolerance have been revealed through analysis 
      of global gene expression and metabolomics analysis, as well as phenomics 
      analysis by single gene deletion libraries. Novel genes related to response to 
      acetic acid and improvement of acetic acid tolerance have been identified, and 
      novel strains with improved acetic acid tolerance were constructed by modifying 
      key genes. Metal ions including potassium and zinc play important roles in acetic 
      acid tolerance in S. cerevisiae, and the effect of zinc was first discovered in 
      our previous studies on flocculating yeast. Genes involved in cell wall 
      remodeling, membrane transport, energy metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis and 
      transport, as well as global transcription regulation were discussed. Exploration 
      and modification of the molecular mechanisms of yeast acetic acid tolerance will 
      be done further on levels such as post-translational modifications and synthetic 
      biology and engineering; and the knowledge obtained will pave the way for 
      breeding robust strains for more efficient bioconversion of cellulosic materials 
      to produce biofuels and bio-based chemicals.

TI  - CYP3A5 polymorphism, amlodipine and hypertension.
PG  - 145-9
LID - 10.1038/jhh.2013.67 [doi]
AB  - As a major cardiovascular risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease, heart 
      failure and end-stage renal disease, hypertension affects approximately one 
      billion people and causes large economic burden worldwide. Cytochrome P450 3A5 
      (CYP3A5), belonging to the CYP3A subfamily, has been implicated in the regulation 
      of blood pressure and may serve as a potential risk factor for the development of 
      hypertension. Increased CYP3A5 activity could cause sodium and water retention by 
      affecting the metabolism of cortisol in the kidneys. Furthermore, polymorphic 
      CYP3A5 genotypes have been shown to cause differences in blood pressure response 
      to antihypertensive drugs. Several studies have investigated the role of CYP3A5 
      in blood pressure response to amlodipine. However, recent data on the role of 
      CYP3A5 in hypertension development and treatment are inconsistent. This review 
      summarizes what is known regarding the relationship of CYP3A5 with hypertension, 
      discusses the limitations in present studies, highlights the gaps and directs 
      research to this field.

TI  - Dental phenomics: advancing genotype to phenotype correlations in craniofacial 
      research.
PG  - 34-47
LID - 10.1111/adj.12156 [doi]
AB  - The field of dental phenomics provides many opportunities to elucidate the roles 
      of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors in craniofacial development. To 
      date, research findings have helped to clarify the pathogenesis of many 
      conditions, aiding diagnosis and clinical management. This paper provides an 
      overview of dental phenomics research in some commonly encountered oral diseases 
      in everyday clinical practice, as well as research relating to craniofacial 
      growth and development. Clinically, advances in cariology and periodontology have 
      led to better diagnostic capabilities and treatment provision. In the study of 
      growth and development, important information regarding the varying clinical 
      presentation and pathogenesis of many disorders is now apparent through the 
      accurate quantification of phenotypes. Improvements in two-dimensional (2D) and 
      three-dimensional (3D) imaging and analytical techniques have allowed for 
      accurate dental phenotyping, and efforts are ongoing to apply these in vitro 
      techniques to the in vivo setting. The field of dental phenomics represents an 
      exciting avenue that links research findings to practical application, and 
      collaboration between researcher and clinicians will help advance the field 
      further.

TI  - Phenome-wide association studies (PheWASs) for functional variants.
PG  - 523-9
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2014.123 [doi]
AB  - The genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a powerful approach for studying the 
      genetic complexities of human disease. Unfortunately, GWASs often fail to 
      identify clinically significant associations and describing function can be a 
      challenge. GWAS is a phenotype-to-genotype approach. It is now possible to 
      conduct a converse genotype-to-phenotype approach using extensive electronic 
      medical records to define a phenome. This approach associates a single genetic 
      variant with many phenotypes across the phenome and is called a phenome-wide 
      association study (PheWAS). The majority of PheWASs conducted have focused on 
      variants identified previously by GWASs. This approach has been efficient for 
      rediscovering gene-disease associations while also identifying pleiotropic 
      effects for some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, the use of SNPs 
      identified by GWAS in a PheWAS is limited by the inherent properties of the GWAS 
      SNPs, including weak effect sizes and difficulty when translating discoveries to 
      function. To address these challenges, we conducted a PheWAS on 105 presumed 
      functional stop-gain and stop-loss variants genotyped on 4235 Marshfield Clinic 
      patients. Associations were validated on an additional 10 640 Marshfield Clinic 
      patients. PheWAS results indicate that a nonsense variant in ARMS2 (rs2736911) is 
      associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). These results demonstrate 
      that focusing on functional variants may be an effective approach when conducting 
      a PheWAS.

AB  - Information about a gene sometimes can be deduced by examining the impact of its 
      mutation on phenotype. However, the genome-scale utility of the method is limited 
      because, for nearly all model organisms, the majority of mutations result in 
      little or no observable phenotypic impact. The cause of this is often attributed 
      to robustness or redundancy within the genome, but that is only one plausible 
      hypothesis. We examined a standard set of phenotypic traits, and applied 
      statistical methods commonly used in the study of natural variants to an 
      engineered mutant strain collection representing disruptions in 180 of the 192 
      ABC transporters within the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. These strains display 
      continuous variation in their phenotypic distributions, with a small number of 
      "outlier" strains at both phenotypic extremes, and the majority within a 
      confidence interval about the mean that always includes wild type. Correlation 
      analysis reveals substantial pleiotropy, indicating that the traits do not 
      represent independent variables. The traits measured in this study co-cluster 
      with expression profiles, thereby demonstrating that these changes in phenotype 
      correspond to changes at the molecular level, and therefore can be indirectly 
      connected to changes in the genome. However, the continuous distributions, the 
      pleiotropy, and the placement of wild type always within the confidence interval 
      all indicate that this standard set of M. xanthus phenotypic assays is measuring 
      a narrow range of partially overlapping traits that do not directly reflect 
      fitness. This is likely a significant cause of the observed small phenotypic 
      impact from mutation, and is unrelated to robustness and redundancy.

TI  - dRiskKB: a large-scale disease-disease risk relationship knowledge base 
      constructed from biomedical text.
PG  - 105
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-15-105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Discerning the genetic contributions to complex human diseases is a 
      challenging mandate that demands new types of data and calls for new avenues for 
      advancing the state-of-the-art in computational approaches to uncovering disease 
      etiology. Systems approaches to studying observable phenotypic relationships 
      among diseases are emerging as an active area of research for both novel disease 
      gene discovery and drug repositioning. Currently, systematic study of disease 
      relationships on a phenome-wide scale is limited due to the lack of large-scale 
      machine understandable disease phenotype relationship knowledge bases. Our study 
      innovates a semi-supervised iterative pattern learning approach that is used to 
      build an precise, large-scale disease-disease risk relationship (D1 → D2) 
      knowledge base (dRiskKB) from a vast corpus of free-text published biomedical 
      literature. RESULTS: 21,354,075 MEDLINE records comprised the text corpus under 
      study. First, we used one typical disease risk-specific syntactic pattern (i.e. 
      "D1 due to D2") as a seed to automatically discover other patterns specifying 
      similar semantic relationships among diseases. We then extracted D1 → D2 risk 
      pairs from MEDLINE using the learned patterns. We manually evaluated the 
      precisions of the learned patterns and extracted pairs. Finally, we analyzed the 
      correlations between disease-disease risk pairs and their associated genes and 
      drugs. The newly created dRiskKB consists of a total of 34,448 unique D1 → D2 
      pairs, representing the risk-specific semantic relationships among 12,981 
      diseases with each disease linked to its associated genes and drugs. The 
      identified patterns are highly precise (average precision of 0.99) in specifying 
      the risk-specific relationships among diseases. The precisions of extracted pairs 
      are 0.919 for those that are exactly matched and 0.988 for those that are 
      partially matched. By comparing the iterative pattern approach starting from 
      different seeds, we demonstrated that our algorithm is robust in terms of seed 
      choice. We show that diseases and their risk diseases as well as diseases with 
      similar risk profiles tend to share both genes and drugs. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      unique dRiskKB, when combined with existing phenotypic, genetic, and genomic 
      datasets, can have profound implications in our deeper understanding of disease 
      etiology and in drug repositioning.

AB  - With the continuous improvement in genotyping and molecular phenotyping 
      technology and the decreasing typing cost, it is expected that in a few years, 
      more and more clinical studies of complex diseases will recruit thousands of 
      individuals for pan-omic genetic association analyses. Hence, there is a great 
      need for algorithms and software tools that could scale up to the whole omic 
      level, integrate different omic data, leverage rich structure information, and be 
      easily accessible to non-technical users. We present GenAMap, an interactive 
      analytics software platform that 1) automates the execution of principled machine 
      learning methods that detect genome- and phenome-wide associations among 
      genotypes, gene expression data, and clinical or other macroscopic traits, and 2) 
      provides new visualization tools specifically designed to aid in the exploration 
      of association mapping results. Algorithmically, GenAMap is based on a new 
      paradigm for GWAS and PheWAS analysis, termed structured association mapping, 
      which leverages various structures in the omic data. We demonstrate the function 
      of GenAMap via a case study of the Brem and Kruglyak yeast dataset, and then 
      apply it on a comprehensive eQTL analysis of the NIH heterogeneous stock mice 
      dataset and report some interesting findings. GenAMap is available from 
      http://sailing.cs.cmu.edu/genamap.

TI  - Leaf phenomics: a systematic reverse genetic screen for Arabidopsis leaf mutants.
PG  - 878-91
LID - 10.1111/tpj.12595 [doi]
AB  - The study and eventual manipulation of leaf development in plants requires a 
      thorough understanding of the genetic basis of leaf organogenesis. Forward 
      genetic screens have identified hundreds of Arabidopsis mutants with altered leaf 
      development, but the genome has not yet been saturated. To identify genes 
      required for leaf development we are screening the Arabidopsis Salk Unimutant 
      collection. We have identified 608 lines that exhibit a leaf phenotype with full 
      penetrance and almost constant expressivity and 98 additional lines with 
      segregating mutant phenotypes. To allow indexing and integration with other 
      mutants, the mutant phenotypes were described using a custom leaf phenotype 
      ontology. We found that the indexed mutation is present in the annotated locus 
      for 78% of the 553 mutants genotyped, and that in half of these the annotated 
      T-DNA is responsible for the phenotype. To quickly map non-annotated T-DNA 
      insertions, we developed a reliable, cost-effective and easy method based on 
      whole-genome sequencing. To enable comprehensive access to our data, we 
      implemented a public web application named PhenoLeaf 
      (http://genetics.umh.es/phenoleaf) that allows researchers to query the results 
      of our screen, including text and visual phenotype information. We demonstrated 
      how this new resource can facilitate gene function discovery by identifying and 
      characterizing At1g77600, which we found to be required for proximal-distal cell

AB  - Malaria plagues one out of every 30 humans and contributes to almost a million 
      deaths, and the problem could worsen. Our current therapeutic options are 
      compromised by emerging resistance by the parasite to our front line drugs. It is 
      thus imperative to better understand the basic biology of the parasite and 
      develop novel drugs to stem this disease. The most facile approach to analyse a 
      gene's function is to remove it from the genome or inhibit its activity. Although 
      genetic manipulation of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is a 
      relatively standard procedure, there is no optimal method to perturb genes 
      essential to the intraerythrocytic development cycle--the part of the life cycle 
      that produces the clinical manifestation of malaria. This is a severe impediment 
      to progress because the phenotype we wish to study is exactly the one that is so 
      elusive. In the absence of any utilitarian way to conditionally delete essential 
      genes, we are prevented from investigating the parasite's most vulnerable points. 
      This review aims to focus on the development of tools identifying essential genes 
      of P. falciparum and our ability to elicit phenotypic mutation.

AB  - Our aim was to uncover unrecognized phenomic relationships using force-based 
      network visualization methods, based on observed electronic medical record data. 
      A primary phenotype was defined from actual patient profiles in the 
      Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II database. Network 
      visualizations depicting primary relationships were compared to those 
      incorporating secondary adjacencies. Interactivity was enabled through a 
      phenotype visualization software concept: the Phenomics Advisor. Subendocardial 
      infarction with cardiac arrest was demonstrated as a sample phenotype; there were 
      332 primarily adjacent diagnoses, with 5423 relationships. Primary network 
      visualization suggested a treatment-related complication phenotype and several 
      rare diagnoses; re-clustering by secondary relationships revealed an emergent 
      cluster of smokers with the metabolic syndrome. Network visualization reveals 
      phenotypic patterns that may have remained occult in pairwise correlation 
      analysis. Visualization of complex data, potentially offered as point-of-care 
      tools on mobile devices, may allow clinicians and researchers to quickly generate 
      hypotheses and gain deeper understanding of patient subpopulations.

TI  - Consequences of the recurrent MYD88(L265P) somatic mutation for B cell tolerance.
PG  - 413-26
LID - 10.1084/jem.20131424 [doi]
AB  - MYD88(L265P) has recently been discovered as an extraordinarily frequent somatic 
      mutation in benign monoclonal IgM gammopathy, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, 
      and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. In this study, we analyze the consequences for 
      antigen-activated primary B cells of acquiring MYD88(L265P). The mutation induced 
      rapid B cell division in the absence of exogenous TLR ligands and was inhibited 
      by Unc93b1(3d) mutation and chloroquine or TLR9 deficiency, indicating continued 
      dependence on upstream TLR9 activation. Proliferation and NF-κB activation 
      induced by MYD88(L265P) were nevertheless rapidly countered by the induction of 
      TNFAIP3, an NF-κB inhibitor frequently inactivated in MYD88(L265P)-bearing 
      lymphomas, and extinguished by Bim-dependent apoptosis. MYD88(L265P) caused 
      self-reactive B cells to accumulate in vivo only when apoptosis was opposed by 
      Bcl2 overexpression. These results reveal checkpoints that fortify TLR responses 
      against aberrant B cell proliferation in response to ubiquitous TLR and BCR 
      self-ligands and suggest that tolerance failure requires the accumulation of 
      multiple somatic mutations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To harmonize the collection of nonsurgical clinical and epidemiologic 
      data relevant to endometriosis research, allowing large-scale collaboration. 
      DESIGN: An international collaboration involving 34 clinical/academic centers and 
      three industry collaborators from 16 countries on five continents. SETTING: In 
      2013, two workshops followed by global consultation, bringing together 54 leaders 
      in endometriosis research. PATIENTS: None. INTERVENTION(S): Development of a 
      self-administered endometriosis patient questionnaire (EPQ), based on [1] 
      systematic comparison of questionnaires from eight centers that collect data from 
      endometriosis cases (and controls/comparison women) on a medium to large scale 
      (publication on >100 cases); [2] literature evidence; and [3] several global 
      consultation rounds. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Standard recommended and minimum 
      required questionnaires to capture detailed clinical and covariate data. 
      RESULT(S): The standard recommended (EPHect EPQ-S) and minimum required (EPHect 
      EPQ-M) questionnaires contain questions on pelvic pain, subfertility and 
      menstrual/reproductive history, hormone/medication use, medical history, and 
      personal information. CONCLUSION(S): The EPQ captures the basic set of patient 
      characteristics and exposures considered by the WERF EPHect Working Group to be 
      most critical for the advancement of endometriosis research, but is also relevant 
      to other female conditions with similar risk factors and/or symptomatology. The 
      instruments will be reviewed based on feedback from investigators, and-after a 
      first review after 1 year-triannually through systematic follow-up surveys. 
      Updated versions will be made available through

TI  - Stress indicators based on airborne thermal imagery for field phenotyping a 
      heterogeneous tree population for response to water constraints.
PG  - 5429-42
LID - 10.1093/jxb/eru309 [doi]
AB  - As field phenotyping of plant response to water constraints constitutes a 
      bottleneck for breeding programmes, airborne thermal imagery can contribute to 
      assessing the water status of a wide range of individuals simultaneously. 
      However, the presence of mixed soil-plant pixels in heterogeneous plant cover 
      complicates the interpretation of canopy temperature. Moran's Water Deficit Index 
      (WDI = 1-ETact/ETmax), which was designed to overcome this difficulty, was 
      compared with surface minus air temperature (T s-T a) as a water stress 
      indicator. As parameterization of the theoretical equations for WDI computation 
      is difficult, particularly when applied to genotypes with large architectural 
      variability, a simplified procedure based on quantile regression was proposed to 
      delineate the Vegetation Index-Temperature (VIT) scatterplot. The sensitivity of 
      WDI to variations in wet and dry references was assessed by applying more or less 
      stringent quantile levels. The different stress indicators tested on a series of 
      airborne multispectral images (RGB, near-infrared, and thermal infrared) of a 
      population of 122 apple hybrids, under two irrigation regimes, significantly 
      discriminated the tree water statuses. For each acquisition date, the statistical 
      method efficiently delineated the VIT scatterplot, while the limits obtained 
      using the theoretical approach overlapped it, leading to inconsistent WDI values. 
      Once water constraint was established, the different stress indicators were 
      linearly correlated to the stem water potential among a tree subset. T s-T a 
      showed a strong sensitivity to evaporative demand, which limited its relevancy 
      for temporal comparisons. Finally, the statistical approach of WDI appeared the 
      most suitable for high-throughput phenotyping.

AB  - Neuroimaging, genetics, and phenomic explorations in the study of brain aging 
      seek to characterize typical patterns of morphometric, function, and connectomics 
      and how these change over the lifespan. With a detailed but multifaceted 
      knowledge of these patterns, neuroscientists and clinicians can better recognize 
      the processes at play when age-related brain changes vary from these 
      expectations. Employing a range of neuroimaging methods, genome-wide as well as 
      focused gene targeting, and 'big data' computation, progress is occurring toward 
      gaining such understanding. We are excited to present these articles as a special 
      issue of Brain Imaging and Behavior which grew out of from our New Horizons in 
      Human Brain Imaging meeting on the theme of the neuroimaging of brain aging, held 
      in March 2013.

      will influence patient care.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1111/adj.12157 [doi]
AB  - It has been a privilege to assemble a group of Australian and international 
      researchers to produce a special issue of the Australian Dental Journal that 
      reflects the cutting edge of research in different aspects of craniofacial 
      biology, and also considers how these advances will influence future education 
      and practice within dentistry. The aim of this special issue is to provide a 
      collection of concept papers and critical reviews on key topics that cover both 
      fundamental and applied research in craniofacial biology and to consider the 
      clinical implications. To do this, four questions have been addressed that lead 
      to the four sections of this issue. These are: How have we come to the present 
      exciting position in craniofacial biology with breakthroughs over the past 50 
      years? What are current fundamental research topics that are helping us to 
      understand more about craniofacial and general development, possibly leading to 
      future clinical developments? What are the current applied research topics that 
      will influence future clinical practice? Looking forward, what new developments 
      in craniofacial biology may come about that will change the face of dental 
      education and practice? The refereed papers in this special issue are grouped 
      into the four sections that seek to respond to these demanding questions.

AB  - Sporadically, patients with a proven defect in either mFAO or OXPHOS are 
      described presenting with a metabolic profile and clinical phenotype expressing 
      concurrent defects in both pathways. Biochemical linkages between both processes 
      are tight. Therefore, it is striking that concurrent dysfunction of both systems 
      occurs so infrequent. In this review, the linkages between OXPHOS and mFAO and 
      the hypothesized processes responsible for concurrent problems in both systems 
      are reviewed, both from the point of view of primary biochemical connections and 
      secondary cellular responses, i.e. signaling pathways constituting 
      nutrient-sensing networks. We propose that affected signaling pathways may play 
      an important role in the phenomenon of concurrent defects. Recent data indicate 
      that interference in the affected signaling pathways may resolve the pathological 
      phenotype even though the primary enzyme deficiency persists. This offers new 
      (unexpected) prospects for treatment of these inborn errors of metabolism. This 
      article is part of a Special Issue entitled: From Genome to Function.

AB  - This overview and data-based example indicate how large families of recombinant 
      inbred (RI) strains can be used to identify genetic loci and genes that underlie 
      complex phenotypic differences among inbred mice. The RI approach requires no a 
      priori expectations or assumptions about mechanisms that influence the phenotype, 
      other than that variability is partly heritable. RI strains, which are produced 
      by inbreeding the F2 progeny of two parental strains for at least 20 generations, 
      have two major advantages. First, numerous subjects with identical genotypes can 
      be analyzed to determine the average phenotype associated with that genotype, and 
      second, it becomes practical to systematically accumulate large genome and 
      phenome data sets for entire RI families, including sequence data, transcriptomes 
      for many organs, and cell types and extensive data on gene-by-pathogen 
      interactions. This enables the construction of far more sophisticated models of 
      disease cause and progression. To illustrate the use of the systems genetics 
      approach to infectious disease, we designed a simple study using three 
      complementary families of RI strains (CXB, BXD, and AXB/BXA) that are 
      differentially susceptible to intravenous challenge with the yeast Candida 
      albicans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of predictors of treatment response holds 
      tremendous potential for the improvement of clinical outcomes in bipolar disorder 
      (BP). The goal of this project is to evaluate the test-retest reliability of a 
      new clinical tool, the Lithium Questionnaire (LQ), for the retrospective 
      assessment of long-term lithium use in research participants with BP. METHODS: 
      Twenty-nine individuals with BP-I (n=27), major depression (n=1), or 
      schizoaffective disorder (n=1) were recruited for participation. The LQ was 
      administered to all participants at two time-points, spaced 17 months apart on 
      average, and used to determine each subject׳s score on the Retrospective Criteria 
      of Long-Term Treatment Response in Research Subjects with Bipolar Disorder Scale, 
      or the Alda Scale. Scores were confirmed through a best-estimate procedure, and 
      test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC]) of the LQ was 
      calculated. RESULTS: The correlation between the total Alda Scale scores at the 
      two time-points was in the moderate range (ICC=0.60). Relevant clinical factors 
      such as age or presence of Axis I psychiatric comorbidity did not influence the 
      reliability. LIMITATIONS: The validity of the LQ was not examined. Inclusion of 
      two participants with non-BP diagnoses may have affected the LQ׳s reliability, 
      but re-analysis of our data after exclusion of these participants did not 
      influence the reliability. The absence of measures of mood and cognition at time 
      of LQ may be a limitation of this work. CONCLUSIONS: The LQ holds promise for the 
      standardization of the retrospective assessment of long-term treatment in BP.

TI  - Functional characterization of breast cancer using pathway profiles.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1186/1755-8794-7-45 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The molecular characteristics of human diseases are often represented 
      by a list of genes termed "signature genes". A significant challenge facing this 
      approach is that of reproducibility: signatures developed on a set of patients 
      may fail to perform well on different sets of patients. As diseases are resulted 
      from perturbed cellular functions, irrespective of the particular genes that 
      contribute to the function, it may be more appropriate to characterize diseases 
      based on these perturbed cellular functions. METHODS: We proposed a profile-based 
      approach to characterize a disease using a binary vector whose elements indicate 
      whether a given function is perturbed based on the enrichment analysis of 
      expression data between normal and tumor tissues. Using breast cancer and its 
      four primary clinically relevant subtypes as examples, this approach is evaluated 
      based on the reproducibility, accuracy and resolution of the resulting pathway 
      profiles. RESULTS: Pathway profiles for breast cancer and its subtypes are 
      constructed based on data obtained from microarray and RNA-Seq data sets provided 
      by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and an additional microarray data set provided 
      by The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA). An average reproducibility of 68% 
      is achieved between different data sets (TCGA microarray vs. EGA microarray data) 
      and 67% average reproducibility is achieved between different technologies (TCGA 
      microarray vs. TCGA RNA-Seq data). Among the enriched pathways, 74% of them are 
      known to be associated with breast cancer or other cancers. About 40% of the 
      identified pathways are enriched in all four subtypes, with 4, 2, 4, and 7 
      pathways enriched only in luminal A, luminal B, triple-negative, and HER2+ 
      subtypes, respectively. Comparison of profiles between subtypes, as well as other 
      diseases, shows that luminal A and luminal B subtypes are more similar to the 
      HER2+ subtype than to the triple-negative subtype, and subtypes of breast cancer 
      are more likely to be closer to each other than to other diseases. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our results demonstrate that pathway profiles can successfully characterize both 
      common and distinct functional characteristics of four subtypes of breast cancer 
      and other related diseases, with acceptable reproducibility, high accuracy and 
      reasonable resolution.

TI  - Phenomic networks reveal largely independent root and shoot adjustment in 
      waterlogged plants of Lotus japonicus.
PG  - 2278-93
LID - 10.1111/pce.12268 [doi]
AB  - Waterlogging imposes severe stress to the plant, and the interplay between root 
      and aerial organs in the adjustment to this stress is poorly understood. A set of 
      recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Lotus japonicus (Gifu B-129 × Miyakojima 
      MG-20) was subjected to control and waterlogging conditions for 21 d, and 12 
      traits related to leaf physiological functioning, root aerenchyma formation, 
      shoot and root morphology, and dry mass accumulation were assessed to generate 
      phenomic networks. The phenomic network became more complex under waterlogging as 
      a result of the incorporation of root aerenchyma and dark-adapted Fv/Fm. 
      Significant waterlogging-induced variation was found for stomatal conductance, 
      dark-adapted Fv/Fm and aerenchyma. The RILs with stronger induction of aerenchyma 
      in response to waterlogging tended to show reduced negative impact of this stress 
      on root growth but suffered average impact on shoot growth. The RILs that 
      retained higher stomatal conductance under waterlogging tended to retain higher 
      dark-adapted Fv/Fm and shoot growth under waterlogging conditions but showed 
      average impact on root traits. We propose a model where, although the stress 
      experienced by the roots during waterlogging is transmitted to the shoot, shoots 
      and roots deal with waterlogging in a less interdependent manner than often 
      assumed.

AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is emerging as a new important species for studying 
      mechanisms of brain function and dysfunction. Focusing on selected central 
      nervous system (CNS) disorders (brain cancer, epilepsy, and anxiety) and using 
      them as examples, we discuss the value of zebrafish models in translational 
      neuroscience. We further evaluate the contribution of zebrafish to neuroimaging, 
      circuit level, and drug discovery research. Outlining the role of zebrafish in 
      modeling a wide range of human brain disorders, we also summarize recent 
      applications and existing challenges in this field. Finally, we emphasize the 
      potential of zebrafish models in behavioral phenomics and high-throughput 
      genetic/small molecule screening, which is critical for CNS drug discovery and 
      identifying novel candidate genes.

AB  - Thanks to the discovery of novel technologies and sophisticated analysis tools we 
      can now 'see' molecules, genes and even patterns of gene expression, which have 
      resulted in major advances in many areas of biology. Recently, similar 
      technologies have been developed for behavioral studies. However, the wide 
      implementation of such technological progress in behavioral research remains 
      behind, as if there are inhibiting factors for accepting and adopting available 
      innovations. The methods of the majority of studies measuring and interpreting 
      behavior of laboratory animals seem to have frozen in time somewhere in the last 
      century. As an example of the so-called classical tests, we will present the 
      history and shortcomings of one of the most frequently used tests, the open 
      field. Similar objections and critical remarks, however, can be made with regard 
      to the elevated plus maze, light-dark box, various other mazes, object 
      recognition tests, etc. Possible solutions and recommendations on how progress in 
      behavioral neuroscience can be achieved and accelerated will be discussed in the 
      second part of this review.

AB  - The progress in phenotype descriptions, measurements, and analyses has been 
      remarkable in the last 50 years. Biomarkers (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, 
      hormones, various RNAs and cDNAs, microarrays) have been discovered and 
      correlated with diseases and disorders, as well as physiological responses to 
      disease, injury, stress, within blood, urine, and saliva. Three-dimensional 
      digital imaging advanced how we "see" and utilize phenotypes toward diagnosis, 
      treatment, and prognosis. In each example, scientific discovery led to inform 
      clinical health care. In tandem, genetics evolved from Mendelian inheritance 
      (single gene mutations) to include Complex Human Diseases (multiple gene-gene and 
      gene-environment interactions). In addition, epigenetics blossomed with new 
      insights about gene modifiers (e.g., histone and non-histone chromosomal protein 
      methylation, acetylation, sulfation, phosphorylation). We are now at the 
      beginning of a new era using human and microbial whole-genome sequencing to make 
      significant healthcare decisions as to risk, stratification of patients, 
      diagnosis, treatments, and outcomes. Are we as clinicians, scientists, and 
      educators prepared to expand our scope of practice, knowledge base, integration 
      into primary health care (medicine, pharmacy, nursing, and allied health science 
      professions), and clinical approaches to craniofacial-oral-dental health care? 
      The time is now.

AB  - The characteristics of holistic, dynamics, complexity, and spatial and temporal 
      features enable "Omics" and theories of TCM to interlink with each other. HPO, 
      namely, "characterization," can be understood as a sorting and generalization of 
      the manifestations shown by people with diseases on the basis of the phenomics. 
      Syndrome is the overall "manifestation" of human body pathological and 
      physiological changes expressed by four diagnostic methods' information. The four 
      diagnostic methods' data could be the most objective and direct manifestations of 
      human body under morbid conditions. In this aspect, it is consistent with the 
      connation of "characterization." Meanwhile, the four diagnostic methods' data 
      also equip us with features of characterization in HPO. In our study, we compared 
      107 pieces of four diagnostic methods' information with the "characterization 
      database" to further analyze data of four diagnostic methods' characterization in 
      accordance with the common characteristics of four diagnostic methods' 
      information and characterization and integrated 107 pieces of four diagnostic 
      methods' data to relevant items in HPO and finished the expansion of 
      characterization information in HPO.

PG  - D743-50
LID - 10.1093/nar/gku1026 [doi]
AB  - The Rat Genome Database (RGD, http://rgd.mcw.edu) provides the most comprehensive 
      data repository and informatics platform related to the laboratory rat, one of 
      the most important model organisms for disease studies. RGD maintains and updates 
      datasets for genomic elements such as genes, transcripts and increasingly in 
      recent years, sequence variations, as well as map positions for multiple 
      assemblies and sequence information. Functional annotations for genomic elements 
      are curated from published literature, submitted by researchers and integrated 
      from other public resources. Complementing the genomic data catalogs are those 
      associated with phenotypes and disease, including strains, QTL and experimental 
      phenotype measurements across hundreds of strains. Data are submitted by 
      researchers, acquired through bulk data pipelines or curated from published 
      literature. Innovative software tools provide users with an integrated platform 
      to query, mine, display and analyze valuable genomic and phenomic datasets for 
      discovery and enhancement of their own research. This update highlights recent 
      developments that reflect an increasing focus on: (i) genomic variation, (ii) 
      phenotypes and diseases, (iii) data related to the environment and experimental 
      conditions and (iv) datasets and software tools that allow the user to explore 
      and analyze the interactions among these and their impact on disease.

PG  - 209-14
LID - 10.4137/BBI.S19057 [doi]
AB  - Biological enrichment analysis using gene ontology (GO) provides a global 
      overview of the functional role of genes or proteins identified from large-scale 
      genomic or proteomic experiments. Phenomic enrichment analysis of gene lists can 
      provide an important layer of information as well as cellular components, 
      molecular functions, and biological processes associated with gene lists. Plant 
      phenomic enrichment analysis will be useful for performing new experiments to 
      better understand plant systems and for the interpretation of gene or proteins 
      identified from high-throughput experiments. Plant ontology (PO) is a compendium 
      of terms to define the diverse phenotypic characteristics of plant species, 
      including plant anatomy, morphology, and development stages. Adoption of this 
      highly useful ontology is limited, when compared to GO, because of the lack of 
      user-friendly tools that enable the use of PO for statistical enrichment 
      analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce Plant Ontology Enrichment 
      Analysis Server (POEAS) in the public domain. POEAS uses a simple list of genes 
      as input data and performs enrichment analysis using Ontologizer 2.0 to provide 
      results in two levels, enrichment results and visualization utilities, to 
      generate ontological graphs that are of publication quality. POEAS also offers 
      interactive options to identify user-defined background population sets, various 
      multiple-testing correction methods, different enrichment calculation methods, 
      and resampling tests to improve statistical significance. The availability of 
      such a tool to perform phenomic enrichment analyses using plant genes as a 
      complementary resource will permit the adoption of PO-based phenomic analysis as 
      part of analytical workflows. POEAS can be accessed using the URL 
      http://caps.ncbs.res.in/poeas.

TI  - A genome- and phenome-wide association study to identify genetic variants 
      influencing platelet count and volume and their pleiotropic effects.
PG  - 95-109
LID - 10.1007/s00439-013-1355-7 [doi]
AB  - Platelets are enucleated cell fragments derived from megakaryocytes that play key 
      roles in hemostasis and in the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis and cancer. 
      Platelet traits are highly heritable and identification of genetic variants 
      associated with platelet traits and assessing their pleiotropic effects may help 
      to understand the role of underlying biological pathways. We conducted an 
      electronic medical record (EMR)-based study to identify common variants that 
      influence inter-individual variation in the number of circulating platelets (PLT) 
      and mean platelet volume (MPV), by performing a genome-wide association study 
      (GWAS). We characterized genetic variants associated with MPV and PLT using 
      functional, pathway and disease enrichment analyses; we assessed pleiotropic 
      effects of such variants by performing a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) 
      with a wide range of EMR-derived phenotypes. A total of 13,582 participants in 
      the electronic MEdical Records and GEnomic network had data for PLT and 6,291 
      participants had data for MPV. We identified five chromosomal regions associated 
      with PLT and eight associated with MPV at genome-wide significance (P < 5E-8). In 
      addition, we replicated 20 SNPs [out of 56 SNPs (α: 0.05/56 = 9E-4)] influencing 
      PLT and 22 SNPs [out of 29 SNPs (α: 0.05/29 = 2E-3)] influencing MPV in a 
      published meta-analysis of GWAS of PLT and MPV. While our GWAS did not find any 
      new associations, our functional analyses revealed that genes in these regions 
      influence thrombopoiesis and encode kinases, membrane proteins, proteins involved 
      in cellular trafficking, transcription factors, proteasome complex subunits, 
      proteins of signal transduction pathways, proteins involved in megakaryocyte 
      development, and platelet production and hemostasis. PheWAS using a single-SNP 
      Bonferroni correction for 1,368 diagnoses (0.05/1368 = 3.6E-5) revealed that 
      several variants in these genes have pleiotropic associations with myocardial 
      infarction, autoimmune, and hematologic disorders. We conclude that multiple 
      genetic loci influence interindividual variation in platelet traits and also have 
      significant pleiotropic effects; the related genes are in multiple functional 
      pathways including those relevant to thrombopoiesis.

AB  - Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous 
      syndrome, with several underlying etiologic and pathophysiologic factors. The 
      heterogeneity of the HFpEF syndrome may explain why (1) diagnosing and treating 
      HFpEF is so challenging and (2) clinical trials in HFpEF have failed thus far. 
      Here we describe 4 ways of categorizing HFpEF based on pathophysiology, 
      clinical/etiologic subtype, type of clinical presentation, and quantitative 
      phenomics (phenomapping analysis). Regardless of the classification method used, 
      improved phenotypic characterization of HFpEF, and matching targeted therapies 
      with specific HFpEF subtypes, will be a critical step towards improving outcomes 
      in this increasingly prevalent syndrome.

TI  - Clinical pertinence metric enables hypothesis-independent genome-phenome analysis 
      for neurologic diagnosis.
PG  - 881-8
LID - 10.1177/0883073814545884 [doi]
AB  - We describe an "integrated genome-phenome analysis" that combines both genomic 
      sequence data and clinical information for genomic diagnosis. It is novel in that 
      it uses robust diagnostic decision support and combines the clinical differential 
      diagnosis and the genomic variants using a "pertinence" metric. This allows the 
      analysis to be hypothesis-independent, not requiring assumptions about mode of 
      inheritance, number of genes involved, or which clinical findings are most 
      relevant. Using 20 genomic trios with neurologic disease, we find that pertinence 
      scores averaging 99.9% identify the causative variant under conditions in which a 
      genomic trio is analyzed and family-aware variant calling is done. The analysis 
      takes seconds, and pertinence scores can be improved by clinicians adding more 
      findings. The core conclusion is that automated genome-phenome analysis can be 
      accurate, rapid, and efficient. We also conclude that an automated process offers 
      a methodology for quality improvement of many components of genomic analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of 
      infectious diarrhea in North America and Europe. The risk of CDI increases 
      significantly in the case where antimicrobial treatment reduces the number of 
      competing bacteria in the gut, thus leading to the increased availability of 
      nutrients and loss of colonization resistance. The objective of this study was to 
      determine comprehensive nutritional utilization and the chemical sensitivity 
      profile of historic and newer C. difficile isolates and to examine the possible 
      role of the phenotype diversity in C. difficile virulence. METHODS: Phenotype 
      microarrays (PMs) were used to elucidate the complete nutritional and chemical 
      sensitivity profile of six C. difficile isolates. RESULTS: Of the 760 nutrient 
      sources tested, 285 compounds were utilized by at least one strain. Among the C. 
      difficile isolates compared, R20291, a recent hypervirulent outbreak-associated 
      strain, appears to have an expanded nutrient utilization profile when compared to 
      all other strains. CONCLUSIONS: The expanded nutritional utilization profile of 
      some newer C. difficile strains could be one of the reasons for infections in 
      patients who are not exposed to the hospital environment or not undergoing 
      antibiotic treatment. This nutritional profile could be used to design tube 
      feeding formulas that reduce the risk of CDI.

PG  - 187-208
LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-1363-3_12 [doi]
AB  - Quantitative high-throughput cell array phenotyping (Q-HTCP) is applied to the 
      genomic collection of yeast gene deletion mutants for systematic, comprehensive 
      assessment of the contribution of genes and gene combinations to any phenotype of 
      interest (phenomic analysis). Interacting gene networks influence every 
      phenotype. Genetic buffering refers to how gene interaction networks stabilize or 
      destabilize a phenotype. Like genomics, phenomics varies in its resolution with 
      there being a trade-off allocating a greater number of measurements per sample to 
      enhance quantification of the phenotype vs. increasing the number of different 
      samples by obtaining fewer measurements per sample. The Q-HTCP protocol we 
      describe assesses 50,000-70,000 cultures per experiment by obtaining kinetic 
      growth curves from time series imaging of agar cell arrays. This approach was 
      developed for the yeast gene deletion strains, but it could be applied as well to 
      other microbial mutant arrays grown on solid agar media. The methods we describe 
      are for creation and maintenance of frozen stocks, liquid source array 
      preparation, agar destination plate printing, image scanning, image analysis, 
      curve fitting, and evaluation of gene interaction.

TI  - A sustained depressive state promotes a guanfacine reversible susceptibility to 
      alcohol seeking in rats.
PG  - 1115-24
LID - 10.1038/npp.2013.311 [doi]
AB  - High rates of comorbidity between alcohol use disorder (AUD) and major depressive 
      disorder (MDD) are reported. Preclinical models examining effects of primary 
      depression on secondary AUD are currently absent, preventing adequate testing of 
      drug treatment. Here, we combined social defeat-induced persistent stress (SDPS) 
      and operant alcohol self-administration (SA) paradigms to assess causality 
      between these two neuropsychiatric disorders. We then exploited guanfacine, an 
      FDA-approved adrenergic agent reported to reduce drug craving in humans, against 
      SDPS-induced modulation of operant alcohol SA. Wistar rats were socially defeated 
      and isolated for a period of ≥9 weeks, during which depression-like 
      symptomatology (cognitive and social behavioral symptoms) was assessed. 
      Subsequently, animals were subjected to a 5-month operant alcohol SA paradigm, 
      examining acquisition, motivation, extinction, and cue-induced reinstatement of 
      alcohol seeking. The effects of guanfacine on motivation and relapse were 
      measured at >6 months following defeat. SDPS rats exhibited significant 
      disruption of social and cognitive behavior, including short-term spatial and 
      long-term social memory, several months following defeat. Notably, SDPS increased 
      motivation to obtain alcohol, and cue-induced relapse vulnerability. Guanfacine 
      reversed the SDPS-induced effects on motivation and relapse. Together, our model 
      mimics core symptomatology of a sustained depressive-like state and a subsequent 
      vulnerability to alcohol abuse. We show that SDPS is strongly associated with an 
      enhanced motivation for alcohol intake and relapse. Finally, we show that the 
      clinically employed drug guanfacine has potential as a novel treatment option in 
      comorbid patients, as it effectively reduced the enhanced sensitivity to alcohol 
      and alcohol-associated stimuli.

AB  - Living roofs are an emerging green infrastructure technology that can potentially 
      be used to ameliorate both climate change and urban heat island effects. There is 
      not much information regarding the design of green roofs for dry climates and so 
      the aim of this study was to develop low maintenance and unfertilized green roofs 
      for a dry climate. This paper describes the effects of four important elements of 
      green roofs namely slope, depth, growing media and plant species and their 
      possible interactions in terms of plant growth responses in a dry climate. 
      Sixteen medium-scale green roofs were set up and monitored during a one year 
      period. This experiment consisted of twelve vegetated platforms and four 
      non-vegetated platforms as controls. The design for the experiment was a 
      split-split-plot design in which the factors Slope (1° and 25°) and Depth (100mm, 
      300 mm) were randomized to the platforms (main plots). Root depth and volume, 
      average height of plants, final dry biomass and ground cover, relative growth 
      rate, final dry shoot-root ratio, water use efficiency and leaf succulence were 
      studied during a twelve month period. The results showed little growth of the 
      plants in media type A, whilst the growth was significant in both media types B 
      and C. On average, a 90% survival rate of plants was observed. Also the growth 
      indices indicated that some plants can grow efficiently in the harsh environment 
      created by green roofs in a dry climate. The root growth pattern showed that 
      retained water in the drainage layer is an alternative source of water for 
      plants. It was also shown that stormwater can be used as a source of irrigation 
      water for green roofs during six months of the year at the study site. In 
      summary, mild sloping intensive systems containing media type C and planted with 
      either Chrysocephalum apiculatum or Disphyma crassifolium showed the best 
      performance.

TI  - Addressing the unmet need for visualizing conditional random fields in biological 
      data.
PG  - 202
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-15-202 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The biological world is replete with phenomena that appear to be 
      ideally modeled and analyzed by one archetypal statistical framework - the 
      Graphical Probabilistic Model (GPM). The structure of GPMs is a uniquely good 
      match for biological problems that range from aligning sequences to modeling the 
      genome-to-phenome relationship. The fundamental questions that GPMs address 
      involve making decisions based on a complex web of interacting factors. 
      Unfortunately, while GPMs ideally fit many questions in biology, they are not an 
      easy solution to apply. Building a GPM is not a simple task for an end user. 
      Moreover, applying GPMs is also impeded by the insidious fact that the "complex 
      web of interacting factors" inherent to a problem might be easy to define and 
      also intractable to compute upon. DISCUSSION: We propose that the visualization 
      sciences can contribute to many domains of the bio-sciences, by developing tools 
      to address archetypal representation and user interaction issues in GPMs, and in 
      particular a variety of GPM called a Conditional Random Field(CRF). CRFs bring 
      additional power, and additional complexity, because the CRF dependency network 
      can be conditioned on the query data. CONCLUSIONS: In this manuscript we examine 
      the shared features of several biological problems that are amenable to modeling 
      with CRFs, highlight the challenges that existing visualization and visual 
      analytics paradigms induce for these data, and document an experimental solution 
      called StickWRLD which, while leaving room for improvement, has been successfully 
      applied in several biological research projects. Software and tutorials are 
      available at http://www.stickwrld.org/.

TI  - Genome-wide association for grain morphology in synthetic hexaploid wheats using 
      digital imaging analysis.
PG  - 128
LID - 10.1186/1471-2229-14-128 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Grain size and shape greatly influence grain weight which ultimately 
      enhances grain yield in wheat. Digital imaging (DI) based phenomic 
      characterization can capture the three dimensional variation in grain size and 
      shape than has hitherto been possible. In this study, we report the results from 
      using digital imaging of grain size and shape to understand the relationship 
      among different components of this trait, their contribution to enhance grain 
      weight, and to identify genomic regions (QTLs) controlling grain morphology using 
      genome wide association mapping with high density diversity array technology 
      (DArT) and allele-specific markers. RESULTS: Significant positive correlations 
      were observed between grain weight and grain size measurements such as grain 
      length (r = 0.43), width, thickness (r = 0.64) and factor from density (FFD) 
      (r = 0.69). A total of 231 synthetic hexaploid wheats (SHWs) were grouped into 
      five different sub-clusters by Bayesian structure analysis using unlinked DArT 
      markers. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay was observed among DArT loci > 10 cM 
      distance and approximately 28% marker pairs were in significant LD. In total, 197 
      loci over 60 chromosomal regions and 79 loci over 31 chromosomal regions were 
      associated with grain morphology by genome wide analysis using general linear 
      model (GLM) and mixed linear model (MLM) approaches, respectively. They were 
      mainly distributed on homoeologous group 2, 3, 6 and 7 chromosomes. Twenty eight 
      marker-trait associations (MTAs) on the D genome chromosomes 2D, 3D and 6D may 
      carry novel alleles with potential to enhance grain weight due to the use of 
      untapped wild accessions of Aegilops tauschii. Statistical simulations showed 
      that favorable alleles for thousand kernel weight (TKW), grain length, width and 
      thickness have additive genetic effects. Allelic variations for known genes 
      controlling grain size and weight, viz. TaCwi-2A, TaSus-2B, TaCKX6-3D and 
      TaGw2-6A, were also associated with TKW, grain width and thickness. In silico 
      functional analysis predicted a range of biological functions for 32 DArT loci 
      and receptor like kinase, known to affect plant development, appeared to be 
      common protein family encoded by several loci responsible for grain size and 
      shape. CONCLUSION: Conclusively, we demonstrated the application and integration 
      of multiple approaches including high throughput phenotyping using DI, genome 
      wide association studies (GWAS) and in silico functional analysis of candidate 
      loci to analyze target traits, and identify candidate genomic regions underlying 
      these traits. These approaches provided great opportunity to understand the 
      breeding value of SHWs for improving grain weight and enhanced our deep 
      understanding on molecular genetics of grain weight in wheat.

AB  - The present study compares protein diversity within three Anabaena species 
      (Anabaena doliolum, Anabaena sp.PCC 7120 and Anabaena L31). 2-DE based analysis 
      of 256 protein spots in control and 1, 3, 5, and 7days of salt treatment resulted 
      into 96 proteins arching across fourteen functional categories were assigned to 
      biochemical pathways using KOBAS 2.0. While 52.34% of the evaluated protein spots 
      were common across three species, the remaining 47.66% fraction mainly comprised 
      of the hypothetical and unknown proteins. PSORTb, CDD, Motifscan and Pfam 
      revealed function and subcellular localization for 27 of the 31 hypothetical and 
      unknown proteins. The differences in high salt tolerance (LC50) of A. doliolum 
      over A. L31 was reflected by (i) many fold accumulation (as spot volumes) of 
      Alr3090, Alr0803, peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase and modulator of DNA gyrase 
      proteins, and (ii) a better photosynthesis and energy homeostasis as indicated 
      through photosystem activity, respiration, ATP and NADPH contents. Some common 
      noteworthy salt effects include (i) photosystem damage, (ii) DNA damage repair, 
      (iii) upregulated protein synthesis, (iv) enhanced sulphur metabolism, and (v) 
      upregulated pentose phosphate pathway. 34 of the identified protein spots are 
      novel entries to the Anabaena salt proteome. This study reveals the existence of 
      separate strategies even within species to combat stress. BIOLOGICAL 
      SIGNIFICANCE: This study for the first time enumerates protein diversity in three 
      Anabaena species employing their presence/absence and relative abundance. 
      Proteomics integrated with physiology and bioinformatics deciphers differential 
      salt tolerance among the studied species and is the first of its kind to predict 
      the function of hypothetical and unknown proteins. Salt-induced proteomic 
      alterations clearly demonstrate significant metabolic shifts and existence of 
      separate molecular phenome among the species investigated. This may be 
      responsible for niche specificity limiting their application as biofertilizer. Of 
      the 96 identified proteins, a large chunk are new entries to the Anabaena salt 
      proteome while some protein genes may be used as potential candidates for 
      engineering salt tolerant cyanobacteria.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To harmonize standard operating procedures (SOPs) and standardize the 
      recording of associated data for collection, processing, and storage of fluid 
      biospecimens relevant to endometriosis. DESIGN: An international collaboration 
      involving 34 clinical/academic centers and 3 industry collaborators from 16 
      countries on 5 continents. SETTING: In 2013, 2 workshops were conducted, followed 
      by global consultation, bringing together 54 leaders in endometriosis research 
      and sample processing worldwide. PATIENT(S): None. INTERVENTION(S): Consensus 
      SOPs were based on: [1] systematic comparison of SOPs from 18 global centers 
      collecting fluid samples from women with and without endometriosis on a 
      medium/large scale (publication on >100 cases), [2] literature evidence where 
      available, or consultation with laboratory experts otherwise, and [3] several 
      global consultation rounds. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Standard recommended and 
      minimum required SOPs for biofluid collection, processing, and storage in 
      endometriosis research. RESULT(S): We developed recommended standard and minimum 
      required SOPs for the collection, processing, and storage of plasma, serum, 
      saliva, urine, endometrial/peritoneal fluid, and menstrual effluent, and a 
      biospecimen data-collection form necessary for interpretation of sample-derived 
      results. CONCLUSION(S): The Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking Harmonisation 
      Project SOPs allow endometriosis research centers to decrease variability in 
      biofluid sample results, facilitating between-center comparisons and 
      collaborations. The procedures are also relevant to research into other female 
      conditions involving biofluid samples subject to cyclic reproductive influences. 
      The consensus SOPs are based on the best available evidence; areas with limited 
      evidence are identified as requiring further pilot studies. The SOPs will be 
      reviewed based on investigator feedback, and through systematic tri-annual 
      follow-up. Updated versions will be made available at: 
      endometriosisfoundation.org/ephect.

TI  - The potential of transcription factor-based genetic engineering in improving crop 
      tolerance to drought.
PG  - 601-14

AB  - Drought is one of the major constraints in crop production and has an effect on a 
      global scale. In order to improve crop production, it is necessary to understand 
      how plants respond to stress. A good understanding of regulatory mechanisms 
      involved in plant responses during drought will enable researchers to explore and 
      manipulate key regulatory points in order to enhance stress tolerance in crops. 
      Transcription factors (TFs) have played an important role in crop improvement 
      from the dawn of agriculture. TFs are therefore good candidates for genetic 
      engineering to improve crop tolerance to drought because of their role as master 
      regulators of clusters of genes. Many families of TFs, such as CCAAT, 
      homeodomain, bHLH, NAC, AP2/ERF, bZIP, and WRKY have members that may have the 
      potential to be tools for improving crop tolerance to drought. In this review, 
      the roles of TFs as tools to improve drought tolerance in crops are discussed. 
      The review also focuses on current strategies in the use of TFs, with emphasis on 
      several major TF families in improving drought tolerance of major crops. Finally, 
      many promising transgenic lines that may have improved drought responses have 
      been poorly characterized and consequently their usefulness in the field is 
      uncertain. New advances in high-throughput phenotyping, both greenhouse and field 
      based, should facilitate improved phenomics of transgenic lines. Systems biology 
      approaches should then define the underlying changes that result in higher yields 
      under water stress conditions. These new technologies should help show whether 
      manipulating TFs can have effects on yield under field conditions.

AB  - Forward and reverse genetics now enable researchers to understand embryonic and 
      postnatal gene functioning in a wide range of species. Some genetic mutations 
      cause obvious morphological change, whereas other mutations can lead to more 
      subtle phenotypes and might be overlooked without adequate observations and 
      quantifications. Due to the increase in number of genetic model organisms 
      examined by the growing field of phenomics, standardized but sensitive methods 
      for quantitative analysis are increasingly necessary in the everyday practice of 
      analyzing ever-increasing quantities of phenotypic data. In this chapter, we have 
      presented platform-independent parameters for the use of microscopic X-ray 
      computed tomography (microCT) for phenotyping species-specific skeletal 
      morphology of a variety of different genetic model organisms.

AB  - In recent years the study of root phenotypic plasticity in response to 
      sub-optimal environmental factors and the genetic control of these responses have 
      received renewed attention. As a path to increased productivity, in particular 
      for low fertility soils, several applied research projects worldwide target the 
      improvement of crop root traits both in plant breeding and biotechnology 
      contexts. To assist these tasks and address the challenge of optimizing root 
      growth and architecture for enhanced mineral resource use, the development of 
      realistic simulation models is of great importance. We review this research field 
      from a modeling perspective focusing particularly on nutrient acquisition 
      strategies for crop production on low nitrogen and low phosphorous soils. Soil 
      heterogeneity and the dynamics of nutrient availability in the soil pose a 
      challenging environment in which plants have to forage efficiently for nutrients 
      in order to maintain their internal nutrient homeostasis throughout their life 
      cycle. Mathematical models assist in understanding plant growth strategies and 
      associated root phenes that have potential to be tested and introduced in 
      physiological breeding programs. At the same time, we stress that it is necessary 
      to carefully consider model assumptions and development from a whole 
      plant-resource allocation perspective and to introduce or refine modules 
      simulating explicitly root growth and architecture dynamics through ontogeny with 
      reference to key factors that constrain root growth. In this view it is important 
      to understand negative feedbacks such as plant-plant competition. We conclude by 
      briefly touching on available and developing technologies for quantitative root 
      phenotyping from lab to field, from quantification of partial root profiles in 
      the field to 3D reconstruction of whole root systems. Finally, we discuss how 
      these approaches can and should be tightly linked to modeling to explore the root 
      phenome.

TI  - Digital imaging approaches for phenotyping whole plant nitrogen and phosphorus 
      response in Brachypodium distachyon.
PG  - 781-96
LID - 10.1111/jipb.12198 [doi]
AB  - This work evaluates the phenotypic response of the model grass (Brachypodium 
      distachyon (L.) P. Beauv.) to nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition using a 
      combination of imaging techniques and destructive harvest of shoots and roots. 
      Reference line Bd21-3 was grown in pots using 11 phosphorus and 11 nitrogen 
      concentrations to establish a dose-response curve. Shoot biovolume and biomass, 
      root length and biomass, and tissue phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations 
      increased with nutrient concentration. Shoot biovolume, estimated by imaging, was 
      highly correlated with dry weight (R(2) > 0.92) and both biovolume and growth 
      rate responded strongly to nutrient availability. Higher nutrient supply 
      increased nodal root length more than other root types. Photochemical efficiency 
      was strongly reduced by low phosphorus concentrations as early as 1 week after 
      germination, suggesting that this measurement may be suitable for high throughput 
      screening of phosphorus response. In contrast, nitrogen concentration had little 
      effect on photochemical efficiency. Changes in biovolume over time were used to 
      compare growth rates of four accessions in response to nitrogen and phosphorus 
      supply. We demonstrate that a time series image-based approach coupled with 
      mathematical modeling provides higher resolution of genotypic response to 
      nutrient supply than traditional destructive techniques and shows promise for 
      high throughput screening and determination of genomic regions associated with 
      superior nutrient use efficiency.

TI  - Conventional and phenomics characterization provides insight into the diversity

AB  - Scarlet (Solanum aethiopicum) and gboma (S. macrocarpon) eggplants are major 
      vegetable crops in sub-Saharan Africa. Together with their respective wild 
      ancestors (S. anguivi and S. dasyphyllum) and intermediate cultivated-wild forms 
      they constitute the so-called scarlet and gboma eggplant complexes. We used 
      conventional descriptors and the high-throughput phenomics tool Tomato Analyzer 
      for characterizing 63 accessions of the scarlet eggplant complex, including the 
      four S. aethiopicum cultivar groups (Aculeatum, Gilo, Kumba, and Shum), 
      Intermediate S. aethiopicum-S. anguivi forms, and S. anguivi, and 12 cultivated 
      and wild accessions of the gboma eggplant complex. A large diversity was found 
      between both complexes, showing that they are very well differentiated from each 
      other. Within the scarlet eggplant complex, many significant differences were 
      also found among cultivar groups, but more differences were found for fruit 
      traits evaluated with Tomato Analyzer than with conventional descriptors. In 
      particular, Tomato Analyzer phenomics characterization was useful for 
      distinguishing small fruited groups (Shum, Intermediate, and S. anguivi), as well 
      as groups for which few or no significant differences were observed for plant 
      traits. Multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) separated well all 
      groups, except the Intermediate group which plotted between S. anguivi and small 
      fruited S. aethiopicum accessions. For the gboma eggplant complex, S. dasyphyllum 
      was clearly distinguished from S. macrocarpon and an important diversity was 
      found in the latter. The results have shown that both complexes are hypervariable 
      and have provided insight into their diversity and relationships. The information 
      obtained has important implications for the conservation and management of 
      genetic resources as well as for the selection and breeding of both scarlet and 
      gboma eggplants.

TI  - Plant stress biomarkers from biosimulations: the Transcriptome-To-Metabolome 
      (TTM) technology - effects of drought stress on rice.
PG  - 63-73
LID - 10.1111/plb.12221 [doi]
AB  - Measuring biomarkers from plant tissue samples is challenging and expensive when 
      the desire is to integrate transcriptomics, fluxomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, 
      proteomics, physiomics and phenomics. We present a computational biology method 
      where only the transcriptome needs to be measured and is used to derive a set of 
      parameters for deterministic kinetic models of metabolic pathways. The technology 
      is called Transcriptome-To-Metabolome (TTM) biosimulations, currently under 
      commercial development, but available for non-commercial use by researchers. The 
      simulated results on metabolites of 30 primary and secondary metabolic pathways 
      in rice (Oryza sativa) were used as the biomarkers to predict whether the 
      transcriptome was from a plant that had been under drought conditions. The rice 
      transcriptomes were accessed from public archives and each individual plant was 
      simulated. This unique quality of the TTM technology allows standard analyses on 
      biomarker assessments, i.e. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative 
      predictive values, accuracy, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve and 
      area under the ROC curve (AUC). Two validation methods were also used, the 
      holdout and 10-fold cross validations. Initially 17 metabolites were identified 
      as candidate biomarkers based on either statistical significance on binary 
      phenotype when compared with control samples or recognition from the literature. 
      The top three biomarkers based on AUC were gibberellic acid 12 (0.89), trehalose 
      (0.80) and sn1-palmitate-sn2-oleic-phosphatidylglycerol (0.70). Neither heat map 
      analyses of transcriptomes nor all 300 metabolites clustered the stressed and 
      control groups effectively. The TTM technology allows the emergent properties of 
      the integrated system to generate unique and useful 'Omics' information.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records (EHR) offer medical and pharmacogenomics 
      research unprecedented opportunities to identify and classify patients at risk. 
      EHRs are collections of highly inter-dependent records that include biological, 
      anatomical, physiological, and behavioral observations. They comprise a patient's 
      clinical phenome, where each patient has thousands of date-stamped records 
      distributed across many relational tables. Development of EHR computer-based 
      phenotyping algorithms require time and medical insight from clinical experts, 
      who most often can only review a small patient subset representative of the total 
      EHR records, to identify phenotype features. In this research we evaluate whether 
      relational machine learning (ML) using inductive logic programming (ILP) can 
      contribute to addressing these issues as a viable approach for EHR-based 
      phenotyping. METHODS: Two relational learning ILP approaches and three well-known 
      WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) implementations of 
      non-relational approaches (PART, J48, and JRIP) were used to develop models for 
      nine phenotypes. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) 
      coded EHR data were used to select training cohorts for the development of each 
      phenotypic model. Accuracy, precision, recall, F-Measure, and Area Under the 
      Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve statistics were measured for each 
      phenotypic model based on independent manually verified test cohorts. A two-sided 
      binomial distribution test (sign test) compared the five ML approaches across 
      phenotypes for statistical significance. RESULTS: We developed an approach to 
      automatically label training examples using ICD-9 diagnosis codes for the ML 
      approaches being evaluated. Nine phenotypic models for each ML approach were 
      evaluated, resulting in better overall model performance in AUROC using ILP when 
      compared to PART (p=0.039), J48 (p=0.003) and JRIP (p=0.003). DISCUSSION: ILP has 
      the potential to improve phenotyping by independently delivering clinically 
      expert interpretable rules for phenotype definitions, or intuitive phenotypes to 
      assist experts. CONCLUSION: Relational learning using ILP offers a viable 
      approach to EHR-driven phenotyping.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics (CNP) at UCLA was an 
      investigation into the biological bases of traits such as memory and response 
      inhibition phenotypes-to explore whether they are linked to syndromes including 
      ADHD, Bipolar disorder, and Schizophrenia. An aim of the consortium was in moving 
      from traditional categorical approaches for psychiatric syndromes towards more 
      quantitative approaches based on large-scale analysis of the space of human 
      variation. It represented an application of phenomics-wide-scale, systematic 
      study of phenotypes-to neuropsychiatry research. RESULTS: This paper reports on a 
      system for exploration of hypotheses in data obtained from the LA2K, LA3C, and 
      LA5C studies in CNP. ViVA is a system for exploratory data analysis using novel 
      mathematical models and methods for visualization of variance. An example of 
      these methods is called VISOVA, a combination of visualization and analysis of 
      variance, with the flavor of exploration associated with ANOVA in biomedical 
      hypothesis generation. It permits visual identification of phenotype 
      profiles-patterns of values across phenotypes-that characterize groups. 
      Visualization enables screening and refinement of hypotheses about variance 
      structure of sets of phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The ViVA system was designed for 
      exploration of neuropsychiatric hypotheses by interdisciplinary teams. Automated 
      visualization in ViVA supports 'natural selection' on a pool of hypotheses, and 
      permits deeper understanding of the statistical architecture of the data. 
      Large-scale perspective of this kind could lead to better neuropsychiatric 
      diagnostics.

AB  - We investigated systematic differences in corpus callosum morphology in 
      periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH). Differences in corpus callosum 
      mid-sagittal area and subregional area changes were measured using an automated 
      software-based method. Heterotopic gray matter deposits were automatically 
      labeled and compared with corpus callosum changes. The spatial pattern of corpus 
      callosum changes were interpreted in the context of the characteristic 
      anterior-posterior development of the corpus callosum in healthy individuals. 
      Individuals with periventricular nodular heterotopia were imaged at the Melbourne 
      Brain Center or as part of the multi-site Epilepsy Phenome Genome project. Whole 
      brain T1 weighted MRI was acquired in cases (n=48) and controls (n=663). The 
      corpus callosum was segmented on the mid-sagittal plane using the software 
      "yuki". Heterotopic gray matter and intracranial brain volume was measured using 
      Freesurfer. Differences in corpus callosum area and subregional areas were 
      assessed, as well as the relationship between corpus callosum area and 
      heterotopic GM volume. The anterior-posterior distribution of corpus callosum 
      changes and heterotopic GM nodules were quantified using a novel metric and 
      compared with each other. Corpus callosum area was reduced by 14% in PVNH 
      (p=1.59×10(-9)). The magnitude of the effect was least in the genu (7% reduction) 
      and greatest in the isthmus and splenium (26% reduction). Individuals with higher 
      heterotopic GM volume had a smaller corpus callosum. Heterotopic GM volume was 
      highest in posterior brain regions, however there was no linear relationship 
      between the anterior-posterior position of corpus callosum changes and PVNH 
      nodules. Reduced corpus callosum area is strongly associated with PVNH, and is 
      probably associated with abnormal brain development in this neurological 
      disorder. The primarily posterior corpus callosum changes may inform our 
      understanding of the etiology of PVNH. Our results suggest that interhemispheric 
      pathways are affected in PVNH.

AB  - Transcriptome studies have revealed a surprisingly high level of variation among 
      individuals in expression of key genes in the CNS under both normal and 
      experimental conditions. Ten-fold variation is common, yet the specific causes 
      and consequences of this variation are largely unknown. By combining classic gene 
      mapping methods-family linkage studies and genomewide association-with 
      high-throughput genomics, it is now possible to define quantitative trait loci 
      (QTLs), single-gene variants, and even single SNPs and indels that control gene 
      expression in different brain regions and cells. This review considers some of 
      the major technical and conceptual challenges in analyzing variation in 
      expression in the CNS with a focus on mRNAs, rather than noncoding RNAs or 
      proteins. At one level of analysis, this work has been highly successful, and we 
      finally have techniques that can be used to track down small numbers of loci that 
      control expression in the CNS. But at a higher level of analysis, we still do not 
      understand the genetic architecture of gene expression in brain, the consequences 
      of expression QTLs on protein levels or on cell function, or the combined impact 
      of expression differences on behavior and disease risk. These important gaps are 
      likely to be bridged over the next several decades using (1) much larger sample 
      sizes, (2) more powerful RNA sequencing and proteomic methods, and (3) novel 
      statistical and computational models to predict genome-to-phenome relations.

TI  - Functionally enigmatic genes: a case study of the brain ignorome.
PG  - e88889
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0088889 [doi]
LID - e88889
AB  - What proportion of genes with intense and selective expression in specific 
      tissues, cells, or systems are still almost completely uncharacterized with 
      respect to biological function? In what ways do these functionally enigmatic 
      genes differ from well-studied genes? To address these two questions, we devised 
      a computational approach that defines so-called ignoromes. As proof of principle, 
      we extracted and analyzed a large subset of genes with intense and selective 
      expression in brain. We find that publications associated with this set are 
      highly skewed--the top 5% of genes absorb 70% of the relevant literature. In 
      contrast, approximately 20% of genes have essentially no neuroscience literature. 
      Analysis of the ignorome over the past decade demonstrates that it is stubbornly 
      persistent, and the rapid expansion of the neuroscience literature has not had 
      the expected effect on numbers of these genes. Surprisingly, ignorome genes do 
      not differ from well-studied genes in terms of connectivity in coexpression 
      networks. Nor do they differ with respect to numbers of orthologs, paralogs, or 
      protein domains. The major distinguishing characteristic between these sets of 
      genes is date of discovery, early discovery being associated with greater 
      research momentum--a genomic bandwagon effect. Finally we ask to what extent 
      massive genomic, imaging, and phenotype data sets can be used to provide 
      high-throughput functional annotation for an entire ignorome. In a majority of 
      cases we have been able to extract and add significant information for these 
      neglected genes. In several cases--ELMOD1, TMEM88B, and DZANK1--we have exploited 
      sequence polymorphisms, large phenome data sets, and reverse genetic methods to 
      evaluate the function of ignorome genes.

TI  - Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) in EMR-linked pediatric cohorts, 
      genetically links PLCL1 to speech language development and IL5-IL13 to 
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis.
PG  - 401

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We report the first pediatric specific Phenome-Wide Association Study 
      (PheWAS) using electronic medical records (EMRs). Given the early success of 
      PheWAS in adult populations, we investigated the feasibility of this approach in 
      pediatric cohorts in which associations between a previously known genetic 
      variant and a wide range of clinical or physiological traits were evaluated. 
      Although computationally intensive, this approach has potential to reveal disease 
      mechanistic relationships between a variant and a network of phenotypes. METHOD: 
      Data on 5049 samples of European ancestry were obtained from the EMRs of two 
      large academic centers in five different genotyped cohorts. Recently, these 
      samples have undergone whole genome imputation. After standard quality controls, 
      removing missing data and outliers based on principal components analyses (PCA), 
      4268 samples were used for the PheWAS study. We scanned for associations between 
      2476 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with available genotyping data from 
      previously published GWAS studies and 539 EMR-derived phenotypes. The false 
      discovery rate was calculated and, for any new PheWAS findings, a permutation 
      approach (with up to 1,000,000 trials) was implemented. RESULTS: This PheWAS 
      found a variety of common variants (MAF > 10%) with prior GWAS associations in 
      our pediatric cohorts including Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA), Asthma, 
      Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) and Type 1 Diabetes with a 
      false discovery rate < 0.05 and power of study above 80%. In addition, several 
      new PheWAS findings were identified including a cluster of association near the 
      NDFIP1 gene for mental retardation (best SNP rs10057309, p = 4.33 × 10(-7), OR = 
      1.70, 95%CI = 1.38 - 2.09); association near PLCL1 gene for developmental delays 
      and speech disorder [best SNP rs1595825, p = 1.13 × 10(-8), OR = 0.65(0.57 - 
      0.76)]; a cluster of associations in the IL5-IL13 region with Eosinophilic 
      Esophagitis (EoE) [best at rs12653750, p = 3.03 × 10(-9), OR = 1.73 95%CI = (1.44 
      - 2.07)], previously implicated in asthma, allergy, and eosinophilia; and 
      association of variants in GCKR and JAZF1 with allergic rhinitis in our pediatric 
      cohorts [best SNP rs780093, p = 2.18 × 10(-5), OR = 1.39, 95%CI = (1.19 - 1.61)], 
      previously demonstrated in metabolic disease and diabetes in adults. CONCLUSION: 
      The PheWAS approach with re-mapping ICD-9 structured codes for our 
      European-origin pediatric cohorts, as with the previous adult studies, finds many 
      previously reported associations as well as presents the discovery of 
      associations with potentially important clinical implications.

AB  - To determine the breadth and underpinning of changes in immunocyte gene 
      expression due to genetic variation in mice, we performed, as part of the 
      Immunological Genome Project, gene expression profiling for CD4(+) T cells and 
      neutrophils purified from 39 inbred strains of the Mouse Phenome Database. 
      Considering both cell types, a large number of transcripts showed significant 
      variation across the inbred strains, with 22% of the transcriptome varying by 
      2-fold or more. These included 119 loci with apparent complete loss of function, 
      where the corresponding transcript was not expressed in some of the strains, 
      representing a useful resource of "natural knockouts." We identified 1222 
      cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) that control some of this 
      variation. Most (60%) cis-eQTLs were shared between T cells and neutrophils, but 
      a significant portion uniquely impacted one of the cell types, suggesting cell 
      type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Using a conditional regression algorithm, we 
      predicted regulatory interactions between transcription factors and potential 
      targets, and we demonstrated that these predictions overlap with regulatory 
      interactions inferred from transcriptional changes during immunocyte 
      differentiation. Finally, comparison of these and parallel data from CD4(+) T 
      cells of healthy humans demonstrated intriguing similarities in variability of a 
      gene's expression: the most variable genes tended to be the same in both species, 
      and there was an overlap in genes subject to strong cis-acting genetic variants. 
      We speculate that this "conservation of variation" reflects a differential 
      constraint on intraspecies variation in expression levels of different genes, 
      either through lower pressure for some genes, or by favoring variability for 
      others.

TI  - Improved drug therapy: triangulating phenomics with genomics and metabolomics.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/s40246-014-0016-9 [doi]
AB  - Embracing the complexity of biological systems has a greater likelihood to 
      improve prediction of clinical drug response. Here we discuss limitations of a 
      singular focus on genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, 
      metabolomics, or phenomics-highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each 
      individual technique. In contrast, 'systems biology' is proposed to allow 
      clinicians and scientists to extract benefits from each technique, while limiting 
      associated weaknesses by supplementing with other techniques when appropriate. 
      Perfect predictive modeling is not possible, whereas modeling of intertwined 
      phenomic responses using genomic stratification with metabolomic modifications 
      may greatly improve predictive values for drug therapy. We thus propose a 
      novel-integrated approach to personalized medicine that begins with phenomic 
      data, is stratified by genomics, and ultimately refined by metabolomic pathway 
      data. Whereas perfect prediction of efficacy and safety of drug therapy is not 
      possible, improvements can be achieved by embracing the complexity of the 
      biological system. Starting with phenomics, the combination of linking 
      metabolomics to identify common biologic pathways and then stratifying by genomic 
      architecture, might increase predictive values. This systems biology approach has 
      the potential, in specific subsets of patients, to avoid drug therapy that will 
      be either ineffective or unsafe.

TI  - Investigating the relationship between mitochondrial genetic variation and 
      cardiovascular-related traits to develop a framework for mitochondrial 
      phenome-wide association studies.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/1756-0381-7-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitochondria play a critical role in the cell and have DNA 
      independent of the nuclear genome. There is much evidence that mitochondrial DNA 
      (mtDNA) variation plays a role in human health and disease, however, this area of 
      investigation has lagged behind research into the role of nuclear genetic 
      variation on complex traits and phenotypic outcomes. Phenome-wide association 
      studies (PheWAS) investigate the association between a wide range of traits and 
      genetic variation. To date, this approach has not been used to investigate the 
      relationship between mtDNA variants and phenotypic variation. Herein, we describe 
      the development of a PheWAS framework for mtDNA variants (mt-PheWAS). Using the 
      Metabochip custom genotyping array, nuclear and mitochondrial DNA variants were 
      genotyped in 11,519 African Americans from the Vanderbilt University 
      biorepository, BioVU. We employed both polygenic modeling and association testing 
      with mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (mtSNPs) to explore the 
      relationship between mtDNA variants and a group of eight cardiovascular-related 
      traits obtained from de-identified electronic medical records within BioVU. 
      RESULTS: Using polygenic modeling we found evidence for an effect of mtDNA 
      variation on total cholesterol and type 2 diabetes (T2D). After performing 
      comprehensive mitochondrial single SNP associations, we identified an increased 
      number of single mtSNP associations with total cholesterol and T2D compared to 
      the other phenotypes examined, which did not have more significantly associated 
      SNPs than would be expected by chance. Among the mtSNPs significantly associated 
      with T2D we identified variant mt16189, an association previously reported only 
      in Asian and European-descent populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our replication of 
      previous findings and identification of novel associations from this initial 
      study suggest that our mt-PheWAS approach is robust for investigating the 
      relationship between mitochondrial genetic variation and a range of phenotypes, 
      providing a framework for future mt-PheWAS.

AB  - The environment's contribution to health has been conceptualized as the exposome. 
      Biomedical research interest in environmental exposures as a determinant of 
      physiopathological processes is rising as such data increasingly become 
      available. The panoply of miniaturized sensing devices now accessible and 
      affordable for individuals to use to monitor a widening range of parameters opens 
      up a new world of research data. Biomedical informatics (BMI) must provide a 
      coherent framework for dealing with multi-scale population data including the 
      phenome, the genome, the exposome, and their interconnections. The combination of 
      these more continuous, comprehensive, and personalized data sources requires new 
      research and development approaches to data management, analysis, and

AB  - The present study investigates individual differences in subjective sleepiness 
      profiles during 36 h of sustained wakefulness in a modified constant routine 
      protocol. Twenty-three volunteers (11 females), aged between 18 and 47 yrs (M age 
      = 30.41, SD = 10.26) enrolled in the study. Subjective sleepiness ratings were 
      collected every 2 h by means of visual analogue scales. Circadian rhythmicity was 
      assessed by means of salivary cortisol. Subjective sleepiness data were analyzed 
      using functional principal component analysis (fPCA). Our results show that 
      approximately 80% of the variance is accounted for by three functional 
      components. The first component explains 50.28% of the variance and is 
      characterized by a profile of exclusively positive loadings, representing 
      vertical shifts from the mean sleepiness profile. Scores on this component are 
      positively related to self-reported habitual sleep times and mean slow wave 
      activity (SWA) during wake. Positive scores on the second component (18.40% of 
      the variance) are characterized by a higher than average peak-to-trough amplitude 
      in subjective sleepiness profiles. Participants with higher than average scores 
      on this component show a significantly higher amplitude in salivary cortisol 
      profiles as opposed to participants with lower than average scores. Participants 
      with positive scores on the third component (10.09% of the variance) show higher 
      than average levels of subjective sleepiness during morning hours, a buildup of 
      wake effort occurring later and more afternoon sleepiness after sleep deprivation 
      than negative scorers. Peak levels of salivary cortisol occur significantly later 
      in these participants. Taken together, our results suggest that component 1 
      represents tonic differences in sleepiness profiles primarily related to 
      mechanisms of sleep homeostasis, component 2 to circadian amplitude differences 
      and component 3 to diurnal preference. However, since the components are 
      additions to a mean profile, each of the three components is likely to correspond 
      to a mixture of multiple physiological parameters, rather than to a single 
      process. The approach shows interesting potential for (1) revealing unidentified 
      physiological processes, (2) testing existing assumptions about regulatory 
      mechanisms at the basis of interindividual variability in sleepiness profiles and 
      (3) the specification of sleepiness phenotypes on a quantitative basis.

AB  - Cognition presents evolutionary research with one of its greatest challenges. 
      Cognitive evolution has been explained at the proximate level by shifts in 
      absolute and relative brain volume and at the ultimate level by differences in 
      social and dietary complexity. However, no study has integrated the experimental 
      and phylogenetic approach at the scale required to rigorously test these 
      explanations. Instead, previous research has largely relied on various measures 
      of brain size as proxies for cognitive abilities. We experimentally evaluated 
      these major evolutionary explanations by quantitatively comparing the cognitive 
      performance of 567 individuals representing 36 species on two problem-solving 
      tasks measuring self-control. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that absolute brain 
      volume best predicted performance across species and accounted for considerably 
      more variance than brain volume controlling for body mass. This result 
      corroborates recent advances in evolutionary neurobiology and illustrates the 
      cognitive consequences of cortical reorganization through increases in brain 
      volume. Within primates, dietary breadth but not social group size was a strong 
      predictor of species differences in self-control. Our results implicate robust 
      evolutionary relationships between dietary breadth, absolute brain volume, and 
      self-control. These findings provide a significant first step toward quantifying 
      the primate cognitive phenome and explaining the process of cognitive evolution.

AB  - MAGIC populations represent one of a new generation of crop genetic mapping 
      resources combining high genetic recombination and diversity. We describe the 
      creation and validation of an eight-parent MAGIC population consisting of 1091 F7 
      lines of winter-sown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Analyses based on genotypes 
      from a 90,000-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array find the population to 
      be well-suited as a platform for fine-mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) and 
      gene isolation. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) show the population to be 
      highly recombined; genetic marker diversity among the founders was 74% of that 
      captured in a larger set of 64 wheat varieties, and 54% of SNPs segregating among 
      the 64 lines also segregated among the eight founder lines. In contrast, a 
      commonly used reference bi-parental population had only 54% of the diversity of 
      the 64 varieties with 27% of SNPs segregating. We demonstrate the potential of 
      this MAGIC resource by identifying a highly diagnostic marker for the 
      morphological character "awn presence/absence" and independently validate it in 
      an association-mapping panel. These analyses show this large, diverse, and highly 
      recombined MAGIC population to be a powerful resource for the genetic dissection 
      of target traits in wheat, and it is well-placed to efficiently exploit ongoing 
      advances in phenomics and genomics. Genetic marker and trait data, together with 
      instructions for access to seed, are available at http://www.niab.com/MAGIC/.

AB  - Functional genetic analyses in mice rely on efficient and in-depth 
      characterization of the behavioral spectrum. Automated home-cage observation can 
      provide a systematic and efficient screening method to detect unexplored, novel 
      behavioral phenotypes. Here, we analyzed high-throughput automated home-cage data 
      using existing and novel concepts, to detect a plethora of genetic differences in 
      spontaneous behavior in a panel of commonly used inbred strains (129S1/SvImJ, 
      A/J, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, DBA/2J, NOD/LtJ, FVB/NJ, WSB/EiJ, PWK/PhJ and 
      CAST/EiJ). Continuous video-tracking observations of sheltering behavior and 
      locomotor activity were segmented into distinguishable behavioral elements, and 
      studied at different time scales, yielding a set of 115 behavioral parameters of 
      which 105 showed highly significant strain differences. This set of 115 
      parameters was highly dimensional; principal component analysis identified 26 
      orthogonal components with eigenvalues above one. Especially novel parameters of 
      sheltering behavior and parameters describing aspects of motion of the mouse in 
      the home-cage showed high genetic effect sizes. Multi-day habituation curves and 
      patterns of behavior surrounding dark/light phase transitions showed striking 
      strain differences, albeit with lower genetic effect sizes. This spontaneous 
      home-cage behavior study demonstrates high dimensionality, with a strong genetic 
      contribution to specific sets of behavioral measures. Importantly, spontaneous 
      home-cage behavior analysis detects genetic effects that cannot be studied in 
      conventional behavioral tests, showing that the inclusion of a few days of 
      undisturbed, labor extensive home-cage assessment may greatly aid gene function 
      analyses and drug target discovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A deficit in impulse control is a prominent, heritable symptom in 
      several psychiatric disorders, such as addiction, attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
      disorder, and schizophrenia. Here, we aimed to identify genes regulating 
      impulsivity, specifically of impulsive action, in mice. METHODS: Using the widely 
      used 5-choice serial reaction time task, we measured impulsive action in 1) a 
      panel of 41 BXD recombinant inbred strains of mice (n = 13.7 ± .8 per strain; n = 
      654 total) to detect underlying genetic loci; 2) congenic mice (n = 23) to 
      replicate the identified locus; 3) mice overexpressing the Nrg3 candidate gene in 
      the medial prefrontal cortex (n = 21); and 4) a Nrg3 loss-of-function mutant (n = 
      59) to functionally implicate the Nrg3 candidate gene in impulsivity. RESULTS: 
      Genetic mapping of impulsive action in the BXD panel identified a locus on 
      chromosome 14 (34.5-41.4 Mb), syntenic with the human 10q22-q23 
      schizophrenia-susceptibility locus. Congenic mice carrying the impulsivity locus 
      (Impu1) confirmed its influence on impulsive action. Increased impulsivity was 
      associated with increased Nrg3 gene expression in the medial prefrontal cortex 
      (mPFC). Viral overexpression of Nrg3 in the mPFC increased impulsivity, whereas a 
      constitutive Nrg3 loss-of-function mutation decreased it. CONCLUSIONS: The causal 
      relation between Nrg3 expression in the mPFC and level of impulsive action shown 
      here provides a mechanism by which polymorphism in NRG3 in humans contributes to 
      a specific cognitive deficit seen in several psychiatric diseases, such as 
      addiction, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia.

AB  - A collection of 368 advanced lines and cultivars of spring wheat (Triticum 
      aestivum L.) from Chile, Uruguay, and CIMMYT (Centro Internacional de 
      Mejoramiento de Maíz y Trigo), with good agronomic characteristics were evaluated 
      under the Mediterranean conditions of central Chile. Three different water 
      regimes were assayed: severe water stress (SWS, rain fed), mild water stress 
      (MWS; one irrigation around booting), and full irrigation (FI; four irrigations: 
      at tillering, flag leaf appearance, heading, and middle grain filling). Traits 
      evaluated were grain yield (GY), agronomical yield components, days from sowing 
      to heading, carbon isotope discrimination (Δ(13) C) in kernels, and canopy 
      spectral reflectance. Correlation analyses were performed for 70 spectral 
      reflectance indices (SRI) and the other traits evaluated in the three trials. GY 
      and Δ(13) C were the traits best correlated with SRI, particularly when these 
      indices were measured during grain filling. However, only GY could be predicted 
      using a single regression, with Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI2: 
      2,200; 1,100) having the best fit to the data for the three trials. For Δ(13) C, 
      only individual regressions could be forecast under FI (r(2): 0.25-0.37) and MWS 
      (r(2): 0.45-0.59) but not under SWS (r(2): 0.03-0.09). NIR-based SRI proved to be 
      better predictors than those that combine visible and NIR wavelengths.

AB  - Rice is the world's most important staple grown by millions of small-holder 
      farmers. Sustaining rice production relies on the intelligent use of rice 
      diversity. The 3,000 Rice Genomes Project is a giga-dataset of publically 
      available genome sequences (averaging 14× depth of coverage) derived from 3,000 
      accessions of rice with global representation of genetic and functional 
      diversity. The seed of these accessions is available from the International Rice 
      Genebank Collection. Together, they are an unprecedented resource for advancing 
      rice science and breeding technology. Our immediate challenge now is to 
      comprehensively and systematically mine this dataset to link genotypic variation 
      to functional variation with the ultimate goal of creating new and sustainable 
      rice varieties that can support a future world population that will approach 9.6 
      billion by 2050.

TI  - AISO: Annotation of Image Segments with Ontologies.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/2041-1480-5-50 [doi]
LID - 50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large quantities of digital images are now generated for biological 
      collections, including those developed in projects premised on the 
      high-throughput screening of genome-phenome experiments. These images often carry 
      annotations on taxonomy and observable features, such as anatomical structures 
      and phenotype variations often recorded in response to the environmental factors 
      under which the organisms were sampled. At present, most of these annotations are 
      described in free text, may involve limited use of non-standard vocabularies, and 
      rarely specify precise coordinates of features on the image plane such that a 
      computer vision algorithm could identify, extract and annotate them. Therefore, 
      researchers and curators need a tool that can identify and demarcate features in 
      an image plane and allow their annotation with semantically contextual ontology 
      terms. Such a tool would generate data useful for inter and intra-specific 
      comparison and encourage the integration of curation standards. In the future, 
      quality annotated image segments may provide training data sets for developing 
      machine learning applications for automated image annotation. RESULTS: We 
      developed a novel image segmentation and annotation software application, 
      "Annotation of Image Segments with Ontologies" (AISO). The tool enables 
      researchers and curators to delineate portions of an image into multiple 
      highlighted segments and annotate them with an ontology-based controlled 
      vocabulary. AISO is a freely available Java-based desktop application and runs on 
      multiple platforms. It can be downloaded at 
      http://www.plantontology.org/software/AISO. CONCLUSIONS: AISO enables curators 
      and researchers to annotate digital images with ontology terms in a manner which 
      ensures the future computational value of the annotated images. We foresee uses 
      for such data-encoded image annotations in biological data mining, machine 
      learning, predictive annotation, semantic inference, and comparative analyses.

AB  - The role that metabolic phenotyping can increasingly play in patient 
      stratification and personalised medicine is discussed. The background to the 
      general approach, comprehensive and simultaneous analysis of small-molecule 
      metabolites in biofluids, tissues and tissue extracts combined with suitable 
      multivariate statistical models, is summarised. The main techniques used (NMR and 
      mass spectrometry) are cited, and the implementation of dedicated phenome centres 
      is explained. Finally, the advantages and limitations, opportunities and 
      drawbacks of the approach are discussed.

TI  - Missing value imputation in high-dimensional phenomic data: imputable or not, and 
      how?
PG  - 346
LID - 10.1186/s12859-014-0346-6 [doi]
LID - 346
AB  - BACKGROUND: In modern biomedical research of complex diseases, a large number of 
      demographic and clinical variables, herein called phenomic data, are often 
      collected and missing values (MVs) are inevitable in the data collection process. 
      Since many downstream statistical and bioinformatics methods require complete 
      data matrix, imputation is a common and practical solution. In high-throughput 
      experiments such as microarray experiments, continuous intensities are measured 
      and many mature missing value imputation methods have been developed and widely 
      applied. Numerous methods for missing data imputation of microarray data have 
      been developed. Large phenomic data, however, contain continuous, nominal, binary 
      and ordinal data types, which void application of most methods. Though several 
      methods have been developed in the past few years, not a single complete 
      guideline is proposed with respect to phenomic missing data imputation. RESULTS: 
      In this paper, we investigated existing imputation methods for phenomic data, 
      proposed a self-training selection (STS) scheme to select the best imputation 
      method and provide a practical guideline for general applications. We introduced 
      a novel concept of "imputability measure" (IM) to identify missing values that 
      are fundamentally inadequate to impute. In addition, we also developed four 
      variations of K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) methods and compared with two existing 
      methods, multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) and missForest. The 
      four variations are imputation by variables (KNN-V), by subjects (KNN-S), their 
      weighted hybrid (KNN-H) and an adaptively weighted hybrid (KNN-A). We performed 
      simulations and applied different imputation methods and the STS scheme to three 
      lung disease phenomic datasets to evaluate the methods. An R package 
      "phenomeImpute" is made publicly available. CONCLUSIONS: Simulations and 
      applications to real datasets showed that MICE often did not perform well; KNN-A, 
      KNN-H and random forest were among the top performers although no method 
      universally performed the best. Imputation of missing values with low 
      imputability measures increased imputation errors greatly and could potentially 
      deteriorate downstream analyses. The STS scheme was accurate in selecting the 
      optimal method by evaluating methods in a second layer of missingness simulation. 
      All source files for the simulation and the real data analyses are available on 
      the author's publication website.

TI  - Remodeling of intermediate metabolism in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum 
      under nitrogen stress.
PG  - 412-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1419818112 [doi]
AB  - Diatoms are unicellular algae that accumulate significant amounts of 
      triacylglycerols as storage lipids when their growth is limited by nutrients. 
      Using biochemical, physiological, bioinformatics, and reverse genetic approaches, 
      we analyzed how the flux of carbon into lipids is influenced by nitrogen stress 
      in a model diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Our results reveal that the 
      accumulation of lipids is a consequence of remodeling of intermediate metabolism, 
      especially reactions in the tricarboxylic acid and the urea cycles. Specifically, 
      approximately one-half of the cellular proteins are cannibalized; whereas the 
      nitrogen is scavenged by the urea and glutamine synthetase/glutamine 
      2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase pathways and redirected to the de novo synthesis 
      of nitrogen assimilation machinery, simultaneously, the photobiological flux of 
      carbon and reductants is used to synthesize lipids. To further examine how 
      nitrogen stress triggers the remodeling process, we knocked down the gene 
      encoding for nitrate reductase, a key enzyme required for the assimilation of 
      nitrate. The strain exhibits 40-50% of the mRNA copy numbers, protein content, 
      and enzymatic activity of the wild type, concomitant with a 43% increase in 
      cellular lipid content. We suggest a negative feedback sensor that couples 
      photosynthetic carbon fixation to lipid biosynthesis and is regulated by the 
      nitrogen assimilation pathway. This metabolic feedback enables diatoms to rapidly 
      respond to fluctuations in environmental nitrogen availability.

AB  - Most genetic defects that arrest B-cell development in the bone marrow present 
      early in life with agammaglobulinemia, whereas incomplete antibody deficiency is 
      usually associated with circulating B cells. We report 3 related individuals with 
      a novel form of severe B-cell deficiency associated with partial persistence of 
      serum immunoglobulin arising from a missense mutation in NFKB2. Significantly, 
      this point mutation results in a D865G substitution and causes a failure of p100 
      phosphorylation that blocks processing to p52. Severe B-cell deficiency affects 
      mature and transitional cells, mimicking the action of rituximab. This phenotype 
      appears to be due to disruption of canonical and noncanonical nuclear factor κB 
      pathways by the mutant p100 molecule. These findings could be informative for 
      therapeutics as well as immunodeficiency.

AB  - The shapes of plant leaves are important features to biologists, as they can help 
      in distinguishing plant species, measuring their health, analyzing their growth 
      patterns, and understanding relations between various species. Most of the 
      methods that have been developed in the past focus on comparing the shape of 
      individual leaves using either descriptors or finite sets of landmarks. However, 
      descriptor-based representations are not invertible and thus it is often hard to 
      map descriptor variability into shape variability. On the other hand, 
      landmark-based techniques require automatic detection and registration of the 
      landmarks, which is very challenging in the case of plant leaves that exhibit 
      high variability within and across species. In this paper, we propose a 
      statistical model based on the Squared Root Velocity Function (SRVF) 
      representation and the Riemannian elastic metric of Srivastava et al. (2011) to 
      model the observed continuous variability in the shape of plant leaves. We treat 
      plant species as random variables on a non-linear shape manifold and thus 
      statistical summaries, such as means and covariances, can be computed. One can 
      then study the principal modes of variations and characterize the observed shapes 
      using probability density models, such as Gaussians or Mixture of Gaussians. We 
      demonstrate the usage of such statistical model for (1) efficient classification 
      of individual leaves, (2) the exploration of the space of plant leaf shapes, 
      which is important in the study of population-specific variations, and (3) 
      comparing entire plant species, which is fundamental to the study of evolutionary 
      relationships in plants. Our approach does not require descriptors or landmarks 
      but automatically solves for the optimal registration that aligns a pair of 
      shapes. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on publicly 
      available benchmarks such as the Flavia, the Swedish, and the ImageCLEF2011 plant 
      leaf datasets.

AB  - Understanding of the avian male gamete biology is essential to improve the 
      conservation of genetic resources and performance in farming. In this study, the 
      chicken semen peptidome/proteome and the molecular phenotype related to sperm 
      quality were investigated. Spermatozoa (SPZ) and corresponding seminal plasma 
      (SP) from 11 males with different fertilizing capacity were analyzed using three 
      quantitative strategies (fluid and intact cells MALDI-MS, SDS-PAGE combined to 
      LC-MS/MS with spectral counting and XIC methods). Individual MALDI profiling in 
      combination with top-down MS allowed to characterize specific profiles per male 
      and to identify 16 biomolecules (e.g.VMO1, AvBD10 and AvBD9 including 
      polymorphism). Qualitative analysis identified 1165 proteins mainly involved in 
      oxidoreduction mechanisms, energy processes, proteolysis and protein 
      localization. Comparative analyses between the most and the least fertile males 
      were performed. The enzymes involved in energy metabolism, respiratory chain or 
      oxido-reduction activity were over-represented in SPZ of the most fertile males. 
      The SP of the most and the least fertile males differed also on many proteins 
      (e.g. ACE, AvBD10 and AvBD9, NEL precursor, acrosin). Thus proteomic is a 
      "phenomic molecular tool" that may help to discriminate avian males on their 
      reproductive capacity. The data have been deposited with ProteomeXchange 
      (identifiers PXD000287 and PXD001254). BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This peptidomic 
      and proteomic study i) characterized for the first time the semen protein 
      composition of the main domestic avian species (Gallus gallus) by analysis of 
      ejaculated spermatozoa and corresponding seminal plasma; ii) established a 
      characteristic molecular phenotype distinguishing semen and males at an 
      individual level; and iii) proposedthe first evidence of biomarkers related to 
      fertility.

AB  - Several computational methods have been developed that integrate transcriptomic 
      data with genome-scale metabolic reconstructions to infer condition-specific 
      system-wide intracellular metabolic flux distributions. In this mini-review, we 
      describe each of these methods published to date with categorizing them based on 
      four different grouping criteria (requirement for multiple gene expression 
      datasets as input, requirement for a threshold to define a gene's high and low 
      expression, requirement for a priori assumption of an appropriate objective 
      function, and validation of predicted fluxes directly against measured 
      intracellular fluxes). Then, we recommend which group of methods would be more 
      suitable from a practical perspective.

TI  - MOST: a software environment for constraint-based metabolic modeling and strain 
      design.
PG  - 610-1
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu685 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: MOST (metabolic optimization and simulation tool) is a software package 
      that implements GDBB (genetic design through branch and bound) in an intuitive 
      user-friendly interface with excel-like editing functionality, as well as 
      implementing FBA (flux balance analysis), and supporting systems biology markup 
      language and comma-separated values files. GDBB is currently the fastest 
      algorithm for finding gene knockouts predicted by FBA to increase production of 
      desired products, but GDBB has only been available on a command line interface, 
      which is difficult to use for those without programming knowledge, until the 
      release of MOST. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MOST is distributed for free on 
      the GNU General Public License. The software and full documentation are available 
      at http://most.ccib.rutgers.edu/. CONTACT: dslun@rutgers.edu.

TI  - Constraint-based modeling of heterologous pathways: application and experimental 
      demonstration for overproduction of fatty acids in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 2056-66
LID - 10.1002/bit.25261 [doi]
AB  - Constraint-based modeling has been shown, in many instances, to be useful for 
      metabolic engineering by allowing the prediction of the metabolic phenotype 
      resulting from genetic manipulations. But the basic premise of constraint-based 
      modeling-that of applying constraints to preclude certain behaviors-only makes 
      sense for certain genetic manipulations (such as knockouts and knockdowns). In 
      particular, when genes (such as those associated with a heterologous pathway) are 
      introduced under artificial control, it is unclear how to predict the correct 
      behavior. In this paper, we introduce a modeling method that we call proportional 
      flux forcing (PFF) to model artificially induced enzymatic genes. The model 
      modifications introduced by PFF can be transformed into a set of simple mass 
      balance constraints, which allows computational methods for strain optimization 
      based on flux balance analysis (FBA) to be utilized. We applied PFF to the 
      metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli (E. coli) for free fatty acid (FFA) 
      production-a metabolic engineering problem that has attracted significant 
      attention because FFAs are a precursor to liquid transportation fuels such as 
      biodiesel and biogasoline. We show that PFF used in conjunction with FBA-based 
      computational strain optimization methods can yield non-obvious genetic 
      manipulation strategies that significantly increase FFA production in E. coli. 
      The two mutant strains constructed and successfully tested in this work had peak 
      fatty acid (FA) yields of 0.050 g FA/g carbon source (17.4% theoretical yield) 
      and 0.035 g FA/g carbon source (12.3% theoretical yield) when they were grown 
      using a mixed carbon source of glucose and casamino acids in a ratio of 2-to-1. 
      These yields represent increases of 5.4- and 3.8-fold, respectively, over the 
      baseline strain.

AB  - The tomato is an ideal plant species for genomic and evolutionary studies. Thanks 
      to recent technical advances, a plethora of information relating to tomato 
      genomics has been generated. In addition, various phenotypes related to 
      morphology, physiology and yield have been investigated in tomato and its wild 
      relatives. In this review, we summarize recent key findings in tomato genomics 
      that used both developmental and evolutionary approaches to link the genome to 
      phenome. Combined, these perspectives allow us to look at the trends in tomato 
      evolution in addition to providing insight into the future direction of research 
      that can utilize this unique model species.

AB  - Seed metabolites are critically important both for plant development and human 
      nutrition; however, the natural variation in their levels remains poorly 
      characterized. Here we profiled 121 metabolites in mature seeds of a wide panel 
      Oryza sativa japonica and indica cultivars, revealing correlations between the 
      metabolic phenotype and geographic origin of the rice seeds. Moreover, japonica 
      and indica subspecies differed significantly not only in the relative abundances 
      of metabolites but also in their corresponding metabolic association networks. 
      These findings provide important insights into metabolic adaptation in rice 
      subgroups, bridging the gap between genome and phenome, and facilitating the 
      identification of genetic control of metabolic properties that can serve as a 
      basis for the future improvement of rice quality via metabolic engineering.

TI  - The teeth and faces of twins: providing insights into dentofacial development and 
      oral health for practising oral health professionals.
PG  - 101-16
LID - 10.1111/adj.12101 [doi]
AB  - The continuing studies of the teeth and faces of Australian twins and their 
      families in the Craniofacial Biology Research Group in the School of Dentistry at 
      the University of Adelaide began 30 years ago. Three main cohorts of twins have 
      been recruited, enabling various objectives and specific hypotheses to be 
      addressed about the roles of genetic, epigenetic and environmental influences on 
      human dentofacial growth and development, as well as oral health. This paper 
      highlights some key findings arising from these studies, emphasizing those of 
      direct relevance to practising oral health professionals. We also draw on 
      published literature to review the significant developments in relation to the 
      use of precision 2D and 3D imaging equipment, the application of modern molecular 
      techniques, and the development of sophisticated computer software for analysing 
      genetic relationships and comparing complex shapes. Such developments are 
      valuable for current and future work. Apart from the classical or traditional 
      twin model, there are several other twin models that can be used in research to 
      clarify the relative contributions of genetic, epigenetic and environmental 
      contributions to phenotypic variation. The monozygotic (MZ) co-twin model is one 
      particularly valuable method, given that examination of only one pair of MZ twins 
      can provide considerable insights into underlying causes of observed variation. 
      This model can be used in a dental practice environment, with oral health 
      professionals having the opportunity to explore differences in orofacial 
      structures between MZ co-twins who are attending as patients. As researchers have 
      become more aware of the complexities of the interactions between the genome, the 
      epigenome and the environment during development, there is the need to collect 
      more phenotypic data and define new phenotypes that will better characterize 
      variations in growth processes and health status. When coupled with powerful new 
      genetic approaches, including genome-wide association studies and linkage 
      analyses, exciting opportunities are opening up to unravel the causes of problems 
      in craniofacial growth and common oral diseases in human populations.

TI  - Cellular responses during morphological transformation in Azospirillum brasilense

LID - e114435
AB  - FlcA is a response regulator controlling flocculation and the morphological 
      transformation of Azospirillum cells from vegetative to cyst-like forms. To 
      understand the cellular responses of Azospirillum to conditions that cause 
      morphological transformation, proteins differentially expressed under 
      flocculation conditions in A. brasilense Sp7 and its flcA knockout mutant were 
      investigated. Comparison of 2-DE protein profiles of wild-type (Sp7) and a flcA 
      deletion mutant (Sp7-flcAΔ) revealed a total of 33 differentially expressed 2-DE 
      gel spots, with 22 of these spots confidently separated to allow protein 
      identification. Analysis of these spots by liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and MASCOT database searching identified 48 proteins 
      (≥10% emPAI in each spot). The functional characteristics of these proteins 
      included carbon metabolism (beta-ketothiolase and citrate synthase), nitrogen 
      metabolism (Glutamine synthetase and nitric oxide synthase), stress tolerance 
      (superoxide dismutase, Alkyl hydroperoxidase and ATP-dependent Clp protease 
      proteolytic subunit) and morphological transformation (transducer coupling 
      protein). The observed differences between Sp7 wild-type and flcA- strains 
      enhance our understanding of the morphological transformation process and help to 
      explain previous phenotypical observations. This work is a step forward in 
      connecting the Azospirillum phenome and genome.

TI  - Kinesins have a dual function in organizing microtubules during both tip growth 
      and cytokinesis in Physcomitrella patens.
PG  - 1256-66
LID - 10.1105/tpc.113.121723 [doi]
AB  - Microtubules (MTs) play a crucial role in the anisotropic deposition of cell wall 
      material, thereby affecting the direction of growth. A wide range of tip-growing 
      cells display highly polarized cell growth, and MTs have been implicated in 
      regulating directionality and expansion. However, the molecular machinery 
      underlying MT dynamics in tip-growing plant cells remains unclear. Here, we show 
      that highly dynamic MT bundles form cyclically in the polarized expansion zone of 
      the moss Physcomitrella patens caulonemal cells through the coalescence of 
      growing MT plus ends. Furthermore, the plant-specific kinesins (KINID1) that are 
      is essential for the proper MT organization at cytokinesis also regulate the 
      turnover of the tip MT bundles as well as the directionality and rate of cell 
      growth. The plus ends of MTs grow toward the expansion zone, and KINID1 is 
      necessary for the stability of a single coherent focus of MTs in the center of 
      the zone, whose formation coincides with the accumulation of KINID1. We propose 
      that KINID-dependent MT bundling is essential for the correct directionality of 
      growth as well as for promoting growth per se. Our findings indicate that two 
      localized cell wall deposition processes, tip growth and cytokinesis, previously 
      believed to be functionally and evolutionarily distinct, share common and 
      plant-specific MT regulatory components.

AB  - Over the last decade, significant technological breakthroughs have revolutionized 
      human genomic research in the form of genome-wide association studies (GWASs). 
      GWASs have identified thousands of statistically significant genetic variants 
      associated with hundreds of human conditions including many with immunological 
      aetiologies (e.g. multiple sclerosis, ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid 
      arthritis). Unfortunately, most GWASs fail to identify clinically significant 
      associations. Identifying biologically significant variants by GWAS also presents 
      a challenge. The GWAS is a phenotype-to-genotype approach. As a 
      complementary/alternative approach to the GWAS, investigators have begun to 
      exploit extensive electronic medical record systems to conduct a 
      genotype-to-phenotype approach when studying human disease - specifically, the 
      phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). Although the PheWAS approach is in its 
      infancy, this method has already demonstrated its capacity to rediscover 
      important genetic associations related to immunological diseases/conditions. 
      Furthermore, PheWAS has the advantage of identifying genetic variants with 
      pleiotropic properties. This is particularly relevant for HLA variants. For 
      example, PheWAS results have demonstrated that the HLA-DRB1 variant associated 
      with multiple sclerosis may also be associated with erythematous conditions 
      including rosacea. Likewise, PheWAS has demonstrated that the HLA-B genotype is 
      not only associated with spondylopathies, uveitis, and variability in platelet 
      count, but may also play an important role in other conditions, such as 
      mastoiditis. This review will discuss and compare general PheWAS methodologies, 
      describe both the challenges and advantages of the PheWAS, and provide insight 
      into the potential directions in which PheWAS may lead.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electronic medical records (EMRs) data is increasingly incorporated 
      into genome-phenome association studies. Investigators hope to share data, but 
      there are concerns it may be "re-identified" through the exploitation of various 
      features, such as combinations of standardized clinical codes. Formal 
      anonymization algorithms (e.g., k-anonymization) can prevent such violations, but 
      prior studies suggest that the size of the population available for anonymization 
      may influence the utility of the resulting data. We systematically investigate 
      this issue using a large-scale biorepository and EMR system through which we 
      evaluate the ability of researchers to learn from anonymized data for 
      genome-phenome association studies under various conditions. METHODS: We use a 
      k-anonymization strategy to simulate a data protection process (on data sets 
      containing clinical codes) for resources of similar size to those found at nine 
      academic medical institutions within the United States. Following the protection 
      process, we replicate an existing genome-phenome association study and compare 
      the discoveries using the protected data and the original data through the 
      correlation (r(2)) of the p-values of association significance. RESULTS: Our 
      investigation shows that anonymizing an entire dataset with respect to the 
      population from which it is derived yields significantly more utility than small 
      study-specific datasets anonymized unto themselves. When evaluated using the 
      correlation of genome-phenome association strengths on anonymized data versus 
      original data, all nine simulated sites, results from largest-scale 
      anonymizations (population ∼100,000) retained better utility to those on smaller 
      sizes (population ∼6000-75,000). We observed a general trend of increasing r(2) 
      for larger data set sizes: r(2)=0.9481 for small-sized datasets, r(2)=0.9493 for 
      moderately-sized datasets, r(2)=0.9934 for large-sized datasets. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This research implies that regardless of the overall size of an institution's 
      data, there may be significant benefits to anonymization of the entire EMR, even 
      if the institution is planning on releasing only data about a specific cohort of 
      patients.

TI  - Molecular and physiological responses to abiotic stress in forest trees and their 
      relevance to tree improvement.
PG  - 1181-98
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpu012 [doi]
AB  - Abiotic stresses, such as drought, salinity and cold, are the major environmental 
      stresses that adversely affect tree growth and, thus, forest productivity, and 
      play a major role in determining the geographic distribution of tree species. 
      Tree responses and tolerance to abiotic stress are complex biological processes 
      that are best analyzed at a systems level using genetic, genomic, metabolomic and 
      phenomic approaches. This will expedite the dissection of stress-sensing and 
      signaling networks to further support efficient genetic improvement programs. 
      Enormous genetic diversity for stress tolerance exists within some forest-tree 
      species, and due to advances in sequencing technologies the molecular genetic 
      basis for this diversity has been rapidly unfolding in recent years. In addition, 
      the use of emerging phenotyping technologies extends the suite of traits that can 
      be measured and will provide us with a better understanding of stress tolerance. 
      The elucidation of abiotic stress-tolerance mechanisms will allow for effective 
      pyramiding of multiple tolerances in a single tree through genetic engineering. 
      Here we review recent progress in the dissection of the molecular basis of 
      abiotic stress tolerance in forest trees, with special emphasis on Populus, 
      Pinus, Picea, Eucalyptus and Quercus spp. We also outline practices that will 
      enable the deployment of trees engineered for abiotic stress tolerance to land 
      owners. Finally, recommendations for future work are discussed.

LID - 10.7554/eLife.03549 [doi]
LID - e03549
AB  - The generation of naïve T lymphocytes is critical for immune function yet the 
      mechanisms governing their maturation remain incompletely understood. We have 
      identified a mouse mutant, bloto, that harbors a hypomorphic mutation in the zinc 
      finger protein Zfp335. Zfp335(bloto/bloto) mice exhibit a naïve T cell deficiency 
      due to an intrinsic developmental defect that begins to manifest in the thymus 
      and continues into the periphery, affecting T cells that have recently undergone 
      thymic egress. The effects of Zfp335(bloto) are multigenic and cannot be 
      attributed to altered thymic selection, proliferation or Bcl2-dependent survival. 
      Zfp335 binds to promoter regions via a consensus motif, and its target genes are 
      enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and 
      transcriptional regulation. Restoring the expression of one target, Ankle2, 
      partially rescues T cell maturation. These findings identify Zfp335 as a 
      transcription factor and essential regulator of late-stage intrathymic and 
      post-thymic T cell maturation.

TI  - Detection of pleiotropy through a Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of

AB  - We performed a Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) utilizing diverse 
      genotypic and phenotypic data existing across multiple populations in the 
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), conducted by the 
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and accessed by the 
      Epidemiological Architecture for Genes Linked to Environment (EAGLE) study. We 
      calculated comprehensive tests of association in Genetic NHANES using 80 SNPs and 
      1,008 phenotypes (grouped into 184 phenotype classes), stratified by 
      race-ethnicity. Genetic NHANES includes three surveys (NHANES III, 1999-2000, and 
      2001-2002) and three race-ethnicities: non-Hispanic whites (n = 6,634), 
      non-Hispanic blacks (n = 3,458), and Mexican Americans (n = 3,950). We identified 
      69 PheWAS associations replicating across surveys for the same SNP, 
      phenotype-class, direction of effect, and race-ethnicity at p<0.01, allele 
      frequency >0.01, and sample size >200. Of these 69 PheWAS associations, 39 
      replicated previously reported SNP-phenotype associations, 9 were related to 
      previously reported associations, and 21 were novel associations. Fourteen 
      results had the same direction of effect across more than one race-ethnicity: one 
      result was novel, 11 replicated previously reported associations, and two were 
      related to previously reported results. Thirteen SNPs showed evidence of 
      pleiotropy. We further explored results with gene-based biological networks, 
      contrasting the direction of effect for pleiotropic associations across 
      phenotypes. One PheWAS result was ABCG2 missense SNP rs2231142, associated with 
      uric acid levels in both non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans, 
      protoporphyrin levels in non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans, and blood 
      pressure levels in Mexican Americans. Another example was SNP rs1800588 near 
      LIPC, significantly associated with the novel phenotypes of folate levels 
      (Mexican Americans), vitamin E levels (non-Hispanic whites) and triglyceride 
      levels (non-Hispanic whites), and replication for cholesterol levels. The results 
      of this PheWAS show the utility of this approach for exposing more of the complex 
      genetic architecture underlying multiple traits, through generating novel 
      hypotheses for future research.

AB  - Schistosomiasis, one of the most important neglected tropical diseases worldwide, 
      is caused by flatworms (blood flukes or schistosomes) that live in the 
      bloodstream of humans. The hepatointestinal form of this debilitating disease 
      results from a chronic infection with Schistosoma mansoni or Schistosoma 
      japonicum. No vaccine is available to prevent schistosomiasis, and treatment 
      relies predominantly on the use of a single drug, praziquantel. In spite of 
      considerable research effort over the years, very little is known about the 
      complex in vivo events that lead to granuloma formation and other pathological 
      changes during infection. Here we use, for the first time, a lentivirus-based 
      transduction system to deliver microRNA-adapted short hairpin RNAs (shRNAmirs) 
      into the parasite to silence and explore selected protein-encoding genes of S. 
      mansoni implicated in the disease process. This gene-silencing system has 
      potential to be used for functional genomic-phenomic studies of a range of 
      socioeconomically important pathogens.

TI  - Haptoglobin duplicon, hemoglobin, and vitamin C: analyses in the british women's 
      heart and health study and Caerphilly prospective study.
PG  - 529456
LID - 10.1155/2014/529456 [doi]
LID - 529456
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haptoglobin acts as an antioxidant by limiting peroxidative tissue 
      damage by free hemoglobin. The haptoglobin gene allele Hp2 comprises a 1.7 kb 
      partial duplication. Relative to allele Hp1, Hp2 carriers form protein multimers, 
      suboptimal for hemoglobin scavenging. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of 
      haptoglobin genotype with a range of phenotypes, with emphasis on vitamin C and 
      hemoglobin levels. METHODS: We applied a quantitative PCR assay for the 
      duplication junction to two population cohorts including 2747 British women and 
      1198 British men. We examined the association of haptoglobin duplicon copy number 
      with hemoglobin and vitamin C and used the copy number to complete a phenome 
      scan. RESULTS: Hemoglobin concentrations were greater in those with Hp2,2 
      genotype, in women only (Hp1,1 13.45 g/dL, Hp1,2 13.49 g/dL, Hp2,2 13.61 g/dL; P 
      = 0.002), though statistically there was no evidence of a difference between the 
      sexes (z value = 1.2, P = 0.24). Haptoglobin genotype was not associated with 
      vitamin C or any other phenotype in either cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do 
      not support association of haptoglobin genotype with vitamin C or with other 
      phenotypes measured in two population cohorts. The apparent association between 
      haptoglobin genotype and hemoglobin in the women's cohort merits further 
      investigation.

AB  - The Mouse Phenome Database (MPD; phenome.jax.org) was launched in 2001 as the 
      data coordination center for the international Mouse Phenome Project. MPD 
      integrates quantitative phenotype, gene expression and genotype data into a 
      common annotated framework to facilitate query and analysis. MPD contains >3500 
      phenotype measurements or traits relevant to human health, including cancer, 
      aging, cardiovascular disorders, obesity, infectious disease susceptibility, 
      blood disorders, neurosensory disorders, drug addiction and toxicity. Since our 
      2012 NAR report, we have added >70 new data sets, including data from 
      Collaborative Cross lines and Diversity Outbred mice. During this time we have 
      completely revamped our homepage, improved search and navigational aspects of the 
      MPD application, developed several web-enabled data analysis and visualization 
      tools, annotated phenotype data to public ontologies, developed an ontology 
      browser and released new single nucleotide polymorphism query functionality with 
      much higher density coverage than before. Here, we summarize recent data 
      acquisitions and describe our latest improvements.

AB  - Genetic improvement programs around the world rely on the collection of accurate 
      phenotypic data. These phenotypes have an inherent value that can be estimated as 
      the contribution of an additional record to genetic gain. Here, the contribution 
      of phenotypes to genetic gain was calculated using traditional progeny testing 
      (PT) and 2 genomic selection (GS) strategies that, for simplicity, included 
      either males or females in the reference population. A procedure to estimate the 
      theoretical economic contribution of a phenotype to a breeding program is 
      described for both GS and PT breeding programs through the increment in genetic 
      gain per unit of increase in estimated breeding value reliability obtained when 
      an additional phenotypic record is added. The main factors affecting the value of 
      a phenotype were the economic value of the trait, the number of phenotypic 
      records already available for the trait, and its heritability. Furthermore, the 
      value of a phenotype was affected by several other factors, including the cost of 
      establishing the breeding program and the cost of phenotyping and genotyping. The 
      cost of achieving a reliability of 0.60 was assessed for different reference 
      populations for GS. Genomic reference populations of more sires with small 
      progeny group sizes (e.g., 20 equivalent daughters) had a lower cost than those 
      reference populations with either large progeny group sizes for fewer genotyped 
      sires, or female reference populations, unless the heritability was large and the 
      cost of phenotyping exceeded a few hundred dollars; then, female reference 
      populations were preferable from an economic perspective.

TI  - Genetic diversity among mandarins in fruit-quality traits.
PG  - 4938-46
LID - 10.1021/jf5002414 [doi]
AB  - A detailed phenotypic analysis of fruit-quality traits was conducted among 46 
      mandarin varieties within the Israeli Citrus breeding collection, belonging to 
      genetically different natural subgroups, including common mandarin (C. reticulata 
      Blanco), clementine (C. clementina Hort. ex. Tan), satsuma (C. unshiu 
      Marcovitch), Mediterranean mandarin (C. deliciosa Tenore), King mandarin (C. 
      nobilis Loureiro), and mandarin hybrids, such as tangor (C. reticulata × C. 
      sinensis) and tangelo (C. reticulata × C. paradisi). Evaluated qualities included 
      physical attributes (size, shape, color, peel thickness, and seed number); 
      physiological properties (ripening period, peelability, and segmentation); 
      nutritional and biochemical composition (vitamin C, phenol, flavonoid, and 
      carotenoid contents and total antioxidant activity); and sensory attributes 
      (total soluble solids and acid levels, flavor preference, sweetness, sourness, 
      and fruitiness). The results indicated wide genetic variability in fruit-quality 
      traits among mandarin varieties and natural subgroups, and statistical and 
      hierarchical clustering analysis revealed multiple correlations among attributes. 
      Such phenomic analysis is an obligatory requirement for identification of 
      molecular markers for distinct fruit-quality traits and for selection of 
      appropriate parents for future breeding programs.

AB  - Fish represent the most diverse class of vertebrates on Earth and also an 
      unprecedented, but as of yet still largely untapped, resource for comparative 
      analyses that can illuminate answers to questions about both how organisms work 
      and how they evolved. The current review is a general discussion of some of the 
      basic principles of why adding new species such as fish to the short list of 
      biomedical model organisms (mainly the house mouse and the rat) has merit. In 
      addition to the general points, it also reviews some questions about a newcomer, 
      the zebrafish, which is rapidly gaining popularity in brain and behavior 
      research. It discusses some examples demonstrating the advantages and 
      disadvantages of the zebrafish mainly in the context of biomedical research. It 
      is followed by other articles that further elaborate on these questions.

TI  - Chlorophyll, anthocyanin, and gas exchange changes assessed by spectroradiometry 
      in Fragaria chiloensis under salt stress.
PG  - 505-15
LID - 10.1111/jipb.12193 [doi]
AB  - Chlorophyll and anthocyanin contents provide a valuable indicator of the status 
      of a plant's physiology, but to be more widely utilized it needs to be assessed 
      easily and non-destructively. This is particularly evident in terms of assessing 
      and exploiting germplasm for plant-breeding programs. We report, for the first 
      time, experiments with Fragaria chiloensis (L.) Duch. and the estimation of the 
      effects of response to salinity stress (0, 30, and 60 mmol NaCl/L) in terms of 
      these pigments content and gas exchange. It is shown that both pigments (which 
      interestingly, themselves show a high correlation) give a good indication of 
      stress response. Both pigments can be accurately predicted using spectral 
      reflectance indices (SRI); however, the accuracy of the predictions was slightly 
      improved using multilinear regression analysis models and genetic algorithm 
      analysis. Specifically for chlorophyll content, unlike other species, the use of 
      published SRI gave better indications of stress response than Normalized 
      Difference Vegetation Index. The effect of salt on gas exchange is only evident 
      at the highest concentration and some SRI gave better prediction performance than 
      the known Photochemical Reflectance Index. This information will therefore be 
      useful for identifying tolerant genotypes to salt stress for incorporation in 
      breeding programs.

AB  - Addressing the functionality of genomes is one of the most important and 
      challenging tasks of today's biology. In particular the ability to link genotypes 
      to corresponding phenotypes is of interest in the reconstruction and 
      biotechnological manipulation of metabolic pathways. Over the last years, the 
      OmniLog™ Phenotype Microarray (PM) technology has been used to address many 
      specific issues related to the metabolic functionality of microorganisms. 
      However, computational tools that could directly link PM data with the gene(s) of 
      interest followed by the extraction of information on gene-phenotype correlation 
      are still missing. Here we present DuctApe, a suite that allows the analysis of 
      both genomic sequences and PM data, to find metabolic differences among PM 
      experiments and to correlate them with KEGG pathways and gene presence/absence 
      patterns. As example, an application of the program to four bacterial datasets is 
      presented. The source code and tutorials are available at 
      http://combogenomics.github.io/DuctApe/.

TI  - bHLH05 is an interaction partner of MYB51 and a novel regulator of glucosinolate 
      biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 349-69
LID - 10.1104/pp.114.240887 [doi]
AB  - By means of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid screening, we identified 
      basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor05 (bHLH05) as an interacting partner 
      of MYB51, the key regulator of indolic glucosinolates (GSLs) in Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana). Furthermore, we show that bHLH04, bHLH05, and bHLH06/MYC2 
      also interact with other R2R3-MYBs regulating GSL biosynthesis. Analysis of bhlh 
      loss-of-function mutants revealed that the single bhlh mutants retained GSL 
      levels that were similar to those in wild-type plants, whereas the triple 
      bhlh04/05/06 mutant was depleted in the production of GSL. Unlike bhlh04/06 and 
      bhlh05/06 mutants, the double bhlh04/05 mutant was strongly affected in the 
      production of GSL, pointing to a special role of bHLH04 and bHLH05 in the control 
      of GSL levels in the absence of jasmonic acid. The combination of two specific 
      gain-of-function alleles of MYB and bHLH proteins had an additive effect on GSL 
      levels, as demonstrated by the analysis of the double MYB34-1D bHLH05D94N mutant, 
      which produces 20-fold more indolic GSLs than bHLH05D94N and ecotype Columbia-0 
      of Arabidopsis. The amino acid substitution D94N in bHLH05D94N negatively affects 
      the interaction with JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN protein, thereby resulting in 
      constitutive activation of bHLH05 and mimicking jasmonic acid treatment. Our 
      study revealed the bHLH04, bHLH05, and bHLH06/MYC2 factors as novel regulators of 
      GSL biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.

AB  - We simulate the competitive uptake and transport of a mixed salt system in the 
      differentiated tissues of plant roots. The results are based on a physical model 
      that includes both forced diffusion and convection by the transpiration stream. 
      The influence of the Casparian strip on regulating apoplastic flow, the focus of 
      the paper, is modelled by varying ion diffusive permeabilities, hydraulic 
      reflection coefficients and water permeability for transport across the 
      endodermis-pericycle interface. We find that reducing diffusive permeabilities 
      leads to significantly altered ion concentration profiles in the pericycle and 
      vascular cylinder regions, while increased convective reflectivities affect 
      predominantly ion concentrations in the cortex and endodermis tissues. The 
      self-consistent electric field arising from ion separation is a major influence 
      on predicted ion fluxes and accumulation rates.

AB  - The Antarctic strain Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 is one of the model 
      organisms of cold-adapted bacteria and is currently exploited as a new 
      alternative expression host for numerous biotechnological applications. Here, we 
      investigated several metabolic features of this strain through in silico 
      modelling and functional integration of -omics data. A genome-scale metabolic 
      model of P. haloplanktis TAC125 was reconstructed, encompassing information on 
      721 genes, 1133 metabolites and 1322 reactions. The predictive potential of this 
      model was validated against a set of experimentally determined growth rates and a 
      large dataset of growth phenotypic data. Furthermore, evidence synthesis from 
      proteomics, phenomics, physiology and metabolic modelling data revealed possible 
      drawbacks of cold-dependent changes in gene expression on the overall metabolic 
      network of P. haloplanktis TAC125. These included, for example, variations in its 
      central metabolism, amino acid degradation and fatty acid biosynthesis. The 
      genome-scale metabolic model described here is the first one reconstructed so far 
      for an Antarctic microbial strain. It allowed a system-level investigation of 
      variations in cellular metabolic fluxes following a temperature downshift. It 
      represents a valuable platform for further investigations on 
      P. haloplanktis TAC125 cellular functional states and for the design of more 
      focused strategies for its possible biotechnological exploitation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To harmonize standard operating procedures (SOPs) and standardize the 
      recording of associated data for collection, processing, and storage of human 
      tissues relevant to endometriosis. DESIGN: An international collaboration 
      involving 34 clinical/academic centers and three industry collaborators from 16 
      countries on five continents. SETTING: In 2013, two workshops were conducted 
      followed by global consultation, bringing together 54 leaders in endometriosis 
      research and sample processing from around the world. PATIENT(S): None. 
      INTERVENTION(S): Consensus SOPs were based on: 1) systematic comparison of SOPs 
      from 24 global centers collecting tissue samples from women with and without 
      endometriosis on a medium or large scale (publication on >100 cases); 2) 
      literature evidence where available, or consultation with laboratory experts 
      otherwise; and 3) several global consultation rounds. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): 
      Standard recommended and minimum required SOPs for tissue collection, processing, 
      and storage in endometriosis research. RESULT(S): We developed "recommended 
      standard" and "minimum required" SOPs for the collection, processing, and storage 
      of ectopic and eutopic endometrium, peritoneum, and myometrium, and a biospecimen 
      data collection form necessary for interpretation of sample-derived results. 
      CONCLUSION(S): The EPHect SOPs allow endometriosis research centers to decrease 
      variability in tissue-based results, facilitating between-center comparisons and 
      collaborations. The procedures are also relevant to research into other 
      gynecologic conditions involving endometrium, myometrium, and peritoneum. The 
      consensus SOPs are based on the best available evidence; areas with limited 
      evidence are identified as requiring further pilot studies. The SOPs will be 
      reviewed based on investigator feedback and through systematic triannual 
      follow-up. Updated versions will be made available at: 
      http://endometriosisfoundation.org/ephect.

TI  - Zinc-finger protein ZFP318 is essential for expression of IgD, the alternatively 
      spliced Igh product made by mature B lymphocytes.
PG  - 4513-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1402739111 [doi]
AB  - IgD and IgM are produced by alternative splicing of long primary RNA transcripts 
      from the Ig heavy chain (Igh) locus and serve as the receptors for antigen on 
      naïve mature B lymphocytes. IgM is made selectively in immature B cells, whereas 
      IgD is coexpressed with IgM when the cells mature into follicular or marginal 
      zone B cells, but the transacting factors responsible for this regulated change 
      in splicing have remained elusive. Here, we use a genetic screen in mice to 
      identify ZFP318, a nuclear protein with two U1-type zinc fingers found in 
      RNA-binding proteins and no known role in the immune system, as a critical factor 
      for IgD expression. A point mutation in an evolutionarily conserved lysine-rich 
      domain encoded by the alternatively spliced Zfp318 exon 10 abolished IgD 
      expression on marginal zone B cells, decreased IgD on follicular B cells, and 
      increased IgM, but only slightly decreased the percentage of B cells and did not 
      decrease expression of other maturation markers CD21, CD23, or CD62L. A targeted 
      Zfp318 null allele extinguished IgD expression on mature B cells and increased 
      IgM. Zfp318 mRNA is developmentally regulated in parallel with IgD, with little 
      in pro-B cells, moderate amounts in immature B cells, and high levels selectively 
      in mature follicular B cells. These findings identify ZFP318 as a crucial factor 
      regulating the expression of the two major antibody isotypes on the surface of 
      most mature B cells.

TI  - Auras in generalized epilepsy.
PG  - 1444-9
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000877 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the frequency of auras in generalized epilepsy (GE) using a 
      detailed semistructured diagnostic interview. METHODS: In this cross-sectional 
      study, participants with GE were drawn from the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project 
      (EPGP). Responses to the standardized diagnostic interview regarding tonic-clonic 
      (grand mal) seizures were then examined. This questionnaire initially required 
      participants to provide their own description of any subjective phenomena before 
      their "grand mal seizures." Participants who provided answers to these questions 
      were considered to have an aura. All participants were then systematically 
      queried regarding a list of specific symptoms occurring before grand mal 
      seizures, using structured (closed-ended) questions. RESULTS: Seven hundred 
      ninety-eight participants with GE were identified, of whom 530 reported grand mal 
      seizures. Of these, 112 (21.3%) reported auras in response to the open-ended 
      question. Analysis of responses to the closed-ended questions suggested that 341 
      participants (64.3%) experienced at least one form of aura. CONCLUSIONS: Auras 
      typically associated with focal epilepsy were reported by a substantial 
      proportion of EPGP subjects with GE. This finding may support existing theories 
      of cortical and subcortical generators of GE with variable spread patterns. 
      Differences between responses to the open-ended question and closed-ended 
      questions may also reflect clinically relevant variation in patient responses to 
      history-taking and surveys. Open-ended questions may underestimate the prevalence 
      of specific types of auras and may be in part responsible for the 
      underrecognition of auras in GE. In addition, structured questions may influence 
      participants, possibly leading to a greater representation of symptoms.

TI  - Integrating omic approaches for abiotic stress tolerance in soybean.
PG  - 244
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2014.00244 [doi]
LID - 244
AB  - Soybean production is greatly influenced by abiotic stresses imposed by 
      environmental factors such as drought, water submergence, salt, and heavy metals. 
      A thorough understanding of plant response to abiotic stress at the molecular 
      level is a prerequisite for its effective management. The molecular mechanism of 
      stress tolerance is complex and requires information at the omic level to 
      understand it effectively. In this regard, enormous progress has been made in the 
      omics field in the areas of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. The 
      emerging field of ionomics is also being employed for investigating abiotic 
      stress tolerance in soybean. Omic approaches generate a huge amount of data, and 
      adequate advancements in computational tools have been achieved for effective 
      analysis. However, the integration of omic-scale information to address complex 
      genetics and physiological questions is still a challenge. In this review, we 
      have described advances in omic tools in the view of conventional and modern 
      approaches being used to dissect abiotic stress tolerance in soybean. Emphasis 
      was given to approaches such as quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, 
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and genomic selection (GS). Comparative 
      genomics and candidate gene approaches are also discussed considering 
      identification of potential genomic loci, genes, and biochemical pathways 
      involved in stress tolerance mechanism in soybean. This review also provides a 
      comprehensive catalog of available online omic resources for soybean and its 
      effective utilization. We have also addressed the significance of phenomics in 
      the integrated approaches and recognized high-throughput multi-dimensional 
      phenotyping as a major limiting factor for the improvement of abiotic stress 
      tolerance in soybean.

TI  - Open reading frames associated with cancer in the dark matter of the human 
      genome.
PG  - 201-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: The uncharacterized proteins (open reading frames, ORFs) in the human 
      genome offer an opportunity to discover novel targets for cancer. A systematic 
      analysis of the dark matter of the human proteome for druggability and biomarker 
      discovery is crucial to mining the genome. Numerous data mining tools are 
      available to mine these ORFs to develop a comprehensive knowledge base for future 
      target discovery and validation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Genetic 
      Association Database, the ORFs of the human dark matter proteome were screened 
      for evidence of association with neoplasms. The Phenome-Genome Integrator tool 
      was used to establish phenotypic association with disease traits including 
      cancer. Batch analysis of the tools for protein expression analysis, gene 
      ontology and motifs and domains was used to characterize the ORFs. RESULTS: 
      Sixty-two ORFs were identified for neoplasm association. The expression 
      Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) analysis identified thirteen ORFs related to 
      cancer traits. Protein expression, motifs and domain analysis and genome-wide 
      association studies verified the relevance of these OncoORFs in diverse tumors. 
      The OncoORFs are also associated with a wide variety of human diseases and 
      disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our results link the OncoORFs to diverse diseases and 
      disorders. This suggests a complex landscape of the uncharacterized proteome in 
      human diseases. These results open the dark matter of the proteome to novel 
      cancer target research.

TI  - Meta-omic platforms to assist in the understanding of NAFLD gut microbiota 
      alterations: tools and applications.
PG  - 684-711
LID - 10.3390/ijms15010684 [doi]
AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic 
      liver disease worldwide as a result of the increasing prevalence of obesity, 
      starting from early life stages. It is characterized by a spectrum of liver 
      diseases ranging from simple fatty liver (NAFL) to steatohepatitis (NASH), with a 
      possible progression to fibrosis, thus increasing liver-related morbidity and 
      mortality. NAFLD development is driven by the co-action of several risk factors, 
      including obesity and metabolic syndrome, which may be both genetically induced 
      and diet-related. Recently, particular attention has been paid to the gut-liver 
      axis, which may play a physio-pathological role in the onset and progression of 
      the disease. The gut microbiota is intended to act as a bioreactor that can 
      guarantee autonomous metabolic and immunological functions and that can drive 
      functional strategies within the environment of the body in response to external 
      stimuli. The complexity of the gut microbiota suggests that it behaves as an 
      organ. Therefore, the concept of the gut-liver axis must be complemented with the 
      gut-microbiota-liver network due to the high intricacy of the microbiota 
      components and metabolic activities; these activities form the active diet-driven 
      power plant of the host. Such complexity can only be revealed using systems 
      biology, which can integrate clinical phenomics and gut microbiota data.

TI  - The nutritional phenome of EMT-induced cancer stem-like cells.
PG  - 3970-82
AB  - The metabolic features of cancer stem (CS) cells and the effects of specific 
      nutrients or metabolites on CS cells remain mostly unexplored. A preliminary 
      study to delineate the nutritional phenome of CS cells exploited the landmark 
      observation that upon experimental induction into an epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
      (EMT) transition, the proportion of CS-like cells drastically increases within a 
      breast cancer cell population. EMT-induced CS-like cells (HMLERshEcad) and 
      isogenic parental cells (HMLERshCntrol) were simultaneously screened for their 
      ability to generate energy-rich NADH when cultured in a standardized 
      high-throughput metabolic phenotyping platform comprising >350 wells that were 
      pre-loaded with different carbohydrates/starches, alcohols, fatty acids, ketones, 
      carboxylic acids, amino acids, and bi-amino acids. The generation of "phenetic 
      maps" of the carbon and nitrogen utilization patterns revealed that the 
      acquisition of a CS-like cellular state provided an enhanced ability to utilize 
      additional catabolic fuels, especially under starvation conditions. Crucially, 
      the acquisition of cancer stemness activated a metabolic infrastructure that 
      enabled the vectorial transfer of high-energy nutrients such as glycolysis end 
      products (pyruvate, lactate) and bona fide ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate) from 
      the extracellular microenvironment to support mitochondrial energy production in 
      CS-like cells. Metabolic reprogramming may thus constitute an efficient adaptive 
      strategy through which CS-like cells would rapidly obtain an advantage in hostile 
      conditions such as nutrient starvation following the inhibition of tumor 
      angiogenesis. By understanding how specific nutrients could bioenergetically 
      boost EMT-CS-like phenotypes, "smart foods" or systemic "metabolic 
      nichotherapies" may be tailored to specific nutritional CSC phenomes, whereas 
      high-resolution heavy isotope-labeled nutrient tracking may be developed to 
      monitor the spatiotemporal distribution and functionality of CS-like cells in 
      real time.

AB  - In the current study, a number of salt-tolerant clones previously isolated from a 
      human gut metagenomic library were screened using Phenotype MicroArray (PM) 
      technology to assess their functional capacity. PM's can be used to study gene 
      function, pathogenicity, metabolic capacity and identify drug targets using a 
      series of specialized microtitre plate assays, where each well of the microtitre 
      plate contains a different set of conditions and tests a different phenotype. 
      Cellular respiration is monitored colorimetrically by the reduction of a 
      tetrazolium dye. One clone, SMG 9, was found to be positive for 
      utilization/transport of L-carnitine (a well-characterized osmoprotectant) in the 
      presence of 6% w/v sodium chloride (NaCl). Subsequent experiments revealed a 
      significant growth advantage in minimal media containing NaCl and L-carnitine. 
      Fosmid sequencing revealed putative candidate genes responsible for the 
      phenotype. Subsequent cloning of two genes did not replicate the 
      L-carnitine-associated phenotype, although one of the genes, a σ(54)-dependent 
      transcriptional regulator, did confer salt tolerance to Escherichia coli when 
      expressed in isolation. The original clone, SMG 9, was subsequently found to have 
      lost the original observed phenotype upon further investigation. Nevertheless, 
      this study demonstrates the usefulness of a phenomic approach to assign a 
      functional role to metagenome-derived clones.

AB  - Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) have demonstrated utility in validating 
      genetic associations derived from traditional genetic studies as well as 
      identifying novel genetic associations. Here we used an electronic health record 
      (EHR)-based PheWAS to explore pleiotropy of genetic variants in the fat mass and 
      obesity associated gene (FTO), some of which have been previously associated with 
      obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We used a population of 10,487 individuals of 
      European ancestry with genome-wide genotyping from the Electronic Medical Records 
      and Genomics (eMERGE) Network and another population of 13,711 individuals of 
      European ancestry from the BioVU DNA biobank at Vanderbilt genotyped using 
      Illumina HumanExome BeadChip. A meta-analysis of the two study populations 
      replicated the well-described associations between FTO variants and obesity (odds 
      ratio [OR] = 1.25, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.11-1.24, p = 2.10 × 10(-9)) and 
      FTO variants and T2D (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.08-1.21, p = 2.34 × 10(-6)). The 
      meta-analysis also demonstrated that FTO variant rs8050136 was significantly 
      associated with sleep apnea (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.07-1.22, p = 3.33 × 10(-5)); 
      however, the association was attenuated after adjustment for body mass index 
      (BMI). Novel phenotype associations with obesity-associated FTO variants included 
      fibrocystic breast disease (rs9941349, OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.74-0.91, p = 5.41 × 
      10(-5)) and trends toward associations with non-alcoholic liver disease and 
      gram-positive bacterial infections. FTO variants not associated with obesity 
      demonstrated other potential disease associations including non-inflammatory 
      disorders of the cervix and chronic periodontitis. These results suggest that 
      genetic variants in FTO may have pleiotropic associations, some of which are not 
      mediated by obesity.

AB  - Copy number variants (CNVs) are associated with many neurocognitive disorders; 
      however, these events are typically large, and the underlying causative genes are 
      unclear. We created an expanded CNV morbidity map from 29,085 children with 
      developmental delay in comparison to 19,584 healthy controls, identifying 70 
      significant CNVs. We resequenced 26 candidate genes in 4,716 additional cases 
      with developmental delay or autism and 2,193 controls. An integrated analysis of 
      CNV and single-nucleotide variant (SNV) data pinpointed 10 genes enriched for 
      putative loss of function. Follow-up of a subset of affected individuals 
      identified new clinical subtypes of pediatric disease and the genes responsible 
      for disease-associated CNVs. These genetic changes include haploinsufficiency of 
      SETBP1 associated with intellectual disability and loss of expressive language 
      and truncations of ZMYND11 in individuals with autism, aggression and complex 
      neuropsychiatric features. This combined CNV and SNV approach facilitates the 
      rapid discovery of new syndromes and genes involved in neuropsychiatric disease 
      despite extensive genetic heterogeneity.

TI  - Transcriptome profiling identifies ABA mediated regulatory changes towards 
      storage filling in developing seeds of castor bean (Ricinus communis L.).
PG  - 33
LID - 10.1186/2045-3701-4-33 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential biodiesel plant castor bean (Ricinus communis) has been 
      in the limelight for bioenergy research due to the availability of its genome 
      which raises the bar for genome-wide studies claiming advances that impact the 
      "genome-phenome challenge". Here we report the application of phytohormone ABA as 
      an exogenous factor for the improvement of storage reserve accumulation with a 
      focus on the complex interaction of pathways associated with seed filling. 
      RESULTS: After the application of exogenous ABA treatments, we measured an 
      increased ABA levels in the developing seeds cultured in vitro using the ELISA 
      technique and quantified the content of major biomolecules (including total 
      lipids, sugars and protein) in treated seeds. Exogenous ABA (10 μM) enhanced the 
      accumulation of soluble sugar content (6.3%) followed by deposition of total 
      lipid content (4.9 %). To elucidate the possible ABA signal transduction pathways 
      towards overall seed filling, we studied the differential gene expression 
      analysis using Illumina RNA-Sequencing technology, resulting in 2568 
      (1507-up/1061-down regulated) differentially expressed genes were identified. 
      These genes were involved in sugar metabolism (such as glucose-6-phosphate, 
      fructose 1,6 bis-phosphate, glycerol-3-phosphate, pyruvate kinase), lipid 
      biosynthesis (such as ACS, ACBP, GPAT2, GPAT3, FAD2, FAD3, SAD1 and DGAT1), 
      storage proteins synthesis (such as SGP1, zinc finger protein, RING H2 protein, 
      nodulin 55 and cytochrome P450), and ABA biosynthesis (such as NCED1, NCED3 and 
      beta carotene). Further, we confirmed the validation of RNA-Sequencing data by 
      Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, metabolite 
      measurements supported by genes and pathway expression results indicated in this 
      study provide new insights to understand the ABA signaling mechanism towards seed 
      storage filling and also contribute useful information for facilitating oilseed 
      crop functional genomics on an aim for utilizing castor bean agricultural and 
      bioenergy use.

TI  - R PheWAS: data analysis and plotting tools for phenome-wide association studies 
      in the R environment.
PG  - 2375-6
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu197 [doi]
AB  - Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) have been used to replicate known 
      genetic associations and discover new phenotype associations for genetic 
      variants. This PheWAS implementation allows users to translate ICD-9 codes to 
      PheWAS case and control groups, perform analyses using these and/or other 
      phenotypes with covariate adjustments and plot the results. We demonstrate the 
      methods by replicating a PheWAS on rs3135388 (near HLA-DRB, associated with 
      multiple sclerosis) and performing a novel PheWAS using an individual's maximum 
      white blood cell count (WBC) as a continuous measure. Our results for rs3135388 
      replicate known associations with more significant results than the original 
      study on the same dataset. Our PheWAS of WBC found expected results, including 
      associations with infections, myeloproliferative diseases and associated 
      conditions, such as anemia. These results demonstrate the performance of the 
      improved classification scheme and the flexibility of PheWAS encapsulated in this 
      package. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: This R package is freely available 
      under the Gnu Public License (GPL-3) from http://phewascatalog.org. It is 
      implemented in native R and is platform independent.

LID - 10.1016/j.yebeh.2014.09.051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing interest in sex differences in disease 
      manifestations and responses to treatment, very few data are available on sex 
      differences in seizure types and semiology. The Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project 
      (EPGP) is a large-scale, multi-institutional, collaborative study that aims to 
      create a comprehensive repository of detailed clinical information and DNA 
      samples from a large cohort of people with epilepsy. We used this 
      well-characterized cohort to explore differences in seizure types as well as 
      focal seizure symptoms between males and females. METHODS: We reviewed the EPGP 
      database and identified individuals with generalized epilepsy of unknown etiology 
      (GE) (n = 760; female: 446, male: 314), nonacquired focal epilepsy (NAFE) (n = 
      476; female: 245, male: 231), or both (n = 64; female: 33, male: 31). Demographic 
      data along with characterization of seizure type and focal seizure semiologies 
      were examined. RESULTS: In GE, males reported atonic seizures more frequently 
      than females (6.5% vs. 1.7%; p < 0.001). No differences were observed in other 
      generalized seizure types. In NAFE, no sex differences were seen for seizure 
      types with or without alteration of consciousness or progression to secondary 
      generalization. Autonomic (16.4% vs. 26.6%; p = 0.005), psychic (26.7% vs. 40.3%; 
      p = 0.001), and visual (10.3% vs. 19.9%; p = 0.002) symptoms were more frequently 
      reported in females than males. Specifically, of psychic symptoms, more females 
      than males endorsed déjà vu (p = 0.001) but not forced thoughts, 
      derealization/depersonalization, jamais vu, or fear. With corrections for 
      multiple comparisons, there were no significant differences in aphasic, motor, 
      somatosensory, gustatory, olfactory, auditory, vertiginous, or ictal headache 
      symptoms between sexes. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences between the sexes 
      were observed in the reporting of atonic seizures, which were more common in 
      males with GE, and for autonomic, visual, and psychic symptoms associated with 
      NAFE, which were more common in females.

AB  - Significant cognitive dysfunction has been recognized as an important state and 
      trait feature of bipolar disorder. In this article, longitudinal studies 
      comparing cognitive performance in bipolar disorder patients and healthy controls 
      are reviewed. In contrast to cross-sectional reports, current longitudinal 
      research findings do not support a progressive cognitive decline over time. 
      However, a higher within-person instability in cognitive performance was found 
      relative to controls. The need for larger samples remains, as well as for longer 
      and more frequent observations.

AB  - Most neuroactive drugs were discovered through unexpected behavioral 
      observations. Systematic behavioral screening is inefficient in most model 
      organisms. But, automated technologies are enabling a new phase of 
      discovery-based research in central nervous system (CNS) pharmacology. 
      Researchers are using large-scale behavior-based chemical screens in zebrafish to 
      discover compounds with new structures, targets, and functions. These compounds 
      are powerful tools for understanding CNS signaling pathways. Substantial 
      differences between human and zebrafish biology will make it difficult to 
      translate these discoveries to clinical medicine. However, given the molecular 
      genetic similarities between humans and zebrafish, it is likely that some of 
      these compounds will have translational utility. We predict that the greatest new 
      successes in CNS drug discovery will leverage many model systems, including in 
      vitro assays, cells, rodents, and zebrafish.

AB  - Agriculture requires a second green revolution to provide increased food, fodder, 
      fiber, fuel and soil fertility for a growing population while being more 
      resilient to extreme weather on finite land, water, and nutrient resources. 
      Advances in phenomics, genomics and environmental control/sensing can now be used 
      to directly select yield and resilience traits from large collections of 
      germplasm if software can integrate among the technologies. Traits could be 
      Captured throughout development and across environments from multi-dimensional 
      phenotypes, by applying Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to identify causal 
      genes and background variation and functional structural plant models (FSPMs) to 
      predict plant growth and reproduction in target environments. TraitCapture should 
      be applicable to both controlled and field environments and would allow breeders 
      to simulate regional variety trials to pre-select for increased productivity 
      under challenging environments.

AB  - The Human Proteome Project (HPP) is designed to generate a comprehensive map of 
      the protein-based molecular architecture of the human body, to provide a resource 
      to help elucidate biological and molecular function, and to advance diagnosis and 
      treatment of diseases. Within this framework, the chromosome-based HPP (C-HPP) 
      has allocated responsibility for mapping individual chromosomes by country or 
      region, while the biology/disease HPP (B/D-HPP) coordinates these teams in 
      cross-functional disease-based groups. Chromosome 6 (Ch6) provides an excellent 
      model for integration of these two tasks. This metacentric chromosome has a 
      complement of 1002-1034 genes that code for known, novel or putative proteins. 
      Ch6 is functionally associated with more than 120 major human diseases, many with 
      high population prevalence, devastating clinical impact and profound societal 
      consequences. The unique combination of genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, phenomic 
      and health services data being drawn together within the Ch6 program has enormous 
      potential to advance personalized medicine by promoting robust biomarkers, 
      subunit vaccines and new drug targets. The strong liaison between the clinical 
      and laboratory teams, and the structured framework for technology transfer and 
      health policy decisions within Canada will increase the speed and efficacy of 
      this transition, and the value of this translational research. BIOLOGICAL 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Canada has been selected to play a leading role in the 
      international Human Proteome Project, the global counterpart of the Human Genome 
      Project designed to understand the structure and function of the human proteome 
      in health and disease. Canada will lead an international team focusing on 
      chromosome 6, which is functionally associated with more than 120 major human 
      diseases, including immune and inflammatory disorders affecting the brain, 
      skeletal system, heart and blood vessels, lungs, kidney, liver, gastrointestinal 
      tract and endocrine system. Many of these chronic and persistent diseases have a 
      high population prevalence, devastating clinical impact and profound societal 
      consequences. As a result, they impose a multi-billion dollar economic burden on 
      Canada and on all advanced societies through direct costs of patient care, the 
      loss of health and productivity, and extensive caregiver burden. There is no 
      definitive treatment at the present time for any of these disorders. The 
      manuscript outlines the research which will involve a systematic assessment of 
      all chromosome 6 genes, development of a knowledge base, and development of 
      assays and reagents for all chromosome 6 proteins. We feel that the informatic 
      infrastructure and MRM assays developed will place the chromosome 6 consortium in 
      an excellent position to be a leading player in this major international research 
      initiative. This article is part of a Special Issue: Can Proteomics Fill the Gap 
      Between Genomics and Phenotypes?

AB  - Understanding the source of genetic variation in aging and using this variation 
      to define the molecular mechanisms of healthy aging require deep and broad 
      quantification of a host of physiological, morphological, and behavioral 
      endpoints. The murine model is a powerful system in which to understand the 
      relations across age-related phenotypes and to identify research models with 
      variation in life span and health span. The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock 
      Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging has performed broad 
      characterization of aging in genetically diverse laboratory mice and has placed 
      these data, along with data from several other major aging initiatives, into the 
      interactive Mouse Phenome Database. The data may be accessed and analyzed by 
      researchers interested in finding mouse models for specific aging processes, 
      age-related health and disease states, and for genetic analysis of aging 
      variation and trait covariation. We expect that by placing these data in the 
      hands of the aging community that there will be (a) accelerated genetic analyses 
      of aging processes, (b) discovery of genetic loci regulating life span, (c) 
      identification of compelling correlations between life span and susceptibility 
      for age-related disorders, and (d) discovery of concordant genomic loci 
      influencing life span and aging phenotypes between mouse and humans.

      population. It has been explored particularly in its relationship with the genome 
      to identify correlations for diseases. The phenome has been also explored for 
      drug repositioning with efforts focusing on the search space for the most similar 
      candidate drugs. For a comprehensive analysis of the phenome, we assumed that all 
      phenotypes (indications and side effects) were inter-connected with a 
      probabilistic distribution and this characteristic may offer an opportunity to 
      identify new therapeutic indications for a given drug. Correspondingly, we 
      employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which introduces latent variables 
      (topics) to govern the phenome distribution. RESULTS: We developed our model on 
      the phenome information in Side Effect Resource (SIDER). We first developed a LDA 
      model optimized based on its recovery potential through perturbing the 
      drug-phenotype matrix for each of the drug-indication pairs where each 
      drug-indication relationship was switched to "unknown" one at the time and then 
      recovered based on the remaining drug-phenotype pairs. Of the probabilistically 
      significant pairs, 70% was successfully recovered. Next, we applied the model on 
      the whole phenome to narrow down repositioning candidates and suggest alternative 
      indications. We were able to retrieve approved indications of 6 drugs whose 
      indications were not listed in SIDER. For 908 drugs that were present with their 
      indication information, our model suggested alternative treatment options for 
      further investigations. Several of the suggested new uses can be supported with 
      information from the scientific literature. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated 
      that the phenome can be further analyzed by a generative model, which can 
      discover probabilistic associations between drugs and therapeutic uses. In this 
      regard, LDA serves as an enrichment tool to explore new uses of existing drugs by 
      narrowing down the search space.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disease in which efforts to 
      define subtypes behaviorally have met with limited success. Hypothesizing that 
      genetically based subtype identification may prove more productive, we 
      resequenced the ASD-associated gene CHD8 in 3,730 children with developmental 
      delay or ASD. We identified a total of 15 independent mutations; no truncating 
      events were identified in 8,792 controls, including 2,289 unaffected siblings. In 
      addition to a high likelihood of an ASD diagnosis among patients bearing CHD8 
      mutations, characteristics enriched in this group included macrocephaly, distinct 
      faces, and gastrointestinal complaints. chd8 disruption in zebrafish 
      recapitulates features of the human phenotype, including increased head size as a 
      result of expansion of the forebrain/midbrain and impairment of gastrointestinal 
      motility due to a reduction in postmitotic enteric neurons. Our findings indicate 
      that CHD8 disruptions define a distinct ASD subtype and reveal unexpected 
      comorbidities between brain development and enteric innervation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To standardize the recording of surgical phenotypic information on 
      endometriosis and related sample collections obtained at laparoscopy, allowing 
      large-scale collaborative research into the condition. DESIGN: An international 
      collaboration involving 34 clinical/academic centers and three industry 
      collaborators from 16 countries. SETTING: Two workshops were conducted in 2013, 
      bringing together 54 clinical, academic, and industry leaders in endometriosis 
      research and management worldwide. PATIENT(S): None. INTERVENTION(S): A 
      postsurgical scoring sheet containing general and gynecological patient and 
      procedural information, extent of disease, the location and type of endometriotic 
      lesion, and any other findings was developed during several rounds of review. 
      Comments and any systematic surgical data collection tools used in the reviewers' 
      centers were incorporated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The development of a standard 
      recommended (SSF) and minimum required (MSF) form to collect data on the surgical 
      phenotype of endometriosis. RESULT(S): SSF and MSF include detailed descriptions 
      of lesions, modes of procedures and sample collection, comorbidities, and 
      potential residual disease at the end of surgery, along with previously published 
      instruments such as the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine and 
      Endometriosis Fertility Index classification tools for comparison and validation. 
      CONCLUSION(S): This is the first multicenter, international collaboration between 
      academic centers and industry addressing standardization of phenotypic data 
      collection for a specific disease. The Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking 
      Harmonisation Project SSF and MSF are essential tools to increase our 
      understanding of the pathogenesis of endometriosis by allowing large-scale 
      collaborative research into the condition.

AB  - Finding genetic variants that contribute to phenotypic variation is one of the 
      main challenges of modern genetics. We used an outbred population of rats 
      (Heterogeneous Stock, HS) in a combined sequence-based and genetic mapping 
      analysis to identify sequence variants and genes contributing to complex traits 
      of biomedical relevance. Here we describe the sequences of the eight inbred 
      progenitors of the HS and the variants that segregate between them. We report the 
      genotyping of 1,407 HS rats, and the collection from 2,006 rats of 195 phenotypic 
      measures that are relevant to models of anxiety, type 2 diabetes, hypertension 
      and osteoporosis. We make available haplotype dosages for the 1,407 genotyped 
      rats, since genetic mapping in the HS is best carried out by reconstructing each 
      HS chromosome as a mosaic of the progenitor genomes. Finally, we have deposited 
      an R object that makes it easy to incorporate our sequence data into any genetic 
      study of HS rats. Our genetic data are available for both Rnor3.4 and Rnor5.0 rat 
      assemblies.

TI  - Identifying feasible metabolic routes in Mycobacterium smegmatis and possible 
      alterations under diverse nutrient conditions.
PG  - 276
LID - 10.1186/s12866-014-0276-5 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies on M. tuberculosis have emerged from using M. smegmatis 
      MC(2)155 (Msm), since they share significant similarities and yet Msm is 
      non-pathogenic and faster growing. Although several individual molecules have 
      been studied from Msm, many questions remain open about its metabolism as a whole 
      and its capability to be versatile. Adaptability and versatility are emergent 
      properties of a system, warranting a molecular systems perspective to understand 
      them. RESULTS: We identify feasible metabolic pathways in Msm in reference 
      condition with transcriptome, phenotypic microarray, along with functional 
      annotation of the genome. Together with transcriptome data, specific genes from a 
      set of alternatives have been mapped onto different pathways. About 257 metabolic 
      pathways can be considered to be feasible in Msm. Next, we probe cellular 
      metabolism with an array of alternative carbon and nitrogen sources and identify 
      those that are utilized and favour growth as well as those that do not support 
      growth. In all, about 135 points in the entire metabolic map are probed. 
      Analyzing growth patterns under these conditions, lead us to hypothesize 
      different pathways that can become active in various conditions and possible 
      alternate routes that may be induced, thus explaining the observed physiological 
      adaptations. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides the first detailed analysis of 
      feasible pathways towards adaptability. We obtain mechanistic insights that 
      explain observed phenotypic behaviour by studying gene-expression profiles and 
      pathways inferred from the genome sequence. Comparison of transcriptome and 
      phenome analysis of Msm and Mtb provides a rationale for understanding 
      commonalities in metabolic adaptability.

AB  - Following the invention of the first computed tomography (CT) scanner in the 
      early 1970s, many innovations in three-dimensional (3D) diagnostic imaging 
      technology have occurred, leading to a wide range of applications in craniofacial 
      clinical practice and research. Three-dimensional image analysis provides 
      superior and more detailed information compared with conventional plain 
      two-dimensional (2D) radiography, with the added benefit of 3D printing for 
      preoperative treatment planning and regenerative therapy. Current 
      state-of-the-art multidetector CT (MDCT), also known as medical CT, has an 
      important role in the diagnosis and management of craniofacial injuries and 
      pathology. Three-dimensional cone beam CT (CBCT), pioneered in the 1990s, is 
      gaining increasing popularity in dental and craniofacial clinical practice 
      because of its faster image acquisition at a lower radiation dose, but sound 
      guidelines are needed to ensure its optimal clinical use. Recent innovations in 
      micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) have revolutionized craniofacial biology 
      research by enabling higher resolution scanning of teeth beyond the capabilities 
      of MDCT and CBCT, presenting new prospects for translational clinical research. 
      Even after four decades of refinement, CT technology continues to advance and 
      broaden the horizons of craniofacial clinical practice and phenomics research.

TI  - Clinical practice guidelines for translating pharmacogenomic knowledge to 
      bedside. Focus on anticancer drugs.
PG  - 188
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2014.00188 [doi]
LID - 188
AB  - The development of clinical practice recommendations or guidelines for the 
      clinical use of pharmacogenomics data is an essential issue for improving drug 
      therapy, particularly for drugs with high toxicity and/or narrow therapeutic 
      index such as anticancer drugs. Although pharmacogenomic-based recommendations 
      have been formulated for over 40 anticancer drugs, the number of clinical 
      practice guidelines available is very low. The guidelines already published 
      indicate that pharmacogenomic testing is useful for patient selection, but final 
      dosing adjustment should be carried out on the basis of clinical or analytical 
      parameters rather than on pharmacogenomic information. Patient selection may seem 
      a modest objective, but it constitutes a crucial improvement with regard to the 
      pre-pharmacogenomics situation and it saves patients' lives. However, we should 
      not overstate the current power of pharmacogenomics. At present the 
      pharmacogenomics of anticancer drugs is not sufficiently developed for dose 
      adjustments based on pharmacogenomics only, and no current guidelines recommend 
      such adjustments without considering clinical and/or analytical parameters. This 
      objective, if ever attained, would require the use of available guidelines, 
      further implementation with clinical feedback, plus a combination of genomics and 
      phenomics knowledge.

TI  - EHR-based phenome wide association study in pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related 
      deaths in the United States, it is difficult to detect early and typically has a 
      very poor prognosis. We present a novel method of large-scale clinical hypothesis 
      generation based on phenome wide association study performed using Electronic 
      Health Records (EHR) in a pancreatic cancer cohort. METHODS: The study population 
      consisted of 1,154 patients diagnosed with malignant neoplasm of pancreas seen at 
      The Froedtert & The Medical College of Wisconsin academic medical center between 
      the years 2004 and 2013. We evaluated death of a patient as the primary clinical 
      outcome and tested its association with the phenome, which consisted of over 2.5 
      million structured clinical observations extracted out of the EHR including labs, 
      medications, phenotypes, diseases and procedures. The individual observations 
      were encoded in the EHR using 6,617 unique ICD-9, CPT-4, LOINC, and RxNorm codes. 
      We remapped this initial code set into UMLS concepts and then hierarchically 
      expanded to support generalization into the final set of 10,164 clinical 
      concepts, which formed the final phenome. We then tested all possible pairwise 
      associations between any of the original 10,164 concepts and death as the primary 
      outcome. RESULTS: After correcting for multiple testing and folding back 
      (generalizing) child concepts were appropriate, we found 231 concepts to be 
      significantly associated with death in the study population. CONCLUSIONS: With 
      the abundance of structured EHR data, phenome wide association studies combined 
      with knowledge engineering can be a viable method of rapid hypothesis generation.

AB  - Emerging evidence indicates that epileptic encephalopathies are genetically 
      highly heterogeneous, underscoring the need for large cohorts of 
      well-characterized individuals to further define the genetic landscape. Through a 
      collaboration between two consortia (EuroEPINOMICS and Epi4K/EPGP), we analyzed 
      exome-sequencing data of 356 trios with the "classical" epileptic 
      encephalopathies, infantile spasms and Lennox Gastaut syndrome, including 264 
      trios previously analyzed by the Epi4K/EPGP consortium. In this expanded cohort, 
      we find 429 de novo mutations, including de novo mutations in DNM1 in five 
      individuals and de novo mutations in GABBR2, FASN, and RYR3 in two individuals 
      each. Unlike previous studies, this cohort is sufficiently large to show a 
      significant excess of de novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathy probands 
      compared to the general population using a likelihood analysis (p = 8.2 × 
      10(-4)), supporting a prominent role for de novo mutations in epileptic 
      encephalopathies. We bring statistical evidence that mutations in DNM1 cause 
      epileptic encephalopathy, find suggestive evidence for a role of three additional 
      genes, and show that at least 12% of analyzed individuals have an identifiable 
      causal de novo mutation. Strikingly, 75% of mutations in these probands are 
      predicted to disrupt a protein involved in regulating synaptic transmission, and 
      there is a significant enrichment of de novo mutations in genes in this pathway 
      in the entire cohort as well. These findings emphasize an important role for 
      synaptic dysregulation in epileptic encephalopathies, above and beyond that 
      caused by ion channel dysfunction.
