TI  - e-Photosynthesis: a comprehensive dynamic mechanistic model of C3 photosynthesis: 
      from light capture to sucrose synthesis.
PG  - 1711-27
LID - 10.1111/pce.12025 [doi]
AB  - Photosynthesis is arguably the most researched of all plant processes. A dynamic 
      model of leaf photosynthesis that includes each discrete process from light 
      capture to carbohydrate synthesis, e-photosynthesis, is described. It was 
      developed by linking and extending our previous models of photosystem II (PSII) 
      energy transfer and photosynthetic C3 carbon metabolism to include electron 
      transfer processes around photosystem I (PSI), ion transfer between the lumen and 
      stroma, ATP synthesis and NADP reduction to provide a complete representation. 
      Different regulatory processes linking the light and dark reactions are also 
      included: Rubisco activation via Rubisco activase, pH and xanthophyll 
      cycle-dependent non-photochemical quenching mechanisms, as well as the regulation 
      of enzyme activities via the ferredoxin-theoredoxin system. Although many further 
      feedback and feedforward controls undoubtedly exist, it is shown that 
      e-photosynthesis effectively mimics the typical kinetics of leaf CO₂ uptake, O₂ 
      evolution, chlorophyll fluorescence emission, lumen and stromal pH, and membrane 
      potential following perturbations in light, [CO₂] and [O₂] observed in intact C3 
      leaves. The model provides a framework for guiding engineering of improved 
      photosynthetic efficiency, for evaluating multiple non-invasive measures used in 
      emerging phenomics facilities, and for quantitative assessment of strengths and 
      weaknesses within the understanding of photosynthesis as an integrated process.

PG  - 145-9
LID - 10.1038/jhh.2013.67 [doi]
AB  - As a major cardiovascular risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease, heart 
      failure and end-stage renal disease, hypertension affects approximately one 
      billion people and causes large economic burden worldwide. Cytochrome P450 3A5 
      (CYP3A5), belonging to the CYP3A subfamily, has been implicated in the regulation 
      of blood pressure and may serve as a potential risk factor for the development of 
      hypertension. Increased CYP3A5 activity could cause sodium and water retention by 
      affecting the metabolism of cortisol in the kidneys. Furthermore, polymorphic 
      CYP3A5 genotypes have been shown to cause differences in blood pressure response 
      to antihypertensive drugs. Several studies have investigated the role of CYP3A5 
      in blood pressure response to amlodipine. However, recent data on the role of 
      CYP3A5 in hypertension development and treatment are inconsistent. This review 
      summarizes what is known regarding the relationship of CYP3A5 with hypertension, 
      discusses the limitations in present studies, highlights the gaps and directs 
      research to this field.

TI  - Single-cell phenomics reveals intra-species variation of phenotypic noise in 
      yeast.
PG  - 54
LID - 10.1186/1752-0509-7-54 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most quantitative measures of phenotypic traits represent macroscopic 
      contributions of large numbers of cells. Yet, cells of a tissue do not behave 
      similarly, and molecular studies on several organisms have shown that regulations 
      can be highly stochastic, sometimes generating diversified cellular phenotypes 
      within tissues. Phenotypic noise, defined here as trait variability among 
      isogenic cells of the same type and sharing a common environment, has therefore 
      received a lot of attention. Given the potential fitness advantage provided by 
      phenotypic noise in fluctuating environments, the possibility that it is directly 
      subjected to evolutionary selection is being considered. For selection to act, 
      phenotypic noise must differ between contemporary genotypes. Whether this is the 
      case or not remains, however, unclear because phenotypic noise has very rarely 
      been quantified in natural populations. RESULTS: Using automated image analysis, 
      we describe here the phenotypic diversity of S. cerevisiae morphology at 
      single-cell resolution. We profiled hundreds of quantitative traits in more than 
      1,000 cells of 37 natural strains, which represent various geographical and 
      ecological origins of the species. We observed abundant trait variation between 
      strains, with no correlation with their ecological origin or population history. 
      Phenotypic noise strongly depended on the strain background. Noise variation was 
      largely trait-specific (specific strains showing elevated noise for subset of 
      traits) but also global (a few strains displaying elevated noise for many 
      unrelated traits). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that phenotypic noise 
      does differ quantitatively between natural populations. This supports the 
      possibility that, if noise is adaptive, microevolution may tune it in the wild. 
      This tuning may happen on specific traits or by varying the degree of global 
      phenotypic buffering.

LID - 355
AB  - Suboptimal availability of water and nutrients is a primary limitation to plant 
      growth in terrestrial ecosystems. The acquisition of soil resources by plant 
      roots is therefore an important component of plant fitness and agricultural 
      productivity. Plant root systems comprise a set of phenes, or traits, that 
      interact. Phenes are the units of the plant phenotype, and phene states represent 
      the variation in form and function a particular phene may take. Root phenes can 
      be classified as affecting resource acquisition or utilization, influencing 
      acquisition through exploration or exploitation, and in being metabolically 
      influential or neutral. These classifications determine how one phene will 
      interact with another phene, whether through foraging mechanisms or metabolic 
      economics. Phenes that influence one another through foraging mechanisms are 
      likely to operate within a phene module, a group of interacting phenes, that may 
      be co-selected. Examples of root phene interactions discussed are: (1) root hair 
      length × root hair density, (2) lateral branching × root cortical aerenchyma 
      (RCA), (3) adventitious root number × adventitious root respiration and basal 
      root growth angle (BRGA), (4) nodal root number × RCA, and (5) BRGA × root hair 
      length and density. Progress in the study of phenes and phene interactions will 
      be facilitated by employing simulation modeling and near-isophenic lines that 
      allow the study of specific phenes and phene combinations within a common 
      phenotypic background. Developing a robust understanding of the phenome at the 
      organismal level will require new lines of inquiry into how phenotypic 
      integration influences plant function in diverse environments. A better 
      understanding of how root phenes interact to affect soil resource acquisition 
      will be an important tool in the breeding of crops with superior stress tolerance 
      and reduced dependence on intensive use of inputs.

AB  - The functional analysis of the rice genome has entered into a high-throughput 
      stage, and a project named RICE2020 has been proposed to determine the function 
      of every gene in the rice genome by the year 2020. However, as compared with the 
      robustness of genetic techniques, the evaluation of rice phenotypic traits is 
      still performed manually, and the process is subjective, inefficient, destructive 
      and error-prone. To overcome these limitations and help rice phenomics more 
      closely parallel rice genomics, reliable, automatic, multifunctional, and 
      high-throughput phenotyping platforms should be developed. In this article, we 
      discuss the key plant phenotyping technologies, particularly photonics-based 
      technologies, and then introduce their current applications in rice (wheat or 
      barley) phenomics. We also note the major challenges in rice phenomics and are 
      confident that these reliable high-throughput phenotyping tools will give plant 
      scientists new perspectives on the information encoded in the rice genome.

TI  - Towards building a disease-phenotype knowledge base: extracting 
      disease-manifestation relationship from literature.
PG  - 2186-94
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btt359 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Systems approaches to studying phenotypic relationships among 
      diseases are emerging as an active area of research for both novel disease gene 
      discovery and drug repurposing. Currently, systematic study of disease phenotypic 
      relationships on a phenome-wide scale is limited because large-scale 
      machine-understandable disease-phenotype relationship knowledge bases are often 
      unavailable. Here, we present an automatic approach to extract 
      disease-manifestation (D-M) pairs (one specific type of disease-phenotype 
      relationship) from the wide body of published biomedical literature. DATA AND 
      METHODS: Our method leverages external knowledge and limits the amount of human 
      effort required. For the text corpus, we used 119 085 682 MEDLINE sentences (21 
      354 075 citations). First, we used D-M pairs from existing biomedical ontologies 
      as prior knowledge to automatically discover D-M-specific syntactic patterns. We 
      then extracted additional pairs from MEDLINE using the learned patterns. Finally, 
      we analysed correlations between disease manifestations and disease-associated 
      genes and drugs to demonstrate the potential of this newly created knowledge base 
      in disease gene discovery and drug repurposing. RESULTS: In total, we extracted 
      121 359 unique D-M pairs with a high precision of 0.924. Among the extracted 
      pairs, 120 419 (99.2%) have not been captured in existing structured knowledge 
      sources. We have shown that disease manifestations correlate positively with both 
      disease-associated genes and drug treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The main contribution 
      of our study is the creation of a large-scale and accurate D-M phenotype 
      relationship knowledge base. This unique knowledge base, when combined with 
      existing phenotypic, genetic and proteomic datasets, can have profound 
      implications in our deeper understanding of disease etiology and in rapid drug 
      repurposing. AVAILABILITY: http://nlp.case.edu/public/data/DMPatternUMLS/

TI  - Visualizing genomic information across chromosomes with PhenoGram.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1186/1756-0381-6-18 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the abundance of information and analysis results being 
      collected for genetic loci, user-friendly and flexible data visualization 
      approaches can inform and improve the analysis and dissemination of these data. A 
      chromosomal ideogram is an idealized graphic representation of chromosomes. 
      Ideograms can be combined with overlaid points, lines, and/or shapes, to provide 
      summary information from studies of various kinds, such as genome-wide 
      association studies or phenome-wide association studies, coupled with genomic 
      location information. To facilitate visualizing varied data in multiple ways 
      using ideograms, we have developed a flexible software tool called PhenoGram 
      which exists as a web-based tool and also a command-line program. RESULTS: With 
      PhenoGram researchers can create chomosomal ideograms annotated with lines in 
      color at specific base-pair locations, or colored base-pair to base-pair regions, 
      with or without other annotation. PhenoGram allows for annotation of chromosomal 
      locations and/or regions with shapes in different colors, gene identifiers, or 
      other text. PhenoGram also allows for creation of plots showing expanded 
      chromosomal locations, providing a way to show results for specific chromosomal 
      regions in greater detail. We have now used PhenoGram to produce a variety of 
      different plots, and provide these as examples herein. These plots include 
      visualization of the genomic coverage of SNPs from a genotyping array, 
      highlighting the chromosomal coverage of imputed SNPs, copy-number variation 
      region coverage, as well as plots similar to the NHGRI GWA Catalog of genome-wide 
      association results. CONCLUSIONS: PhenoGram is a versatile, user-friendly 
      software tool fostering the exploration and sharing of genomic information. 
      Through visualization of data, researchers can both explore and share complex 
      results, facilitating a greater understanding of these data.

TI  - Evidence for a shared genetic susceptibility to migraine and epilepsy.
PG  - 288-95
LID - 10.1111/epi.12072 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Although epilepsy and migraine are known to co-occur within individuals, 
      the contribution of a shared genetic susceptibility to this comorbidity remains 
      unclear. We investigated the hypothesis of shared genetic effects on migraine and 
      epilepsy in the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP) cohort. METHODS: We 
      studied prevalence of a history of migraine in 730 EPGP participants aged ≥ 12 
      years with nonacquired focal epilepsy (NAFE) or generalized epilepsy (GE) from 
      501 families containing two or more individuals with epilepsy of unknown cause. 
      Information on migraine without aura (MO) and migraine with aura (MA) was 
      collected using an instrument validated for individuals ≥ 12 years. Because many 
      individuals have both MO and MA, we considered two nonoverlapping groups of 
      individuals with migraine: those who met criteria for MA in any of their 
      headaches (MA), and those who did not ("MO-only"). EPGP participants were 
      interviewed about the history of seizure disorders in additional nonenrolled 
      family members. We evaluated associations of migraine prevalence in enrolled 
      subjects with a family history of seizure disorders in additional nonenrolled 
      relatives, using generalized estimating equations to control for the 
      nonindependence of observations within families. KEY FINDINGS: Prevalence of a 
      history of MA (but not MO-only) was significantly increased in enrolled 
      participants with two or more additional affected first-degree relatives. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: These findings support the hypothesis of a shared genetic 
      susceptibility to epilepsy and MA.

TI  - Lennox-Gastaut syndrome of unknown cause: phenotypic characteristics of patients 
      in the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project.
PG  - 1898-904
LID - 10.1111/epi.12395 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a devastating childhood-onset epilepsy 
      syndrome. The cause is unknown in 25% of cases. Little has been described about 
      the specific clinical or electroencephalography (EEG) features of LGS of unknown 
      or genetic cause (LGS(u)). The Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP) aims to 
      characterize LGS(u) by phenotypic analysis of patients with LGS(u) and their 
      parents. METHODS: One hundred thirty-five patients with LGS with no known 
      etiology and their parents were enrolled from 19 EPGP centers in the United 
      States and Australia. Clinical data from medical records, standardized 
      questionnaires, imaging, and EEG were collected with use of online informatics 
      systems developed for EPGP. KEY FINDINGS: LGS(u) in the EPGP cohort had a broad 
      range of onset of epilepsy from 1 to 13 years, was male predominant (p < 0.0002), 
      and was associated with normal development prior to seizure onset in 59.2% of 
      patients. Despite the diagnosis, almost half of the adult patients with LGS(u) 
      completed secondary school. Parents were cognitively normal. All subjects had EEG 
      recordings with generalized epileptiform abnormalities with a spike wave 
      frequency range of 1-5 Hz (median 2 Hz), whereas 8.1% of subjects had EEG studies 
      with a normal posterior dominant rhythm. Almost 12% of patients evolved from West 
      syndrome. SIGNIFICANCE: LGS(u) has distinctive characteristics including a broad 
      age range of onset, male predominance, and often normal development prior to the 
      onset of seizures. Cognitive achievements such as completion of secondary school 
      were possible in half of adult patients. Our phenotypic description of LGS(u) 
      coupled with future genetic studies will advance our understanding of this 
      epilepsy syndrome.

TI  - An integrative genomic analysis of the superior fecundity phenotype in QSi5 mice.
PG  - 217-26
LID - 10.1007/s12033-012-9530-y [doi]
AB  - Laboratory inbred mouse models are a valuable resource to identify quantitative 
      trait loci (QTL) for complex reproductive performance traits. Advances in mouse 
      genomics and high density single nucleotide polymorphism mapping has enabled 
      genome-wide association studies to identify genes linked with specific 
      phenotypes. Gene expression profiles of reproductive tissues also provide 
      potentially useful information for identifying genes that play an important role. 
      We have developed a highly fecund inbred strain, QSi5, with accompanying 
      genotyping for comparative analysis of reproductive performance. Here we analyzed 
      the QSi5 phenotype using a comparative analysis with fecundity data derived from 
      22 inbred strains of mice from the Mouse Phenome Project, and integration with 
      published expression data from mouse ovary development. Using a haplotype 
      association approach, 400 fecundity-associated regions (FDR < 0.05) with 499 
      underlying genes were identified. The most significant associations were located 
      on Chromosomes 14, 8, and 6, and the genes underlying these regions were 
      extracted. When these genes were analyzed for expression in an ovarian 
      development profile (GSE6916) several distinctive co-expression patterns across 
      each developmental stage were identified. The genetic analysis also refined 21 
      fecundity associated intervals on Chromosomes 1, 6, 9, 13, and 17 that overlapped 
      with previously reported reproductive performance QTL. The combined use of 
      phenotypic and in silico data with an integrative genomic analysis provides a 
      powerful tool for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying fecundity.

      available through electronic health records (EHR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 24 580 
      adults from the multiparameter intelligent monitoring in intensive care V.6 
      (MIMIC II) EHR database of critically ill patients were analyzed, with 
      significant temporal associations visualized as a map of associations between 
      hospital length of stay (LOS) and ICD-9-CM codes. An expanded phenotype, using 
      ICD-9-CM, microbiology, and computerized physician order entry data, was defined 
      for hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile (HA-CDI). LOS, estimated costs, 
      30-day post-discharge mortality, and antecedent medication provider order entry 
      were evaluated for HA-CDI cases compared to randomly selected controls. RESULTS: 
      Temporal phenome analysis revealed 191 significant codes (p value, adjusted for 
      false discovery rate, ≤0.05). HA-CDI was identified in 414 cases, and was 
      associated with longer median LOS, 20 versus 9 days, and adjusted HR 0.33 (95% CI 
      0.28 to 0.39). This prolongation carries an estimated annual incremental cost 
      increase of US$1.2-2.0 billion in the USA alone. DISCUSSION: Comprehensive EHR 
      data have made large-scale phenome-based analysis feasible. Time-dependent 
      pathological disease states have dynamic phenomic evolution, which may be 
      captured through visual analytical approaches. Although MIMIC II is a single 
      institutional retrospective database, our approach should be portable to other 
      EHR data sources, including prospective 'learning healthcare systems'. For 
      example, interventions to prevent HA-CDI could be dynamically evaluated using the 
      same techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The new visual analytical method described in this 
      paper led directly to the identification of numerous hospital-acquired 
      conditions, which could be further explored through an expanded phenotype 
      definition.

TI  - External phenome analysis enables a rational federated query strategy to detect 
      changing rates of treatment-related complications associated with multiple 
      myeloma.
PG  - 696-9

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) are increasingly useful for health services 
      research. For relatively uncommon conditions, such as multiple myeloma (MM) and 
      its treatment-related complications, a combination of multiple EHR sources is 
      essential for such research. The Shared Health Research Information Network 
      (SHRINE) enables queries for aggregate results across participating institutions. 
      Development of a rational search strategy in SHRINE may be augmented through 
      analysis of pre-existing databases. We developed a SHRINE query for likely 
      non-infectious treatment-related complications of MM, based upon an analysis of 
      the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC II) database. 
      Using this query strategy, we found that the rate of likely treatment-related 
      complications significantly increased from 2001 to 2007, by an average of 6% a 
      year (p=0.01), across the participating SHRINE institutions. This finding is in 
      keeping with increasingly aggressive strategies in the treatment of MM. This 
      proof of concept demonstrates that a staged approach to federated queries, using 
      external EHR data, can yield potentially clinically meaningful results.

AB  - To better understand the quantitative characteristics and structure of phenotypic 
      diversity, we measured over 14,000 transcript, protein, metabolite, and 
      morphological traits in 22 genetically diverse strains of Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae. More than 50% of all measured traits varied significantly across 
      strains [false discovery rate (FDR) = 5%]. The structure of phenotypic 
      correlations is complex, with 85% of all traits significantly correlated with at 
      least one other phenotype (median = 6, maximum = 328). We show how 
      high-dimensional molecular phenomics data sets can be leveraged to accurately 
      predict phenotypic variation between strains, often with greater precision than 
      afforded by DNA sequence information alone. These results provide new insights 
      into the spectrum and structure of phenotypic diversity and the characteristics 
      influencing the ability to accurately predict phenotypes.

TI  - DNA marker applications to molecular genetics and genomics in tomato.
PG  - 21-30
LID - 10.1270/jsbbs.63.21 [doi]
AB  - Tomato is an important crop and regarded as an experimental model of the 
      Solanaceae family and of fruiting plants in general. To enhance breeding 
      efficiency and advance the field of genetics, tomato has been subjected to DNA 
      marker studies as one of the earliest targets in plants. The developed DNA 
      markers have been applied to the construction of genetic linkage maps and the 
      resultant maps have contributed to quantitative trait locus (QTL) and gene 
      mappings for agronomically important traits, as well as to comparative genomics 
      of Solanaceae. The recently released whole genome sequences of tomato enable us 
      to develop large numbers of DNA markers comparatively easily, and even promote 
      new genotyping methods without DNA markers. In addition, databases for genomes, 
      DNA markers, genetic linkage maps and other omics data, e.g., transcriptome, 
      proteome, metabolome and phenome information, will provide useful information for 
      molecular breeding in tomatoes. The use of DNA marker technologies in conjunction 
      with new breeding techniques will promise to advance tomato breeding.

TI  - A genome- and phenome-wide association study to identify genetic variants 
      influencing platelet count and volume and their pleiotropic effects.
PG  - 95-109
LID - 10.1007/s00439-013-1355-7 [doi]
AB  - Platelets are enucleated cell fragments derived from megakaryocytes that play key 
      roles in hemostasis and in the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis and cancer. 
      Platelet traits are highly heritable and identification of genetic variants 
      associated with platelet traits and assessing their pleiotropic effects may help 
      to understand the role of underlying biological pathways. We conducted an 
      electronic medical record (EMR)-based study to identify common variants that 
      influence inter-individual variation in the number of circulating platelets (PLT) 
      and mean platelet volume (MPV), by performing a genome-wide association study 
      (GWAS). We characterized genetic variants associated with MPV and PLT using 
      functional, pathway and disease enrichment analyses; we assessed pleiotropic 
      effects of such variants by performing a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) 
      with a wide range of EMR-derived phenotypes. A total of 13,582 participants in 
      the electronic MEdical Records and GEnomic network had data for PLT and 6,291 
      participants had data for MPV. We identified five chromosomal regions associated 
      with PLT and eight associated with MPV at genome-wide significance (P < 5E-8). In 
      addition, we replicated 20 SNPs [out of 56 SNPs (α: 0.05/56 = 9E-4)] influencing 
      PLT and 22 SNPs [out of 29 SNPs (α: 0.05/29 = 2E-3)] influencing MPV in a 
      published meta-analysis of GWAS of PLT and MPV. While our GWAS did not find any 
      new associations, our functional analyses revealed that genes in these regions 
      influence thrombopoiesis and encode kinases, membrane proteins, proteins involved 
      in cellular trafficking, transcription factors, proteasome complex subunits, 
      proteins of signal transduction pathways, proteins involved in megakaryocyte 
      development, and platelet production and hemostasis. PheWAS using a single-SNP 
      Bonferroni correction for 1,368 diagnoses (0.05/1368 = 3.6E-5) revealed that 
      several variants in these genes have pleiotropic associations with myocardial 
      infarction, autoimmune, and hematologic disorders. We conclude that multiple 
      genetic loci influence interindividual variation in platelet traits and also have 
      significant pleiotropic effects; the related genes are in multiple functional 
      pathways including those relevant to thrombopoiesis.

      the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project, a multicenter collaborative effort to 
      collect detailed phenotypic data on individuals with epilepsy. We reviewed 
      phenotypic data from participants with epilepsy and PMG. KEY FINDINGS: We 
      identified 87 participants, 43 female and 44 male, with PMG and epilepsy. Median 
      age of seizure onset was 3 years (range <1 month to 37 years). Most presented 
      with focal epilepsy (87.4%), some in combination with seizures generalized from 
      onset (23.0%). Focal seizures with dyscognitive features were most common 
      (54.3%). Of those presenting with generalized seizure types, infantile spasms 
      were most prevalent (45.2%). The most common topographic pattern was perisylvian 
      PMG (77.0%), of which the majority was bilateral (56.7%). Generalized PMG 
      presented with an earlier age of seizure onset (median age of 8 months) and an 
      increased prevalence of developmental delay prior to seizure onset (57.1%). Of 
      the unilateral, and asymmetric bilateral groups where PMG was more involved in 
      one hemisphere, the majority (71.4%) of participants had seizures that 
      lateralized to the same hemisphere as the PMG or the hemisphere with greater 
      involvement. SIGNIFICANCE: Participants with PMG had both focal and generalized 
      onset of seizures. Our data confirm the involvement of known topographic patterns 
      of PMG and suggest that more extensive distributions of PMG present with an 
      earlier age of seizure onset and increased prevalence of developmental delay 
      prior to seizure onset.

TI  - A phenomics approach to the analysis of the influence of glutathione on leaf area 
      and abiotic stress tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana.

AB  - Reduced glutathione (GSH) is an abundant low molecular weight plant thiol. It 
      fulfills multiple functions in plant biology, many of which remain poorly 
      characterized. A phenomics approach was therefore used to investigate the effects 
      of glutathione homeostasis on growth and stress tolerance in Arabidopsis 
      thaliana. Rosette leaf area was compared in mutants that are either defective in 
      GSH synthesis (cad2, pad2, and rax1) or the export of γ-glutamylcysteine and GSH 
      from the chloroplast (clt) and in wild-type plants under standard growth 
      conditions and following exposure to a range of abiotic stress treatments, 
      including oxidative stress, water stress, and high salt. In the absence of 
      stress, the GSH synthesis mutants had a significantly lower leaf area than the 
      wild type. Conversely, the clt mutant has a greater leaf area and a significantly 
      reduced lateral root density than the wild type. These findings demonstrate that 
      cellular glutathione homeostasis exerts an influence on root architecture and on 
      rosette area. An impaired capacity to synthesize GSH or a specific depletion of 
      the cytosolic GSH pool did not adversely affect leaf area in plants exposed to 
      short-term abiotic stress. However, the negative effects of long-term exposure to 
      oxidative stress and high salt on leaf area were less marked in the GSH synthesis 
      mutants than the wild type. These findings demonstrate the importance of cellular 
      glutathione homeostasis in the regulation of plant growth under optimal and 
      stress conditions.

TI  - Adaptive dynamics under development-based genotype-phenotype maps.
PG  - 361-4
LID - 10.1038/nature12142 [doi]
AB  - It is not known whether natural selection can encounter any given phenotype that 
      can be produced by genetic variation. There has been a long-lasting debate about 
      the processes that limit adaptation and, consequently, about how well adapted 
      phenotypes are. Here we examine how development may affect adaptation, by 
      decomposing the genotype-fitness map-the association between each genotype and 
      its fitness-into two: one mapping genotype to phenotype by means of a 
      computational model of organ development, and one mapping phenotype to fitness. 
      In the map of phenotype and fitness, the fitness of each individual is based on 
      the similarity between realized morphology and optimal morphology. We use three 
      different simulations to map phenotype to fitness, and these differ in the way in 
      which similarity is calculated: similarity is calculated for each trait (in terms 
      of each cell position individually), for a large or a small number of phenotypic 
      landmarks (the 'many-traits' and 'few-traits' phenotype-fitness maps), and by 
      measuring the overall surface roughness of morphology (the 'roughness' 
      phenotype-fitness map). Evolution is simulated by applying the genotype-phenotype 
      map and one phenotype-fitness map to each individual in the population, as well 
      as random mutation and drift. We show that the complexity of the 
      genotype-phenotype map prevents substantial adaptation in some of the 
      phenotype-fitness maps: sustained adaptation is only possible using 'roughness' 
      or 'few-traits' phenotype-fitness maps. The results contribute developmental 
      understanding to the long-standing question of which aspects of phenotype can be 
      effectively optimized by natural selection.

TI  - Genome- and phenome-wide analyses of cardiac conduction identifies markers of 
      arrhythmia risk.
PG  - 1377-85
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000604 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: ECG QRS duration, a measure of cardiac intraventricular conduction, 
      varies ≈2-fold in individuals without cardiac disease. Slow conduction may 
      promote re-entrant arrhythmias. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a genome-wide 
      association study to identify genomic markers of QRS duration in 5272 individuals 
      without cardiac disease selected from electronic medical record algorithms at 5 
      sites in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. The most 
      significant loci were evaluated within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research 
      in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium QRS genome-wide association study 
      meta-analysis. Twenty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 loci, previously 
      described by CHARGE, were replicated in the eMERGE samples; 18 single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms were in the chromosome 3 SCN5A and SCN10A loci, where the most 
      significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were rs1805126 in SCN5A with 
      P=1.2×10(-8) (eMERGE) and P=2.5×10(-20) (CHARGE) and rs6795970 in SCN10A with 
      P=6×10(-6) (eMERGE) and P=5×10(-27) (CHARGE). The other loci were in NFIA, near 
      CDKN1A, and near C6orf204. We then performed phenome-wide association studies on 
      variants in these 5 loci in 13859 European Americans to search for diagnoses 
      associated with these markers. Phenome-wide association study identified atrial 
      fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmias as the most common associated diagnoses with 
      SCN10A and SCN5A variants. SCN10A variants were also associated with subsequent 
      development of atrial fibrillation and arrhythmia in the original 5272 
      "heart-healthy" study population. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that DNA biobanks 
      coupled to electronic medical records not only provide a platform for genome-wide 
      association study but also may allow broad interrogation of the longitudinal 
      incidence of disease associated with genetic variants. The phenome-wide 
      association study approach implicated sodium channel variants modulating QRS 
      duration in subjects without cardiac disease as predictors of subsequent 
      arrhythmias.

TI  - A sustained depressive state promotes a guanfacine reversible susceptibility to 
      alcohol seeking in rats.
PG  - 1115-24
LID - 10.1038/npp.2013.311 [doi]
AB  - High rates of comorbidity between alcohol use disorder (AUD) and major depressive 
      disorder (MDD) are reported. Preclinical models examining effects of primary 
      depression on secondary AUD are currently absent, preventing adequate testing of 
      drug treatment. Here, we combined social defeat-induced persistent stress (SDPS) 
      and operant alcohol self-administration (SA) paradigms to assess causality 
      between these two neuropsychiatric disorders. We then exploited guanfacine, an 
      FDA-approved adrenergic agent reported to reduce drug craving in humans, against 
      SDPS-induced modulation of operant alcohol SA. Wistar rats were socially defeated 
      and isolated for a period of ≥9 weeks, during which depression-like 
      symptomatology (cognitive and social behavioral symptoms) was assessed. 
      Subsequently, animals were subjected to a 5-month operant alcohol SA paradigm, 
      examining acquisition, motivation, extinction, and cue-induced reinstatement of 
      alcohol seeking. The effects of guanfacine on motivation and relapse were 
      measured at >6 months following defeat. SDPS rats exhibited significant 
      disruption of social and cognitive behavior, including short-term spatial and 
      long-term social memory, several months following defeat. Notably, SDPS increased 
      motivation to obtain alcohol, and cue-induced relapse vulnerability. Guanfacine 
      reversed the SDPS-induced effects on motivation and relapse. Together, our model 
      mimics core symptomatology of a sustained depressive-like state and a subsequent 
      vulnerability to alcohol abuse. We show that SDPS is strongly associated with an 
      enhanced motivation for alcohol intake and relapse. Finally, we show that the 
      clinically employed drug guanfacine has potential as a novel treatment option in 
      comorbid patients, as it effectively reduced the enhanced sensitivity to alcohol 
      and alcohol-associated stimuli.

AB  - In recent years the study of root phenotypic plasticity in response to 
      sub-optimal environmental factors and the genetic control of these responses have 
      received renewed attention. As a path to increased productivity, in particular 
      for low fertility soils, several applied research projects worldwide target the 
      improvement of crop root traits both in plant breeding and biotechnology 
      contexts. To assist these tasks and address the challenge of optimizing root 
      growth and architecture for enhanced mineral resource use, the development of 
      realistic simulation models is of great importance. We review this research field 
      from a modeling perspective focusing particularly on nutrient acquisition 
      strategies for crop production on low nitrogen and low phosphorous soils. Soil 
      heterogeneity and the dynamics of nutrient availability in the soil pose a 
      challenging environment in which plants have to forage efficiently for nutrients 
      in order to maintain their internal nutrient homeostasis throughout their life 
      cycle. Mathematical models assist in understanding plant growth strategies and 
      associated root phenes that have potential to be tested and introduced in 
      physiological breeding programs. At the same time, we stress that it is necessary 
      to carefully consider model assumptions and development from a whole 
      plant-resource allocation perspective and to introduce or refine modules 
      simulating explicitly root growth and architecture dynamics through ontogeny with 
      reference to key factors that constrain root growth. In this view it is important 
      to understand negative feedbacks such as plant-plant competition. We conclude by 
      briefly touching on available and developing technologies for quantitative root 
      phenotyping from lab to field, from quantification of partial root profiles in 
      the field to 3D reconstruction of whole root systems. Finally, we discuss how 
      these approaches can and should be tightly linked to modeling to explore the root 
      phenome.

AB  - Using a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach, we comprehensively 
      tested genetic variants for association with phenotypes available for 70,061 
      study participants in the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology 
      (PAGE) network. Our aim was to better characterize the genetic architecture of 
      complex traits and identify novel pleiotropic relationships. This PheWAS drew on 
      five population-based studies representing four major racial/ethnic groups 
      (European Americans (EA), African Americans (AA), Hispanics/Mexican-Americans, 
      and Asian/Pacific Islanders) in PAGE, each site with measurements for multiple 
      traits, associated laboratory measures, and intermediate biomarkers. A total of 
      83 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by genome-wide association 
      studies (GWAS) were genotyped across two or more PAGE study sites. Comprehensive 
      tests of association, stratified by race/ethnicity, were performed, encompassing 
      4,706 phenotypes mapped to 105 phenotype-classes, and association results were 
      compared across study sites. A total of 111 PheWAS results had significant 
      associations for two or more PAGE study sites with consistent direction of effect 
      with a significance threshold of p<0.01 for the same racial/ethnic group, SNP, 
      and phenotype-class. Among results identified for SNPs previously associated with 
      phenotypes such as lipid traits, type 2 diabetes, and body mass index, 52 
      replicated previously published genotype-phenotype associations, 26 represented 
      phenotypes closely related to previously known genotype-phenotype associations, 
      and 33 represented potentially novel genotype-phenotype associations with 
      pleiotropic effects. The majority of the potentially novel results were for 
      single PheWAS phenotype-classes, for example, for CDKN2A/B rs1333049 (previously 
      associated with type 2 diabetes in EA) a PheWAS association was identified for 
      hemoglobin levels in AA. Of note, however, GALNT2 rs2144300 (previously 
      associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in EA) had multiple 
      potentially novel PheWAS associations, with hypertension related phenotypes in AA 
      and with serum calcium levels and coronary artery disease phenotypes in EA. 
      PheWAS identifies associations for hypothesis generation and exploration of the 
      genetic architecture of complex traits.

      aneuploidy contributes to human diseases.
PG  - 193-205
LID - 10.1159/000348303 [doi]
AB  - Whereas germline-inherited whole-chromosome aneuploidy has long been known to 
      cause miscarriages and developmental abnormalities, somatically acquired 
      aneuploidies have been observed in cancer cells and more recently also in cells 
      of the normal liver and brain. Furthermore, aneuploidy is being increasingly 
      reported in clinical isolates of pathogenic microbes such as fungi and parasites. 
      Whereas many efforts have been devoted to the dissection of the molecular 
      mechanisms that lead to aneuploidy, we have only recently started to investigate 
      how aneuploidy alters the phenotypic makeup of a cell. Here we review recent 
      evidence supporting the idea that aneuploidy is a large-effect mutation that 
      introduces large changes in the cellular phenome. From a systems biology 
      perspective, this can be explained by the extensive changes that aneuploidy 
      brings about in both the transcriptome and the proteome of a cell. We further 
      provide an evolutionary perspective on how aneuploidy-induced phenotypic 
      variation may contribute to the exacerbation of human pathologies such as cancer 
      and infectious diseases, by conferring selectable traits such as increased 
      virulence and drug resistance.

TI  - The Vertebrate Trait Ontology: a controlled vocabulary for the annotation of 
      trait data across species.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/2041-1480-4-13 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of ontologies to standardize biological data and facilitate 
      comparisons among datasets has steadily grown as the complexity and amount of 
      available data have increased. Despite the numerous ontologies available, one 
      area currently lacking a robust ontology is the description of vertebrate traits. 
      A trait is defined as any measurable or observable characteristic pertaining to 
      an organism or any of its substructures. While there are several ontologies to 
      describe entities and processes in phenotypes, diseases, and clinical 
      measurements, one has not been developed for vertebrate traits; the Vertebrate 
      Trait Ontology (VT) was created to fill this void. DESCRIPTION: Significant 
      inconsistencies in trait nomenclature exist in the literature, and additional 
      difficulties arise when trait data are compared across species. The VT is a 
      unified trait vocabulary created to aid in the transfer of data within and 
      between species and to facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of traits. 
      Trait information provides a valuable link between the measurements that are used 
      to assess the trait, the phenotypes related to the traits, and the diseases 
      associated with one or more phenotypes. Because multiple clinical and 
      morphological measurements are often used to assess a single trait, and a single 
      measurement can be used to assess multiple physiological processes, providing 
      investigators with standardized annotations for trait data will allow them to 
      investigate connections among these data types. CONCLUSIONS: The annotation of 
      genomic data with ontology terms provides unique opportunities for data mining 
      and analysis. Links between data in disparate databases can be identified and 
      explored, a strategy that is particularly useful for cross-species comparisons or 
      in situations involving inconsistent terminology. The VT provides a common basis 
      for the description of traits in multiple vertebrate species. It is being used in 
      the Rat Genome Database and Animal QTL Database for annotation of QTL data for 
      rat, cattle, chicken, swine, sheep, and rainbow trout, and in the Mouse Phenome 
      Database to annotate strain characterization data. In these databases, data are 
      also cross-referenced to applicable terms from other ontologies, providing 
      additional avenues for data mining and analysis. The ontology is available at 
      http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/50138.

AB  - The genotype-phenotype relation is at the core of theoretical biology. It is 
      argued why a mathematically based explanatory structure of this relation is in 
      principle possible, and why it has to embrace both sequence to consequence and 
      consequence to sequence phenomena. It is suggested that the primary role of DNA 
      in the chain of causality is that its presence allows a living system to induce 
      perturbations of its own dynamics as a function of its own system state or 
      phenome, i.e. it capacitates living systems to self-transcend beyond those 
      morphogenetic limits that exist for non-living open physical systems in general. 
      Dynamic models bridging genotypes with phenotypic variation in a causally 
      cohesive way are shown to provide explanations of genetic phenomena that go well 
      beyond the explanatory domains of statistically oriented genetics theory 
      construction. A theory originally proposed by Rupert Riedl, which implies that 
      the morphospace that is reachable by the standing genetic variation in a 
      population is quite restricted due to systemic constraints, is shown to provide a 
      foundation for a mathematical conceptualization of numerous evolutionary 
      phenomena associated with the phenotypic consequence to sequence relation. The 
      paper may be considered a call to arms to mathematicians and the mathematically 
      inclined to rise to the challenge of developing new formalisms capable of dealing 
      with the deep defining characteristics of living systems.

TI  - Phenotypic approaches to drought in cassava: review.
PG  - 93
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2013.00093 [doi]
LID - 93
AB  - Cassava is an important crop in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. 
      Cassava can be produced adequately in drought conditions making it the ideal food 
      security crop in marginal environments. Although cassava can tolerate drought 
      stress, it can be genetically improved to enhance productivity in such 
      environments. Drought adaptation studies in over three decades in cassava have 
      identified relevant mechanisms which have been explored in conventional breeding. 
      Drought is a quantitative trait and its multigenic nature makes it very 
      challenging to effectively manipulate and combine genes in breeding for rapid 
      genetic gain and selection process. Cassava has a long growth cycle of 12-18 
      months which invariably contributes to a long breeding scheme for the crop. 
      Modern breeding using advances in genomics and improved genotyping, is 
      facilitating the dissection and genetic analysis of complex traits including 
      drought tolerance, thus helping to better elucidate and understand the genetic 
      basis of such traits. A beneficial goal of new innovative breeding strategies is 
      to shorten the breeding cycle using minimized, efficient or fast phenotyping 
      protocols. While high throughput genotyping have been achieved, this is rarely 
      the case for phenotyping for drought adaptation. Some of the storage root 
      phenotyping in cassava are often done very late in the evaluation cycle making 
      selection process very slow. This paper highlights some modified traits suitable 
      for early-growth phase phenotyping that may be used to reduce drought phenotyping 
      cycle in cassava. Such modified traits can significantly complement the high 
      throughput genotyping procedures to fast track breeding of improved drought 
      tolerant varieties. The need for metabolite profiling, improved phenomics to take 
      advantage of next generation sequencing technologies and high throughput 
      phenotyping are basic steps for future direction to improve genetic gain and 
      maximize speed for drought tolerance breeding.

      Project.
PG  - 661-6
LID - 10.1002/humu.22293 [doi]
AB  - A forum of the Human Variome Project (HVP) was held as a satellite to the 2012 
      Annual Meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics in San Francisco, 
      California. The theme of this meeting was "Getting Ready for the Human Phenome 
      Project." Understanding the genetic contribution to both rare single-gene 
      "Mendelian" disorders and more complex common diseases will require integration 
      of research efforts among many fields and better defined phenotypes. The HVP is 
      dedicated to bringing together researchers and research populations throughout 
      the world to provide the resources to investigate the impact of genetic variation 
      on disease. To this end, there needs to be a greater sharing of phenotype and 
      genotype data. For this to occur, many databases that currently exist will need 
      to become interoperable to allow for the combining of cohorts with similar 
      phenotypes to increase statistical power for studies attempting to identify novel 
      disease genes or causative genetic variants. Improved systems and tools that 
      enhance the collection of phenotype data from clinicians are urgently needed. 
      This meeting begins the HVP's effort toward this important goal.

LID - 10.1126/science.1229237 [doi]
AB  - To discover interordinal relationships of living and fossil placental mammals and 
      the time of origin of placentals relative to the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) 
      boundary, we scored 4541 phenomic characters de novo for 86 fossil and living 
      species. Combining these data with molecular sequences, we obtained a 
      phylogenetic tree that, when calibrated with fossils, shows that crown clade 
      Placentalia and placental orders originated after the K-Pg boundary. Many nodes 
      discovered using molecular data are upheld, but phenomic signals overturn 
      molecular signals to show Sundatheria (Dermoptera + Scandentia) as the sister 
      taxon of Primates, a close link between Proboscidea (elephants) and Sirenia (sea 
      cows), and the monophyly of echolocating Chiroptera (bats). Our tree suggests 
      that Placentalia first split into Xenarthra and Epitheria; extinct New World 
      species are the oldest members of Afrotheria.

TI  - Stress, adaptation, and speciation in the evolution of the blind mole rat,

AB  - Environmental stress played a major role in the evolution of the blind mole rat 
      superspecies Spalax ehrenbergi, affecting its adaptive evolution and ecological 
      speciation underground. Spalax is safeguarded all of its life underground from 
      aboveground climatic fluctuations and predators. However, it encounters multiple 
      stresses in its underground burrows including darkness, energetics, hypoxia, 
      hypercapnia, food scarcity, and pathogenicity. Consequently, it evolved adaptive 
      genomic, proteomic, and phenomic complexes to cope with those stresses. Here I 
      describe some of these adaptive complexes, and their theoretical and applied 
      perspectives. Spalax mosaic molecular and organismal evolution involves 
      reductions or regressions coupled with expansions or progressions caused by 
      evolutionary tinkering and natural genetic engineering. Speciation of Spalax in 
      Israel occurred in the Pleistocene, during the last 2.00-2.35 Mya, generating 
      four species associated intimately with four climatic regimes with increasing 
      aridity stress southwards and eastwards representing an ecological speciational 
      adaptive trend: (Spalax golani, 2n=54→S. galili, 2n=52→S. carmeli, 2n=58→S. 
      judaei, 2n=60). Darwinian ecological speciation occurred gradually with 
      relatively little genetic change by Robertsonian chromosomal and genic mutations. 
      Spalax genome sequencing has just been completed. It involves multiple adaptive 
      complexes to life underground and is an evolutionary model to a few hundred 
      underground mammals. It involves great promise in the future for medicine, space 
      flight, and deep-sea diving.

TI  - Phenome-wide association studies on a quantitative trait: application to TPMT 
      enzyme activity and thiopurine therapy in pharmacogenomics.

AB  - Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) investigate whether genetic 
      polymorphisms associated with a phenotype are also associated with other 
      diagnoses. In this study, we have developed new methods to perform a PheWAS based 
      on ICD-10 codes and biological test results, and to use a quantitative trait as 
      the selection criterion. We tested our approach on thiopurine S-methyltransferase 
      (TPMT) activity in patients treated by thiopurine drugs. We developed 2 
      aggregation methods for the ICD-10 codes: an ICD-10 hierarchy and a mapping to 
      existing ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes. Eleven biological test results were also 
      analyzed using discretization algorithms. We applied these methods in patients 
      having a TPMT activity assessment from the clinical data warehouse of a French 
      academic hospital between January 2000 and July 2013. Data after initiation of 
      thiopurine treatment were analyzed and patient groups were compared according to 
      their TPMT activity level. A total of 442 patient records were analyzed 
      representing 10,252 ICD-10 codes and 72,711 biological test results. The results 
      from the ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes and ICD-10 hierarchy codes were concordant. 
      Cross-validation with the biological test results allowed us to validate the ICD 
      phenotypes. Iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes mellitus were associated with a 
      very high TPMT activity (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0015, respectively). We describe 
      here an original method to perform PheWAS on a quantitative trait using both 
      ICD-10 diagnosis codes and biological test results to identify associated 
      phenotypes. In the field of pharmacogenomics, PheWAS allow for the identification 
      of new subgroups of patients who require personalized clinical and therapeutic 
      management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP) is a large-scale, 
      multi-institutional, collaborative network of 27 epilepsy centers throughout the 
      U.S., Australia, and Argentina, with the objective of collecting detailed 
      phenotypic and genetic data on a large number of epilepsy participants. The goals 
      of EPGP are (1) to perform detailed phenotyping on 3750 participants with 
      specific forms of non-acquired epilepsy and 1500 parents without epilepsy, (2) to 
      obtain DNA samples on these individuals, and (3) to ultimately genotype the 
      samples in order to discover novel genes that cause epilepsy. To carry out the 
      project, a reliable and robust informatics platform was needed for standardized 
      electronic data collection and storage, data quality review, and phenotypic 
      analysis involving cases from multiple sites. METHODS: EPGP developed its own 
      suite of web-based informatics applications for participant tracking, electronic 
      data collection (using electronic case report forms/surveys), data management, 
      phenotypic data review and validation, specimen tracking, electroencephalograph 
      and neuroimaging storage, and issue tracking. We implemented procedures to train 
      and support end-users at each clinical site. RESULTS: Thus far, 3780 study 
      participants have been enrolled and 20,957 web-based study activities have been 
      completed using this informatics platform. Over 95% of respondents to an end-user 
      satisfaction survey felt that the informatics platform was successful almost 
      always or most of the time. CONCLUSIONS: The EPGP informatics platform has 
      successfully and effectively allowed study management and efficient and reliable 
      collection of phenotypic data. Our novel informatics platform met the 
      requirements of a large, multicenter research project. The platform has had a 
      high level of end-user acceptance by principal investigators and study 
      coordinators, and can serve as a model for new tools to support future large 
      scale, collaborative research projects collecting extensive phenotypic data.

AB  - The world is rapidly changing, and is exhibiting increased variability in 
      environmental conditions. One of the grand challenges of current biology is to 
      understand how, and predict which species will be able to cope with uncertain 
      environments. The goal of this symposium was to explore how integrating 
      physiological mechanisms with behavior and evolutionary ecology can help us 
      understand how organisms cope with uncertainty. Here, we briefly review core 
      principles that emerged in the symposium and topics covered by the presenters. 
      Ecological studies can benefit from considering physiological mechanisms as these 
      mechanisms may indicate constraints and trade-offs. In addition, considering the 
      entire phenotype in an integrated way (the phenome) may reveal how different 
      traits may trade-off or affect each other. Finally, considering the range of 
      phenotypic plasticity is critical in exploring how organisms may cope with 
      uncertainty via plasticity and/or adaptive evolution.

      from genomic data mining, functional enrichment, pathway analysis and phenomics.

AB  - Biotic and abiotic stresses adversely affect agriculture by reducing crop growth 
      and productivity worldwide. To investigate the abiotic stress-responsive genes in 
      Arabidopsis thaliana, we compiled a dataset of stress signals and differentially 
      upregulated genes (>= 2.5 fold change) from Stress-responsive transcription 
      Factors DataBase (STIFDB) with additional set of stress signals and genes curated 
      from PubMed and Gene Expression Omnibus. A dataset of 3091 genes differentially 
      upregulated due to 14 different stress signals (abscisic acid, aluminum, cold, 
      cold-drought-salt, dehydration, drought, heat, iron, light, NaCl, osmotic stress, 
      oxidative stress, UV-B and wounding) were curated and used for the analysis. 
      Details about stress-responsive enriched genes and their association with stress 
      signals can be obtained from STIFDB2 database . The gene-stress-signal data were 
      analyzed using an enrichment-based meta-analysis framework consisting of two 
      different ontologies (Gene Ontology and Plant Ontology), biological pathway and 
      functional domain annotations. We found several shared and distinct biological 
      processes, cellular components and molecular functions associated with 
      stress-responsive genes. Pathway analysis revealed that stress-responsive genes 
      perturbed the pathways under the "Metabolic pathways" category. We also found 
      several shared and stress-signal specific protein domains, suggesting functional 
      mechanisms regulating stress-response. Phenomic characteristics of abiotic 
      stress-responsive genes were ascertained for several stresses and found to be 
      shared by multiple stresses in both anatomy and temporal categories of Plant 
      Ontology. We found several constitutive stress-responsive genes that are 
      differentially upregulated due to perturbation of different stress signals, for 
      example a gene (AT1G68440) involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism and polyamine 
      catabolism as responsive to seven different stress signals. We also performed 
      structure-function prediction of five genes associated responsive to multiple 
      abiotic stress signals. We envisage that results from our analysis that provide 
      insight into functional repertoire, metabolic pathways and phenomic 
      characteristics common and specifically associated with stress signals would help 
      to understand abiotic stress regulome in Arabidopsis thaliana and may also help 
      to develop an improved plant variety using molecular breeding and genetic 
      engineering techniques that are rapidly stress-responsive and tolerant.

TI  - Diagnostic Prediction of Von Willebrand Disease using Multiple Bleeding Phenomics 
      Datasets.
PG  - 184
AB  - The rigorous assessment of bleeding symptoms is a key component in establishing a 
      diagnosis in patients suspected of having von Willebrand disease (VWD) and other 
      inherited bleeding disorders. Multiple bleeding questionnaires have been 
      developed and validated to capture bleeding history phenotypes for assessing 
      patients with bleeding disorders. In this study we developed a prediction model 
      based on Naïve Bayes decision tree classifier by analyzing various phenotypic 
      attributes derived from multiple bleeding questionnaires. We evaluated the 
      classification effectiveness derived from the top 25 attributes with highest 
      discriminations on prediction of VWD. We used data from 952 patients and the 
      classifier achieved a precision of 95%, recall of 94%, and a Receiving Operating 
      Curve (ROC) area under the curve of 0.97.

AB  - With the advent of transgenic technology, it has become possible to mobilize and 
      express foreign genes into plants and to design crop varieties with better 
      agronomic attributes and adaptability to challenging environmental conditions. 
      Recent advances in transgenic technology have led to concerns about safety of 
      transgenic crops to human and animal health and environment. Biosafety focuses on 
      preventing, minimizing and eliminating risks associated with the research, 
      production, and use of transgenic crops. Food biosafety involves studies of 
      substantial equivalence related to compositional analysis, toxicity and 
      allergenicity. Environmental biosafety involves glasshouse and field trials and 
      study of unintended effects on non-target organisms. Transgenics are 
      characterized at phenotypic and molecular levels for understanding the location 
      of transgene insertion site, ploidy level, copy number, integrated vector 
      sequences, protein expression and stability of the transgene. Various techniques 
      employed for transgene characterization include flow cytometry, southern, 
      northern and western analyses, real-time (qRT) PCR, competitive PCR, FISH, 
      fiber-FISH, DNA micro-arrays, mRNA profiling, 2DE-MS, iTRAQ, FT-MS, NMR, GC-MS, 
      CE-MS and biosensor-based approaches. Evaluation of transgene expression involves 
      the application of integrated phenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and 
      metabolomics approaches. However, the relevance and application of these 
      approaches may vary in different cases. The elaborate analysis of transgenic 
      crops will facilitate the safety assessment and commercialization of transgenics 
      and lead to global food security for the future.

TI  - Evidence of metabolic switching and implications for food safety from the 
      phenome(s) of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 cultured at selected 
      points across the pork production food chain.
PG  - 5437-49
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01041-13 [doi]
AB  - Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 is a recognized food-borne pathogen 
      that displays a multidrug-resistant phenotype and that is associated with 
      systemic infections. At one extreme of the food chain, this bacterium can infect 
      humans, limiting the treatment options available and thereby contributing to 
      increased morbidity and mortality. Although the antibiotic resistance profile is 
      well defined, little is known about other phenotypes that may be expressed by 
      this pathogen at key points across the pork production food chain. In this study, 
      172 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104/DT104b isolated from an 
      extensive "farm-to-fork" surveillance study, focusing on the pork food chain, 
      were characterized in detail. Isolates were cultured from environmental, 
      processing, retail, and clinical sources, and the study focused on phenotypes 
      that may have contributed to persistence/survival in these different niches. 
      Molecular subtypes, along with antibiotic resistance profiles, tolerance to 
      biocides, motility, and biofilm formation, were determined. As a basis for human 
      infection, acid survival and the ability to utilize a range of energy sources and 
      to adhere to and/or invade Caco-2 cells were also studied. Comparative 
      alterations to biocide tolerance were observed in isolates from retail. 
      l-Tartaric acid and d-mannose-1-phosphate induced the formation of biofilms in a 
      preselected subset of strains, independent of their origin. All clinical isolates 
      were motile and demonstrated an enhanced ability to survive in acidic conditions. 
      Our data report on a diverse phenotype, expressed by S. Typhimurium isolates 
      cultured from the pork production food chain. Extending our understanding of the 
      means by which this pathogen adapts to environmental niches along the 
      "farm-to-fork" continuum will facilitate the protection of vulnerable consumers 
      through targeted improvements in food safety measures.

AB  - The environment's contribution to health has been conceptualized as the exposome. 
      Biomedical research interest in environmental exposures as a determinant of 
      physiopathological processes is rising as such data increasingly become 
      available. The panoply of miniaturized sensing devices now accessible and 
      affordable for individuals to use to monitor a widening range of parameters opens 
      up a new world of research data. Biomedical informatics (BMI) must provide a 
      coherent framework for dealing with multi-scale population data including the 
      phenome, the genome, the exposome, and their interconnections. The combination of 
      these more continuous, comprehensive, and personalized data sources requires new 
      research and development approaches to data management, analysis, and 
      visualization. This article analyzes the implications of a new paradigm for the 
      discipline of BMI, one that recognizes genome, phenome, and exposome data and 
      their intricate interactions as the basis for biomedical research now and for 
      clinical care in the near future.

AB  - Poplar (Populus) species are seen as candidates for removing heavy metal 
      contamination from polluted soil. A bottom-up multidisciplinary approach was 
      utilized to compare the performances of clones 58-861 and Poli (Populus nigra) 
      and A4A, a Populus nigra × Populus deltoides hybrid to Cd toxicity. Qualitative 
      and quantitative differences in their tolerance to Cd exposure and the uptake, 
      accumulation and translocation of Cd were noted following the hydroponic exposure 
      of rooted cuttings to 20 μM CdSO₄ for either 48 h or 14 d. Cadmium was less toxic 
      for the hybrid clone A4A as compared to Poli and 58-861. Cd uptake and root to 
      shoot translocation were determined by AAS, and its compartmentation was analyzed 
      using SEM/EDX. A comparative proteomic approach was utilized to identify changes 
      in proteins expression according to dose and time of exposure. Toxicity to Cd 
      mainly influenced proteins related to general defense, stress response and 
      carbohydrate metabolism.

TI  - LeafJ: an ImageJ plugin for semi-automated leaf shape measurement.
LID - 50028 [pii]
LID - 10.3791/50028 [doi]
AB  - High throughput phenotyping (phenomics) is a powerful tool for linking genes to 
      their functions (see review and recent examples). Leaves are the primary 
      photosynthetic organ, and their size and shape vary developmentally and 
      environmentally within a plant. For these reasons studies on leaf morphology 
      require measurement of multiple parameters from numerous leaves, which is best 
      done by semi-automated phenomics tools. Canopy shade is an important 
      environmental cue that affects plant architecture and life history; the suite of 
      responses is collectively called the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). Among SAS 
      responses, shade induced leaf petiole elongation and changes in blade area are 
      particularly useful as indices. To date, leaf shape programs (e.g. SHAPE, LAMINA, 
      LeafAnalyzer, LEAFPROCESSOR) can measure leaf outlines and categorize leaf 
      shapes, but can not output petiole length. Lack of large-scale measurement 
      systems of leaf petioles has inhibited phenomics approaches to SAS research. In 
      this paper, we describe a newly developed ImageJ plugin, called LeafJ, which can 
      rapidly measure petiole length and leaf blade parameters of the model plant 
      Arabidopsis thaliana. For the occasional leaf that required manual correction of 
      the petiole/leaf blade boundary we used a touch-screen tablet. Further, leaf cell 
      shape and leaf cell numbers are important determinants of leaf size. Separate 
      from LeafJ we also present a protocol for using a touch-screen tablet for 
      measuring cell shape, area, and size. Our leaf trait measurement system is not 
      limited to shade-avoidance research and will accelerate leaf phenotyping of many 
      mutants and screening plants by leaf phenotyping.

      profiles.

LID - 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2013.03.021 [doi]
AB  - The present study investigates individual differences in subjective sleepiness 
      profiles during 36 h of sustained wakefulness in a modified constant routine 
      protocol. Twenty-three volunteers (11 females), aged between 18 and 47 yrs (M age 
      = 30.41, SD = 10.26) enrolled in the study. Subjective sleepiness ratings were 
      collected every 2 h by means of visual analogue scales. Circadian rhythmicity was 
      assessed by means of salivary cortisol. Subjective sleepiness data were analyzed 
      using functional principal component analysis (fPCA). Our results show that 
      approximately 80% of the variance is accounted for by three functional 
      components. The first component explains 50.28% of the variance and is 
      characterized by a profile of exclusively positive loadings, representing 
      vertical shifts from the mean sleepiness profile. Scores on this component are 
      positively related to self-reported habitual sleep times and mean slow wave 
      activity (SWA) during wake. Positive scores on the second component (18.40% of 
      the variance) are characterized by a higher than average peak-to-trough amplitude 
      in subjective sleepiness profiles. Participants with higher than average scores 
      on this component show a significantly higher amplitude in salivary cortisol 
      profiles as opposed to participants with lower than average scores. Participants 
      with positive scores on the third component (10.09% of the variance) show higher 
      than average levels of subjective sleepiness during morning hours, a buildup of 
      wake effort occurring later and more afternoon sleepiness after sleep deprivation 
      than negative scorers. Peak levels of salivary cortisol occur significantly later 
      in these participants. Taken together, our results suggest that component 1 
      represents tonic differences in sleepiness profiles primarily related to 
      mechanisms of sleep homeostasis, component 2 to circadian amplitude differences 
      and component 3 to diurnal preference. However, since the components are 
      additions to a mean profile, each of the three components is likely to correspond 
      to a mixture of multiple physiological parameters, rather than to a single 
      process. The approach shows interesting potential for (1) revealing unidentified 
      physiological processes, (2) testing existing assumptions about regulatory 
      mechanisms at the basis of interindividual variability in sleepiness profiles and 
      (3) the specification of sleepiness phenotypes on a quantitative basis.

AB  - This work describes a new three-dimensional model for the integration and 
      visualization of comprehensive individual health-related information. The model 
      could be used to represent longitudinal datasets corresponding to any kind of 
      biomedical data (genome, phenome, exposome) relative to a single individual or to 
      populations. Analogously with geographical information systems this model 
      includes different layers at each time point, which are associated with different 
      sets of biomedical data. Each data element represented in this model receives two 
      angular and one linear (temporal) coordinates. This new model could be able to 
      represent virtually any kind of biomedical data including those captured in 
      real-time such as self-monitoring activities or other exposome-related 
      information.

TI  - How important are transposons for plant evolution?
PG  - 49-61
LID - 10.1038/nrg3374 [doi]
AB  - For decades, transposable elements have been known to produce a wide variety of 
      changes in plant gene expression and function. This has led to the idea that 
      transposable element activity has played a key part in adaptive plant evolution. 
      This Review describes the kinds of changes that transposable elements can cause, 
      discusses evidence that those changes have contributed to plant evolution and 
      suggests future strategies for determining the extent to which these changes have 
      in fact contributed to plant adaptation and evolution. Recent advances in 
      genomics and phenomics for a range of plant species, particularly crops, have 
      begun to allow the systematic assessment of these questions.

TI  - Associations of autoantibodies, autoimmune risk alleles, and clinical diagnoses 
      from the electronic medical records in rheumatoid arthritis cases and 
      non-rheumatoid arthritis controls.
PG  - 571-81
LID - 10.1002/art.37801 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The significance of non-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) autoantibodies in 
      patients with RA is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess associations of 
      autoantibodies with autoimmune risk alleles and with clinical diagnoses from the 
      electronic medical records (EMRs) among RA cases and non-RA controls. METHODS: 
      Data on 1,290 RA cases and 1,236 non-RA controls of European genetic ancestry 
      were obtained from the EMRs of 2 large academic centers. The levels of 
      anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), 
      anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (AGTAs), and anti-thyroid peroxidase 
      (anti-TPO) antibodies were measured. All subjects were genotyped for autoimmune 
      risk alleles, and the association between number of autoimmune risk alleles 
      present and number of types of autoantibodies present was studied. A phenome-wide 
      association study (PheWAS) was conducted to study potential associations between 
      autoantibodies and clinical diagnoses among RA cases and non-RA controls. 
      RESULTS: The mean ages were 60.7 years in RA cases and 64.6 years in non-RA 
      controls. The proportion of female subjects was 79% in each group. The prevalence 
      of ACPAs and ANAs was higher in RA cases compared to controls (each P < 0.0001); 
      there were no differences in the prevalence of anti-TPO antibodies and AGTAs. 
      Carriage of higher numbers of autoimmune risk alleles was associated with 
      increasing numbers of autoantibody types in RA cases (P = 2.1 × 10(-5)) and 
      non-RA controls (P = 5.0 × 10(-3)). From the PheWAS, the presence of ANAs was 
      significantly associated with a diagnosis of Sjögren's/sicca syndrome in RA 
      cases. CONCLUSION: The increased frequency of autoantibodies in RA cases and 
      non-RA controls was associated with the number of autoimmune risk alleles carried 
      by an individual. PheWAS of EMR data, with linkage to laboratory data obtained 
      from blood samples, provide a novel method to test for the clinical significance 
      of biomarkers in disease.

AB  - Animal biometrics is an emerging field that develops quantified approaches for 
      representing and detecting the phenotypic appearance of species, individuals, 
      behaviors, and morphological traits. It operates at the intersection between 
      pattern recognition, ecology, and information sciences, producing computerized 
      systems for phenotypic measurement and interpretation. Animal biometrics can 
      benefit a wide range of disciplines, including biogeography, population ecology, 
      and behavioral research. Currently, real-world applications are gaining momentum, 
      augmenting the quantity and quality of ecological data collection and processing. 
      However, to advance animal biometrics will require integration of methodologies 
      among the scientific disciplines involved. Such efforts will be worthwhile 
      because the great potential of this approach rests with the formal abstraction of 
      phenomics, to create tractable interfaces between different organizational levels 
      of life.

AB  - Murine models with modified gene function as a result of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea 
      (ENU) mutagenesis have been used to study phenotypes resulting from genetic 
      change. This study investigated genetic factors associated with red blood cell 
      (RBC) physiology and structural integrity that may impact on blood component 
      storage and transfusion outcome. Forward and reverse genetic approaches were 
      employed with pedigrees of ENU-treated mice using a homozygous recessive breeding 
      strategy. In a "forward genetic" approach, pedigree selection was based upon 
      identification of an altered phenotype followed by exome sequencing to identify a 
      causative mutation. In a second strategy, a "reverse genetic" approach based on 
      selection of pedigrees with mutations in genes of interest was utilised and, 
      following breeding to homozygosity, phenotype assessed. Thirty-three pedigrees 
      were screened by the forward genetic approach. One pedigree demonstrated 
      reticulocytosis, microcytic anaemia and thrombocytosis. Exome sequencing revealed 
      a novel single nucleotide variation (SNV) in Ank1 encoding the RBC structural 
      protein ankyrin-1 and the pedigree was designated Ank1(EX34). The reticulocytosis 
      and microcytic anaemia observed in the Ank1(EX34) pedigree were similar to 
      clinical features of hereditary spherocytosis in humans. For the reverse genetic 
      approach three pedigrees with different point mutations in Spnb1 encoding RBC 
      protein spectrin-1β, and one pedigree with a mutation in Epb4.1, encoding band 
      4.1 were selected for study. When bred to homozygosity two of the spectrin-1β 
      pedigrees (a, b) demonstrated increased RBC count, haemoglobin (Hb) and 
      haematocrit (HCT). The third Spnb1 mutation (spectrin-1β c) and mutation in 
      Epb4.1 (band 4.1) did not significantly affect the haematological phenotype, 
      despite these two mutations having a PolyPhen score predicting the mutation may 
      be damaging. Exome sequencing allows rapid identification of causative mutations 
      and development of databases of mutations predicted to be disruptive. These tools 
      require further refinement but provide new approaches to the study of genetically 
      defined changes that may impact on blood component storage and transfusion 
      outcome.

AB  - Nonhuman primates (NHP) provide crucial biomedical model systems intermediate 
      between rodents and humans. The vervet monkey (also called the African green 
      monkey) is a widely used NHP model that has unique value for genetic and genomic 
      investigations of traits relevant to human diseases. This article describes the 
      phylogeny and population history of the vervet monkey and summarizes the use of 
      both captive and wild vervet monkeys in biomedical research. It also discusses 
      the effort of an international collaboration to develop the vervet monkey as the 
      most comprehensively phenotypically and genomically characterized NHP, a process 
      that will enable the scientific community to employ this model for systems 
      biology investigations.

TI  - Systems biology approach reveals genome to phenome correlation in type 2 
      diabetes.
PG  - e53522

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered association of several 
      loci with Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a common complex disease characterized by 
      impaired insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells and insulin signaling in target 
      tissues. However, effect of genetic risk variants on continuous glycemic measures 
      in nondiabetic subjects mainly elucidates perturbation of insulin secretion. 
      Also, the disease associated genes do not clearly converge on functional 
      categories consistent with the known aspects of T2D pathophysiology. We used a 
      systems biology approach to unravel genome to phenome correlation in T2D. We 
      first examined enrichment of pathways in genes identified in T2D GWASs at 
      genome-wide or lower levels of significance. Genes at lower significance 
      threshold showed enrichment of insulin secretion related pathway. Notably, 
      physical and genetic interaction network of these genes showed robust enrichment 
      of insulin signaling and other T2D pathophysiology related pathways including 
      insulin secretion. The network also overrepresented genes reported to interact 
      with insulin secretion and insulin action targeting antidiabetic drugs. The drug 
      interacting genes themselves showed overrepresentation of insulin signaling and 
      other T2D relevant pathways. Next, we generated genome-wide expression profiles 
      of multiple insulin responsive tissues from nondiabetic and diabetic patients. 
      Remarkably, the differentially expressed genes showed significant overlap with 
      the network genes, with the intersection showing enrichment of insulin signaling 
      and other pathways consistent with T2D pathophysiology. Literature search led our 
      genomic, interactomic, transcriptomic and toxicogenomic evidence to converge on 
      TGF-beta signaling, a pathway known to play a crucial role in pancreatic islets 
      development and function, and insulin signaling. Cumulatively, we find that GWAS 
      genes relate directly to insulin secretion and indirectly, through collaborating 
      with other genes, to insulin resistance. This seems to support the 
      epidemiological evidence that environmentally triggered insulin resistance 
      interacts with genetically programmed β cell dysfunction to precipitate diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recognized public health relevant risk factors such as obesity, 
      physical inactivity, smoking or air pollution are common to many non-communicable 
      diseases (NCDs). NCDs cluster and co-morbidities increase in parallel to age. 
      Pleiotropic genes and genetic variants have been identified by genome-wide 
      association studies (GWAS) linking NCD entities hitherto thought to be distant in 
      etiology. These different lines of evidence suggest that NCD disease mechanisms 
      are in part shared. DISCUSSION: Identification of common exogenous and endogenous 
      risk patterns may promote efficient prevention, an urgent need in the light of 
      the global NCD epidemic. The prerequisite to investigate causal risk patterns 
      including biologic, genetic and environmental factors across different NCDs are 
      well characterized cohorts with associated biobanks. Prospectively collected data 
      and biospecimen from subjects of various age, sociodemographic, and cultural 
      groups, both healthy and affected by one or more NCD, are essential for exploring 
      biologic mechanisms and susceptibilities interlinking different environmental and 
      lifestyle exposures, co-morbidities, as well as cellular senescence and aging. A 
      paradigm shift in the research activities can currently be observed, moving from 
      focused investigations on the effect of a single risk factor on an isolated 
      health outcome to a more comprehensive assessment of risk patterns and a broader 
      phenome approach. Though important methodological and analytical challenges need 
      to be resolved, the ongoing international efforts to establish large-scale 
      population-based biobank cohorts are a critical basis for moving NCD disease 
      etiology forward. SUMMARY: Future epidemiologic and public health research should 
      aim at sustaining a comprehensive systems view on health and disease. The 
      political and public discussions about the utilitarian aspect of investing in and 
      contributing to cohort and biobank research are essential and are indirectly 
      linked to the achievement of public health programs effectively addressing the 
      global NCD epidemic.

TI  - The teeth and faces of twins: providing insights into dentofacial development and 
      oral health for practising oral health professionals.
PG  - 101-16
LID - 10.1111/adj.12101 [doi]
AB  - The continuing studies of the teeth and faces of Australian twins and their 
      families in the Craniofacial Biology Research Group in the School of Dentistry at 
      the University of Adelaide began 30 years ago. Three main cohorts of twins have 
      been recruited, enabling various objectives and specific hypotheses to be 
      addressed about the roles of genetic, epigenetic and environmental influences on 
      human dentofacial growth and development, as well as oral health. This paper 
      highlights some key findings arising from these studies, emphasizing those of 
      direct relevance to practising oral health professionals. We also draw on 
      published literature to review the significant developments in relation to the 
      use of precision 2D and 3D imaging equipment, the application of modern molecular 
      techniques, and the development of sophisticated computer software for analysing 
      genetic relationships and comparing complex shapes. Such developments are 
      valuable for current and future work. Apart from the classical or traditional 
      twin model, there are several other twin models that can be used in research to 
      clarify the relative contributions of genetic, epigenetic and environmental 
      contributions to phenotypic variation. The monozygotic (MZ) co-twin model is one 
      particularly valuable method, given that examination of only one pair of MZ twins 
      can provide considerable insights into underlying causes of observed variation. 
      This model can be used in a dental practice environment, with oral health 
      professionals having the opportunity to explore differences in orofacial 
      structures between MZ co-twins who are attending as patients. As researchers have 
      become more aware of the complexities of the interactions between the genome, the 
      epigenome and the environment during development, there is the need to collect 
      more phenotypic data and define new phenotypes that will better characterize 
      variations in growth processes and health status. When coupled with powerful new 
      genetic approaches, including genome-wide association studies and linkage 
      analyses, exciting opportunities are opening up to unravel the causes of problems 
      in craniofacial growth and common oral diseases in human populations.

TI  - LIPS database with LIPService: a microscopic image database of intracellular 
      structures in Arabidopsis guard cells.
PG  - 81
LID - 10.1186/1471-2229-13-81 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intracellular configuration is an important feature of cell status. 
      Recent advances in microscopic imaging techniques allow us to easily obtain a 
      large number of microscopic images of intracellular structures. In this 
      circumstance, automated microscopic image recognition techniques are of extreme 
      importance to future phenomics/visible screening approaches. However, there was 
      no benchmark microscopic image dataset for intracellular organelles in a 
      specified plant cell type. We previously established the Live Images of Plant 
      Stomata (LIPS) database, a publicly available collection of optical-section 
      images of various intracellular structures of plant guard cells, as a model 
      system of environmental signal perception and transduction. Here we report recent 
      updates to the LIPS database and the establishment of a database table, 
      LIPService. DESCRIPTION: We updated the LIPS dataset and established a new 
      interface named LIPService to promote efficient inspection of intracellular 
      structure configurations. Cell nuclei, microtubules, actin microfilaments, 
      mitochondria, chloroplasts, endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, endosomes, Golgi 
      bodies, and vacuoles can be filtered using probe names or morphometric parameters 
      such as stomatal aperture. In addition to the serial optical sectional images of 
      the original LIPS database, new volume-rendering data for easy web browsing of 
      three-dimensional intracellular structures have been released to allow easy 
      inspection of their configurations or relationships with cell status/morphology. 
      We also demonstrated the utility of the new LIPS image database for automated 
      organelle recognition of images from another plant cell image database with image 
      clustering analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The updated LIPS database provides a benchmark 
      image dataset for representative intracellular structures in Arabidopsis guard 
      cells. The newly released LIPService allows users to inspect the relationship 
      between organellar three-dimensional configurations and morphometrical 
      parameters.

TI  - Dilated cardiomyopathy: the complexity of a diverse genetic architecture.
PG  - 531-47
LID - 10.1038/nrcardio.2013.105 [doi]
AB  - Remarkable progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of dilated 
      cardiomyopathy (DCM). Rare variants in >30 genes, some also involved in other 
      cardiomyopathies, muscular dystrophy, or syndromic disease, perturb a diverse set 
      of important myocardial proteins to produce a final DCM phenotype. Large, 
      publicly available datasets have provided the opportunity to evaluate previously 
      identified DCM-causing mutations, and to examine the population frequency of 
      sequence variants similar to those that have been observed to cause DCM. The 
      frequency of these variants, whether associated with dilated or hypertrophic 
      cardiomyopathy, is greater than estimates of disease prevalence. This mismatch 
      might be explained by one or more of the following possibilities: that the 
      penetrance of DCM-causing mutations is lower than previously thought, that some 
      variants are noncausal, that DCM prevalence is higher than previously estimated, 
      or that other more-complex genomics underlie DCM. Reassessment of our assumptions 
      about the complexity of the genomic and phenomic architecture of DCM is 
      warranted. Much about the genomic basis of DCM remains to be investigated, which 
      will require comprehensive genomic studies in much larger cohorts of rigorously 
      phenotyped probands and family members than previously examined.

TI  - A PheWAS approach in studying HLA-DRB1*1501.
PG  - 187-91
LID - 10.1038/gene.2013.2 [doi]
AB  - HLA-DRB1 codes for a major histocompatibility complex class II cell surface 
      receptor. Genetic variants in and around this gene have been linked to numerous 
      autoimmune diseases. Most notably, an association between HLA-DRB1*1501 haplotype 
      and multiple sclerosis (MS) has been defined. Utilizing electronic health records 
      and 4235 individuals within Marshfield Clinic's Personalized Medicine Research 
      Project, a reverse genetic screen coined phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) 
      tested association of rs3135388 genotype (tagging HLA-DRB1*1501) with 4841 
      phenotypes. As expected, HLA-DRB1*1501 was associated with MS (International 
      Classification of Disease version 9-CM (ICD9) 340, P=0.023), whereas the 
      strongest association was with alcohol-induced cirrhosis of the liver (ICD9 
      571.2, P=0.00011). HLA-DRB1*1501 also demonstrated association with erythematous 
      conditions (ICD9 695, P=0.0054) and benign neoplasms of the respiratory and 
      intrathoracic organs (ICD9 212, P=0.042), replicating previous findings. This 
      study not only builds on the feasibility/utility of the PheWAS approach, 
      represents the first external validation of a PheWAS, but may also demonstrate 
      the complex etiologies associated with the HLA-DRB1*1501 loci.

AB  - Health information technologies facilitate the collection of massive quantities 
      of patient-level data. A growing body of research demonstrates that such 
      information can support novel, large-scale biomedical investigations at a 
      fraction of the cost of traditional prospective studies. While healthcare 
      organizations are being encouraged to share these data in a de-identified form, 
      there is hesitation over concerns that it will allow corresponding patients to be 
      re-identified. Currently proposed technologies to anonymize clinical data may 
      make unrealistic assumptions with respect to the capabilities of a recipient to 
      ascertain a patients identity. We show that more pragmatic assumptions enable the 
      design of anonymization algorithms that permit the dissemination of detailed 
      clinical profiles with provable guarantees of protection. We demonstrate this 
      strategy with a dataset of over one million medical records and show that 192 
      genotype-phenotype associations can be discovered with fidelity equivalent to 
      non-anonymized clinical data.

AB  - The Mouse Phenome Database (MPD; phenome.jax.org) was launched in 2001 as the 
      data coordination center for the international Mouse Phenome Project. MPD 
      integrates quantitative phenotype, gene expression and genotype data into a 
      common annotated framework to facilitate query and analysis. MPD contains >3500 
      phenotype measurements or traits relevant to human health, including cancer, 
      aging, cardiovascular disorders, obesity, infectious disease susceptibility, 
      blood disorders, neurosensory disorders, drug addiction and toxicity. Since our 
      2012 NAR report, we have added >70 new data sets, including data from 
      Collaborative Cross lines and Diversity Outbred mice. During this time we have 
      completely revamped our homepage, improved search and navigational aspects of the 
      MPD application, developed several web-enabled data analysis and visualization 
      tools, annotated phenotype data to public ontologies, developed an ontology 
      browser and released new single nucleotide polymorphism query functionality with 
      much higher density coverage than before. Here, we summarize recent data 
      acquisitions and describe our latest improvements.

LID - 10.4137/BII.S10729 [doi]
AB  - Over the course of the last few years there has been a significant amount of 
      research performed on ontology-based formalization of phenotype descriptions. The 
      intrinsic value and knowledge captured within such descriptions can only be 
      expressed by taking advantage of their inner structure that implicitly combines 
      qualities and anatomical entities. We present a meta-model (the Phenotype 
      Fragment Ontology) and a processing pipeline that enable together the automatic 
      decomposition and conceptualization of phenotype descriptions for the human 
      skeletal phenome. We use this approach to showcase the usefulness of the generic 
      concept of phenotype decomposition by performing an experimental study on all 
      skeletal phenotype concepts defined in the Human Phenotype Ontology.

TI  - Decision making with complex nonlinear systems: inference and identification in 
      the context of DS22q11.2.
PG  - 173-81
AB  - A rare gene deletion syndrome, that has in its associated phenome some possible 
      cognitive and psychotic features, has been examined with DNA and fMRI for its 
      causal basis within families and its statistical distribution in populations. 
      Identification of its presence without DNA evidence is problematic as the 
      condition is not stationary nor linear in its properties as the carrier grows 
      older. Within a family its distribution is Mendelian, but there are also 
      complications due to its complexity. A combined approach using both signal 
      detection and an extension of Bayes theorem is a possible approach to 
      discriminating between symptoms that have potentially a multi-causal basis, of 
      which 22q11.2 deletion is only one possibility. Two later issues have arisen, one 
      involving possibly at least two genetically different syndromes that result in 
      similar autism in infancy, the other in statistical problems of prediction. 
      Diagnosis of probable early DS 22q11.2 independent deaths as opposed to survival 
      into adulthood can be wrongly thought to be a case of infanticide, and legal 
      disputes have consequently arisen in the U.K., the USA, and Australia.

TI  - Describing temperament in an ungulate: a multidimensional approach.
PG  - e74579
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0074579 [doi]
LID - e74579
AB  - Studies on animal temperament have often described temperament using a 
      one-dimensional scale, whereas theoretical framework has recently suggested two 
      or more dimensions using terms like "valence" or "arousal" to describe these 
      dimensions. Yet, the valence or assessment of a situation is highly individual. 
      The aim of this study was to provide support for the multidimensional framework 
      with experimental data originating from an economically important species (Bos 
      taurus). We tested 361 calves at 90 days post natum (dpn) in a novel-object test. 
      Using a principal component analysis (PCA), we condensed numerous behaviours into 
      fewer variables to describe temperament and correlated these variables with 
      simultaneously measured heart rate variability (HRV) data. The PCA resulted in 
      two behavioural dimensions (principal components, PC): novel-object-related (PC 
      1) and exploration-activity-related (PC 2). These PCs explained 58% of the 
      variability in our data. The animals were distributed evenly within the two 
      behavioural dimensions independent of their sex. Calves with different scores in 
      these PCs differed significantly in HRV, and thus in the autonomous nervous 
      system's activity. Based on these combined behavioural and physiological data we 
      described four distinct temperament types resulting from two behavioural 
      dimensions: "neophobic/fearful--alert", "interested--stressed", 
      "subdued/uninterested--calm", and "neoophilic/outgoing--alert". Additionally, 38 
      calves were tested at 90 and 197 dpn. Using the same PCA-model, they correlated 
      significantly in PC 1 and tended to correlate in PC 2 between the two test ages. 
      Of these calves, 42% expressed a similar behaviour pattern in both dimensions and 
      47% in one. No differences in temperament scores were found between sexes or 
      breeds. In conclusion, we described distinct temperament types in calves based on 
      behavioural and physiological measures emphasising the benefits of a 
      multidimensional approach.

AB  - Plant metabolites are crucial for both plant life and human nutrition. Despite 
      recent advance in metabolomics, the genetic control of plant metabolome remains 
      largely unknown. Here, we performed a genetic analysis of the rice metabolome 
      that provided over 2,800 highly resolved metabolic quantitative trait loci for 
      900 metabolites. Distinct and overlapping accumulation patterns of metabolites 
      were observed and complex genetic regulation of metabolism was revealed in two 
      different tissues. We associated 24 candidate genes to various metabolic 
      quantitative trait loci by data mining, including ones regulating important 
      morphological traits and biological processes. The corresponding pathways were 
      reconstructed by updating in vivo functions of previously identified and newly 
      assigned genes. This study demonstrated a powerful tool and provided a vast 
      amount of high-quality data for understanding the plasticity of plant metabolome, 
      which may help bridge the gap between the genome and phenome.

TI  - Bridging the genotype-phenotype gap: what does it take?
PG  - 2055-66
LID - 10.1113/jphysiol.2012.248864 [doi]
AB  - The genotype-phenotype map (GP map) concept applies to any time point in the 
      ontogeny of a living system. It is the outcome of very complex dynamics that 
      include environmental effects, and bridging the genotype-phenotype gap is 
      synonymous with understanding these dynamics. The context for this understanding 
      is physiology, and the disciplinary goals of physiology do indeed demand the 
      physiological community to seek this understanding. We claim that this task is 
      beyond reach without use of mathematical models that bind together genetic and 
      phenotypic data in a causally cohesive way. We provide illustrations of such 
      causally cohesive genotype-phenotype models where the phenotypes span from gene 
      expression profiles to development of whole organs. Bridging the 
      genotype-phenotype gap also demands that large-scale biological ('omics') data 
      and associated bioinformatics resources be more effectively integrated with 
      computational physiology than is currently the case. A third major element is the 
      need for developing a phenomics technology way beyond current state of the art, 
      and we advocate the establishment of a Human Phenome Programme solidly grounded 
      on biophysically based mathematical descriptions of human physiology.

      mapping.
PG  - e81114

LID - e81114
AB  - BACKGROUND: Similarities between mice and humans lead to generation of many mouse 
      models of human disease. However, differences between the species often result in 
      mice being unreliable as preclinical models for human disease. One difference 
      that might play a role in lowering the predictivity of mice models to human 
      diseases is age. Despite the important role age plays in medicine, it is too 
      often considered only casually when considering mouse models. METHODS: We 
      developed the mouse-Age Phenotype Knowledgebase, which holds knowledge about 
      age-related phenotypic patterns in mice. The knowledgebase was extensively 
      populated with literature-derived data using text mining techniques. We then 
      mapped between ages in humans and mice by comparing the age distribution pattern 
      for 887 diseases in both species. RESULTS: The knowledgebase was populated with 
      over 9800 instances generated by a text-mining pipeline. The quality of the data 
      was manually evaluated, and was found to be of high accuracy (estimated precision 
      >86%). Furthermore, grouping together diseases that share similar age patterns in 
      mice resulted in clusters that mirror actual biomedical knowledge. Using these 
      data, we matched age distribution patterns in mice and in humans, allowing for 
      age differences by shifting either of the patterns. High correlation (r(2)>0.5) 
      was found for 223 diseases. The results clearly indicate a difference in the age 
      mapping between different diseases: age 30 years in human is mapped to 120 days 
      in mice for Leukemia, but to 295 days for Anemia. Based on these results we 
      generated a mice-to-human age map which is publicly available. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      present here the development of the mouse-APK, its population with 
      literature-derived data and its use to map ages in mice and human for 223 
      diseases. These results present a further step made to bridging the gap between 
      humans and mice in biomedical research.

TI  - Redefining meaningful age groups in the context of disease.
PG  - 2357-66
LID - 10.1007/s11357-013-9510-6 [doi]
AB  - Age is an important factor when considering phenotypic changes in health and 
      disease. Currently, the use of age information in medicine is somewhat 
      simplistic, with ages commonly being grouped into a small number of crude ranges 
      reflecting the major stages of development and aging, such as childhood or 
      adolescence. Here, we investigate the possibility of redefining age groups using 
      the recently developed Age-Phenome Knowledge-base (APK) that holds over 35,000 
      literature-derived entries describing relationships between age and phenotype. 
      Clustering of APK data suggests 13 new, partially overlapping, age groups. The 
      diseases that define these groups suggest that the proposed divisions are 
      biologically meaningful. We further show that the number of different age ranges 
      that should be considered depends on the type of disease being evaluated. This 
      finding was further strengthened by similar results obtained from clinical blood 
      measurement data. The grouping of diseases that share a similar pattern of 
      disease-related reports directly mirrors, in some cases, medical knowledge of 
      disease-age relationships. In other cases, our results may be used to generate 
      new and reasonable hypotheses regarding links between diseases.

AB  - Addressing the functionality of genomes is one of the most important and 
      challenging tasks of today's biology. In particular the ability to link genotypes 
      to corresponding phenotypes is of interest in the reconstruction and 
      biotechnological manipulation of metabolic pathways. Over the last years, the 
      OmniLog™ Phenotype Microarray (PM) technology has been used to address many 
      specific issues related to the metabolic functionality of microorganisms. 
      However, computational tools that could directly link PM data with the gene(s) of 
      interest followed by the extraction of information on gene-phenotype correlation 
      are still missing. Here we present DuctApe, a suite that allows the analysis of 
      both genomic sequences and PM data, to find metabolic differences among PM 
      experiments and to correlate them with KEGG pathways and gene presence/absence 
      patterns. As example, an application of the program to four bacterial datasets is 
      presented. The source code and tutorials are available at 
      http://combogenomics.github.io/DuctApe/.

AB  - Little is known about the ethnic and racial differences in the prevalence of 
      generalized and focal epilepsy among patients with non-acquired epilepsies. In 
      this study, we examined epilepsy classification and race/ethnicity in 813 
      probands from sibling or parent-child pairs with epilepsy enrolled in the 
      Epilepsy Genome/Phenome Project (EPGP). Subjects were classified as generalized 
      epilepsy (GE), non-acquired focal epilepsy (NAFE), mixed epilepsy syndrome (both 
      generalized and focal), and unclassifiable, based on consensus review of 
      semiology and available clinical, electrophysiology, and neuroimaging data. In 
      this cohort, 628 (77.2%) subjects identified exclusively as Caucasian/white and 
      65 (8.0%) subjects reported African ancestry, including subjects of mixed-race. 
      Of the Caucasian/white subjects, 357 (56.8%) had GE, 207 (33.0%) had NAFE, 32 
      (5.1%) had a mixed syndrome, and 32 (5.1%) were unclassifiable. Among subjects of 
      African ancestry, 28 (43.1%) had GE, 27 (41.5%) had NAFE, 2 (3.1%) had a mixed 
      syndrome, and 8 (12.3%) were unclassifiable. There was a higher proportion of 
      subjects with GE compared to other syndromes among Caucasians/whites compared to 
      subjects with African ancestry (OR 1.74, 95% CI: 1.04-2.92, two-tailed Fisher's 
      exact test, p=0.036). There was no difference in the rate of GE among subjects 
      reporting Hispanic ethnicity (7.6% of total) when adjusted for race 
      (Caucasian/white vs non-Caucasian/white; OR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.40-1.06, p>0.05). The 
      proportion of participants with unclassifiable epilepsy was significantly greater 
      in those of African-American descent. In a group of patients with epilepsy of 
      unknown etiology and an affected first degree relative, GE is more common among 
      Caucasian/white subjects than among those with African ancestry. These findings 
      suggest there may be geographical differences in the distribution of epilepsy 
      susceptibility genes and an effect of genetic background on epilepsy phenotype. 
      However, the results should be interpreted with caution because of the low 
      numbers of African-Americans in this cohort and more limited diagnostic data 
      available for epilepsy classification in these subjects compared to 
      Caucasians/whites.

COIS- Disclosures: Dr. Friedman receives salary support from The Epilepsy Study 
      Consortium, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the lives of 
      epilepsy patients, and devotes 15% of his time to work done for the Consortium. 
      The Consortium receives payments from a large number of pharmaceutical companies 
      for consulting activities. All payments are made to The Consortium and not to Dr. 
      Friedman directly. Several companies also support the Consortium's biennial 
      Antiepileptic Drug Trials Symposium. Since there a so many companies 
      contributing, the amount from each company towards Dr. Friedman's salary is 
      minimal and is reviewed annually by NYU's conflict of interest committee. Ms. 
      Falstrom has nothing to disclose.

AB  - We simulate the competitive uptake and transport of a mixed salt system in the 
      differentiated tissues of plant roots. The results are based on a physical model 
      that includes both forced diffusion and convection by the transpiration stream. 
      The influence of the Casparian strip on regulating apoplastic flow, the focus of 
      the paper, is modelled by varying ion diffusive permeabilities, hydraulic 
      reflection coefficients and water permeability for transport across the 
      endodermis-pericycle interface. We find that reducing diffusive permeabilities 
      leads to significantly altered ion concentration profiles in the pericycle and 
      vascular cylinder regions, while increased convective reflectivities affect 
      predominantly ion concentrations in the cortex and endodermis tissues. The 
      self-consistent electric field arising from ion separation is a major influence 
      on predicted ion fluxes and accumulation rates.

AB  - In this paper, we present and discuss a mathematical model of ion uptake and 
      transport in roots of plants. The underlying physical model of transport is based 
      on the mechanisms of forced diffusion and convection. The model can take account 
      of local variations in effective ion and water permeabilities across the major 
      tissue regions of plant roots, represented through a discretized coupled system 
      of governing equations including mass balance, forced diffusion, convection and 
      electric potential. We present simulation results of an exploration of the 
      consequent enormous parameter space. Among our findings we identify the electric 
      potential as a major factor affecting ion transport across, and accumulation in, 
      root tissues. We also find that under conditions of a constant but realistic 
      level of bulk soil salt concentration and plant-soil hydraulic pressure, 
      diffusion plays a significant role even when convection by the water 
      transpiration stream is operating.

TI  - A hyperspectral imaging system for an accurate prediction of the above-ground 
      biomass of individual rice plants.

LID - 10.1063/1.4818918 [doi]
AB  - Biomass is an important component of the plant phenomics, and the existing 
      methods for biomass estimation for individual plants are either destructive or 
      lack accuracy. In this study, a hyperspectral imaging system was developed for 
      the accurate prediction of the above-ground biomass of individual rice plants in 
      the visible and near-infrared spectral region. First, the structure of the system 
      and the influence of various parameters on the camera acquisition speed were 
      established. Then the system was used to image 152 rice plants, which selected 
      from the rice mini-core collection, in two stages, the tillering to elongation 
      (T-E) stage and the booting to heading (B-H) stage. Several variables were 
      extracted from the images. Following, linear stepwise regression analysis and 
      5-fold cross-validation were used to select effective variables for model 
      construction and test the stability of the model, respectively. For the T-E 
      stage, the R(2) value was 0.940 for the fresh weight (FW) and 0.935 for the dry 
      weight (DW). For the B-H stage, the R(2) value was 0.891 for the FW and 0.783 for 
      the DW. Moreover, estimations of the biomass using visible light images were also 
      calculated. These comparisons showed that hyperspectral imaging performed better 
      than the visible light imaging. Therefore, this study provides not only a stable 
      hyperspectral imaging platform but also an accurate and nondestructive method for 
      the prediction of biomass for individual rice plants.

TI  - The complete genome and phenome of a community-acquired Acinetobacter baumannii.
PG  - e58628
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0058628 [doi]
LID - e58628
AB  - Many sequenced strains of Acinetobacter baumannii are established nosocomial 
      pathogens capable of resistance to multiple antimicrobials. Community-acquired A. 
      baumannii in contrast, comprise a minor proportion of all A. baumannii infections 
      and are highly susceptible to antimicrobial treatment. However, these infections 
      also present acute clinical manifestations associated with high reported rates of 
      mortality. We report the complete 3.70 Mbp genome of A. baumannii D1279779, 
      previously isolated from the bacteraemic infection of an Indigenous Australian; 
      this strain represents the first community-acquired A. baumannii to be sequenced. 
      Comparative analysis of currently published A. baumannii genomes identified 
      twenty-four accessory gene clusters present in D1279779. These accessory elements 
      were predicted to encode a range of functions including polysaccharide 
      biosynthesis, type I DNA restriction-modification, and the metabolism of novel 
      carbonaceous and nitrogenous compounds. Conversely, twenty genomic regions 
      present in previously sequenced A. baumannii strains were absent in D1279779, 
      including gene clusters involved in the catabolism of 4-hydroxybenzoate and 
      glucarate, and the A. baumannii antibiotic resistance island, known to bestow 
      resistance to multiple antimicrobials in nosocomial strains. Phenomic analysis 
      utilising the Biolog Phenotype Microarray system indicated that A. baumannii 
      D1279779 can utilise a broader range of carbon and nitrogen sources than 
      international clone I and clone II nosocomial isolates. However, D1279779 was 
      more sensitive to antimicrobial compounds, particularly beta-lactams, 
      tetracyclines and sulphonamides. The combined genomic and phenomic analyses have 
      provided insight into the features distinguishing A. baumannii isolated from 
      community-acquired and nosocomial infections.

TI  - Metabolomics in adult and pediatric nephrology.
PG  - 4844-57
LID - 10.3390/molecules18054844 [doi]
AB  - Metabolomics, the latest of the "omics" sciences, has a non-selective approach 
      and can thus lead to the identification of all the metabolites (molecules < 1 
      kDa) in a biological system. The metabolomic profile can be considered the most 
      predictive phenotype capable of evaluating epigenetic modifications determined by 
      external factors. It is so close to the phenotype as to be considered the 
      phenotype itself in its unique individuality (fingerprinting), both in health 
      (phenome), and disease (diseasome). Urine, compared to other biological liquids, 
      has the advantage of being a complex fluid with many components, including 
      intermediate metabolites. Metabolomics may thus play a role in the study of 
      different kidney diseases and overcome diagnostic difficulties. We shall present 
      the studies that to our knowledge have been published on Nephrology and Pediatric 
      Nephrology. Some are experimental while others are clinical. We have not 
      considered carcinomas and transplantations. Although scarce, the data on adults 
      and the very few ones in pediatrics are quite interesting. Further studies on 
      kidneys are needed to determine the practical clinical impact of metabolomics in 
      kidney renal pathologies. The "multiplatform" "omic" study of urine and namely 
      metabolomics can contribute to improving early diagnosis and the outcome of 
      kidney diseases.

TI  - Mining the human phenome using allelic scores that index biological 
      intermediates.
PG  - e1003919
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003919 [doi]
LID - e1003919
AB  - It is common practice in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to focus on the 
      relationship between disease risk and genetic variants one marker at a time. When 
      relevant genes are identified it is often possible to implicate biological 
      intermediates and pathways likely to be involved in disease aetiology. However, 
      single genetic variants typically explain small amounts of disease risk. Our idea 
      is to construct allelic scores that explain greater proportions of the variance 
      in biological intermediates, and subsequently use these scores to data mine GWAS. 
      To investigate the approach's properties, we indexed three biological 
      intermediates where the results of large GWAS meta-analyses were available: body 
      mass index, C-reactive protein and low density lipoprotein levels. We generated 
      allelic scores in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, and in 
      publicly available data from the first Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. We 
      compared the explanatory ability of allelic scores in terms of their capacity to 
      proxy for the intermediate of interest, and the extent to which they associated 
      with disease. We found that allelic scores derived from known variants and 
      allelic scores derived from hundreds of thousands of genetic markers explained 
      significant portions of the variance in biological intermediates of interest, and 
      many of these scores showed expected correlations with disease. Genome-wide 
      allelic scores however tended to lack specificity suggesting that they should be 
      used with caution and perhaps only to proxy biological intermediates for which 
      there are no known individual variants. Power calculations confirm the 
      feasibility of extending our strategy to the analysis of tens of thousands of 
      molecular phenotypes in large genome-wide meta-analyses. We conclude that our 
      method represents a simple way in which potentially tens of thousands of 
      molecular phenotypes could be screened for causal relationships with disease 
      without having to expensively measure these variables in individual disease 
      collections.

TI  - Phenomics of cardiac chloride channels.
PG  - 667-92
LID - 10.1002/cphy.c110014 [doi]
AB  - Forward genetic studies have identified several chloride (Cl-) channel genes, 
      including CFTR, ClC-2, ClC-3, CLCA, Bestrophin, and Ano1, in the heart. Recent 
      reverse genetic studies using gene targeting and transgenic techniques to 
      delineate the functional role of cardiac Cl- channels have shown that Cl- 
      channels may contribute to cardiac arrhythmogenesis, myocardial hypertrophy and 
      heart failure, and cardioprotection against ischemia reperfusion. The study of 
      physiological or pathophysiological phenotypes of cardiac Cl- channels, however, 
      is complicated by the compensatory changes in the animals in response to the 
      targeted genetic manipulation. Alternatively, tissue-specific conditional or 
      inducible knockout or knockin animal models may be more valuable in the 
      phenotypic studies of specific Cl- channels by limiting the effect of 
      compensation on the phenotype. The integrated function of Cl- channels may 
      involve multiprotein complexes of the Cl- channel subproteome. Similar phenotypes 
      can be attained from alternative protein pathways within cellular networks, which 
      are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The phenomics approach, 
      which characterizes phenotypes as a whole phenome and systematically studies the 
      molecular changes that give rise to particular phenotypes achieved by modifying 
      the genotype under the scope of genome/proteome/phenome, may provide more 
      complete understanding of the integrated function of each cardiac Cl- channel in 
      the context of health and disease.

AB  - The zebrafish mutation project (ZMP) aims to generate a loss of function allele 
      for every protein-coding gene, but importantly to also characterise the 
      phenotypes of these alleles during the first five days of development. Such a 
      large-scale screen requires a systematic approach both to identifying phenotypes, 
      and also to linking those phenotypes to specific mutations. This phenotyping 
      pipeline simultaneously assesses the consequences of multiple alleles in a 
      two-step process. First, mutations that do not produce a visible phenotype during 
      the first five days of development are identified, while a second round of 
      phenotyping focuses on detailed analysis of those alleles that are suspected to 
      cause a phenotype. Allele-specific PCR single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
      assays are used to genotype F2 parents and individual F3 fry for mutations known 
      to be present in the F1 founder. With this method specific phenotypes can be 
      linked to induced mutations. In addition a method is described for cryopreserving 
      sperm samples of mutagenised males and their subsequent use for in vitro 
      fertilisation to generate F2 families for phenotyping. Ultimately this approach 
      will lead to the functional annotation of the zebrafish genome, which will deepen 
      our understanding of gene function in development and disease.

AB  - Cognitive deficits are core to the disability associated with many psychiatric 
      disorders. Both variation in cognition and psychiatric risk show substantial 
      heritability, with overlapping genetic variants contributing to both. 
      Unsurprisingly, therefore, these fields have been mutually beneficial : just as 
      cognitive studies of psychiatric risk variants may identify genes involved in 
      cognition, so too can genome-wide studies based on cognitive phenotypes lead to 
      genes relevant to psychiatric aetiology. The purpose of this review is to 
      consider the main issues involved in the phenotypic characterization of 
      cognition, and to describe the challenges associated with the transition to 
      genomewide approaches. We conclude by describing the approaches currently being 
      taken by the international consortia involving many investigators in the field 
      internationally (e.g. Cognitive Genomics Consortium; COGENT) to overcome these 
      challenges.

TI  - Can root electrical capacitance be used to predict root mass in soil?
PG  - 457-64
LID - 10.1093/aob/mct044 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electrical capacitance, measured between an electrode inserted at the 
      base of a plant and an electrode in the rooting substrate, is often linearly 
      correlated with root mass. Electrical capacitance has often been used as an assay 
      for root mass, and is conventionally interpreted using an electrical model in 
      which roots behave as cylindrical capacitors wired in parallel. Recent 
      experiments in hydroponics show that this interpretation is incorrect and a new 
      model has been proposed. Here, the new model is tested in solid substrates. 
      METHODS: The capacitances of compost and soil were determined as a function of 
      water content, and the capacitances of cereal plants growing in sand or potting 
      compost in the glasshouse, or in the field, were measured under contrasting 
      irrigation regimes. KEY RESULTS: Capacitances of compost and soil increased with 
      increasing water content. At water contents approaching field capacity, compost 
      and soil had capacitances at least an order of magnitude greater than those of 
      plant tissues. For plants growing in solid substrates, wetting the substrate 
      locally around the stem base was both necessary and sufficient to record maximum 
      capacitance, which was correlated with stem cross-sectional area: capacitance of 
      excised stem tissue equalled that of the plant in wet soil. Capacitance measured 
      between two electrodes could be modelled as an electrical circuit in which 
      component capacitors (plant tissue or rooting substrate) are wired in series. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results were consistent with the new physical interpretation of 
      plant capacitance. Substrate capacitance and plant capacitance combine according 
      to standard physical laws. For plants growing in wet substrate, the capacitance 
      measured is largely determined by the tissue between the surface of the substrate 
      and the electrode attached to the plant. Whilst the measured capacitance can, in 
      some circumstances, be correlated with root mass, it is not a direct assay of 
      root mass.

AB  - Imaging and image processing have revolutionized plant phenotyping and are now a 
      major tool for phenotypic trait measurement. Here we review plant phenotyping 
      systems by examining three important characteristics: throughput, dimensionality, 
      and resolution. First, whole-plant phenotyping systems are highlighted together 
      with advances in automation that enable significant throughput increases. Organ 
      and cellular level phenotyping and its tools, often operating at a lower 
      throughput, are then discussed as a means to obtain high-dimensional phenotypic 
      data at elevated spatial and temporal resolution. The significance of recent 
      developments in sensor technologies that give access to plant morphology and 
      physiology-related traits is shown. Overall, attention is focused on spatial and 
      temporal resolution because these are crucial aspects of imaging procedures in 
      plant phenotyping systems.

TI  - Systematic comparison of phenome-wide association study of electronic medical 
      record data and genome-wide association study data.
PG  - 1102-10
AB  - Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic 
      variants that modulate risk for human disease; many of these associations require 
      further study to replicate the results. Here we report the first large-scale 
      application of the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) paradigm within 
      electronic medical records (EMRs), an unbiased approach to replication and 
      discovery that interrogates relationships between targeted genotypes and multiple 
      phenotypes. We scanned for associations between 3,144 single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (previously implicated by GWAS as mediators of human traits) and 
      1,358 EMR-derived phenotypes in 13,835 individuals of European ancestry. This 
      PheWAS replicated 66% (51/77) of sufficiently powered prior GWAS associations and 
      revealed 63 potentially pleiotropic associations with P < 4.6 × 10⁻⁶ (false 
      discovery rate < 0.1); the strongest of these novel associations were replicated 
      in an independent cohort (n = 7,406). These findings validate PheWAS as a tool to 
      allow unbiased interrogation across multiple phenotypes in EMR-based cohorts and 
      to enhance analysis of the genomic basis of human disease.

TI  - Exome capture sequencing reveals new insights into hepatitis B virus-induced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma at the early stage of tumorigenesis.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer, is the 
      third primary cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The molecular 
      mechanisms underlying the initiation and formation of HCC remain obscure. In the 
      present study, we performed exome sequencing using tumor and normal tissues from 
      3 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive BCLC stage A HCC patients. Bioinformatic 
      analysis was performed to find candidate protein-altering somatic mutations. 
      Eighty damaging mutations were validated and 59 genes were reported to be mutated 
      in HBV-related HCCs for the first time here. Further analysis using whole genome 
      sequencing (WGS) data of 88 HBV-related HCC patients from the European 
      Genome-phenome Archive database showed that mutations in 33 of the 59 genes were 
      also detected in other samples. Variants of two newly found genes, ZNF717 and 
      PARP4, were detected in more than 10% of the WGS samples. Several other genes, 
      such as FLNA and CNTN2, are also noteworthy. Thus, the exome sequencing analysis 
      of three BCLC stage A patients provides new insights into the molecular events 
      governing the early steps of HBV-induced HCC tumorigenesis.

AB  - To extend agricultural productivity by knowledge-based breeding and tailor 
      varieties adapted to specific environmental conditions, it is imperative to 
      improve our ability to assess the dynamic changes of the phenome of crops under 
      field conditions. To this end, we have developed a precision phenotyping platform 
      that combines various sensors for a non-invasive, high-throughput and 
      high-dimensional phenotyping of small grain cereals. This platform yielded high 
      prediction accuracies and heritabilities for biomass of triticale. Genetic 
      variation for biomass accumulation was dissected with 647 doubled haploid lines 
      derived from four families. Employing a genome-wide association mapping approach, 
      two major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for biomass were identified and the 
      genetic architecture of biomass accumulation was found to be characterized by 
      dynamic temporal patterns. Our findings highlight the potential of precision 
      phenotyping to assess the dynamic genetics of complex traits, especially those 
      not amenable to traditional phenotyping.

AB  - The phenotype represents a critical interface between the genome and the 
      environment in which organisms live and evolve. Phenotypic characters also are a 
      rich source of biodiversity data for tree building, and they enable scientists to 
      reconstruct the evolutionary history of organisms, including most fossil taxa, 
      for which genetic data are unavailable. Therefore, phenotypic data are necessary 
      for building a comprehensive Tree of Life. In contrast to recent advances in 
      molecular sequencing, which has become faster and cheaper through recent 
      technological advances, phenotypic data collection remains often prohibitively 
      slow and expensive. The next-generation phenomics project is a collaborative, 
      multidisciplinary effort to leverage advances in image analysis, crowdsourcing, 
      and natural language processing to develop and implement novel approaches for 
      discovering and scoring the phenome, the collection of phentotypic characters for 
      a species. This research represents a new approach to data collection that has 
      the potential to transform phylogenetics research and to enable rapid advances in 
      constructing the Tree of Life. Our goal is to assemble large phenomic datasets 
      built using new methods and to provide the public and scientific community with 
      tools for phenomic data assembly that will enable rapid and automated study of 
      phenotypes across the Tree of Life.

AB  - Reduced costs and increased speed and accuracy of sequencing can bring the 
      genome-based evaluation of individual disease risk to the bedside. While past 
      efforts have identified a number of actionable mutations, the bulk of genetic 
      risk remains hidden in sequence data. The biggest challenge facing genomic 
      medicine today is the development of new techniques to predict the specifics of a 
      given human phenome (set of all expressed phenotypes) encoded by each individual 
      variome (full set of genome variants) in the context of the given environment. 
      Numerous tools exist for the computational identification of the functional 
      effects of a single variant. However, the pipelines taking advantage of full 
      genomic, exomic, transcriptomic (and other) sequences have only recently become a 
      reality. This review looks at the building of methodologies for predicting

AB  - The pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is not yet known; however, 
      studies suggest that dysfunction of the immune system affects many children with 
      ASD. Increasing evidence points to dysfunction of the innate immune system 
      including activation of microglia and perivascular macrophages, increases in 
      inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in brain tissue and CSF, and abnormal 
      peripheral monocyte cell function. Dendritic cells are major players in innate 
      immunity and have important functions in the phagocytosis of pathogens or debris, 
      antigen presentation, activation of naïve T cells, induction of tolerance and 
      cytokine/chemokine production. In this study, we assessed circulating frequencies 
      of myeloid dendritic cells (defined as Lin-1(-)BDCA1(+)CD11c(+) and 
      Lin-1(-)BDCA3(+)CD123(-)) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells 
      (Lin-1(-)BDCA2(+)CD123(+) or Lin-1(-)BDCA4(+) CD11c(-)) in 57 children with ASD, 
      and 29 typically developing controls of the same age, all of who were enrolled as 
      part of the Autism Phenome Project (APP). The frequencies of dendritic cells and 
      associations with behavioral assessment and MRI measurements of amygdala volume 
      were compared in the same participants. The frequencies of myeloid dendritic 
      cells were significantly increased in children with ASD compared to typically 
      developing controls (p<0.03). Elevated frequencies of myeloid dendritic cells 
      were positively associated with abnormal right and left amygdala enlargement, 
      severity of gastrointestinal symptoms and increased repetitive behaviors. The 
      frequencies of plasmacytoid dendritic cells were also associated with amygdala 
      volumes as well as developmental regression in children with ASD. Dendritic cells 
      play key roles in modulating immune responses and differences in frequencies or 
      functions of these cells may result in immune dysfunction in children with ASD. 
      These data further implicate innate immune cells in the complex pathophysiology 
      of ASD.

AB  - The Human Proteome Project (HPP) is designed to generate a comprehensive map of 
      the protein-based molecular architecture of the human body, to provide a resource 
      to help elucidate biological and molecular function, and to advance diagnosis and 
      treatment of diseases. Within this framework, the chromosome-based HPP (C-HPP) 
      has allocated responsibility for mapping individual chromosomes by country or 
      region, while the biology/disease HPP (B/D-HPP) coordinates these teams in 
      cross-functional disease-based groups. Chromosome 6 (Ch6) provides an excellent 
      model for integration of these two tasks. This metacentric chromosome has a 
      complement of 1002-1034 genes that code for known, novel or putative proteins. 
      Ch6 is functionally associated with more than 120 major human diseases, many with 
      high population prevalence, devastating clinical impact and profound societal 
      consequences. The unique combination of genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, phenomic 
      and health services data being drawn together within the Ch6 program has enormous 
      potential to advance personalized medicine by promoting robust biomarkers, 
      subunit vaccines and new drug targets. The strong liaison between the clinical 
      and laboratory teams, and the structured framework for technology transfer and 
      health policy decisions within Canada will increase the speed and efficacy of 
      this transition, and the value of this translational research. BIOLOGICAL 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Canada has been selected to play a leading role in the 
      international Human Proteome Project, the global counterpart of the Human Genome 
      Project designed to understand the structure and function of the human proteome 
      in health and disease. Canada will lead an international team focusing on 
      chromosome 6, which is functionally associated with more than 120 major human 
      diseases, including immune and inflammatory disorders affecting the brain, 
      skeletal system, heart and blood vessels, lungs, kidney, liver, gastrointestinal 
      tract and endocrine system. Many of these chronic and persistent diseases have a 
      high population prevalence, devastating clinical impact and profound societal 
      consequences. As a result, they impose a multi-billion dollar economic burden on 
      Canada and on all advanced societies through direct costs of patient care, the 
      loss of health and productivity, and extensive caregiver burden. There is no 
      definitive treatment at the present time for any of these disorders. The 
      manuscript outlines the research which will involve a systematic assessment of 
      all chromosome 6 genes, development of a knowledge base, and development of 
      assays and reagents for all chromosome 6 proteins. We feel that the informatic 
      infrastructure and MRM assays developed will place the chromosome 6 consortium in 
      an excellent position to be a leading player in this major international research 
      initiative. This article is part of a Special Issue: Can Proteomics Fill the Gap 
      Between Genomics and Phenotypes?

TI  - Heterosis, stress, and the environment: a possible road map towards the general 
      improvement of crop yield.
PG  - 4829-37
LID - 10.1093/jxb/ert289 [doi]
AB  - Contemporary plant breeding is under pressure to improve crop productivity at a 
      rate surpassing past achievements. Different research groups dealing with this 
      issue reached similar conclusions that the solution lies in improved biomass 
      production by way of enhanced light capture and use efficiency, modified 
      photosystem biochemistry, and improved partitioning of assimilates to the 
      economic part of the plant. There seems to be a consensus of sorts. This 'opinion 
      paper' calls attention to the phenomenon of heterosis, as expressed in maize, 
      sorghum, and other crops where, depending on the case and the trait, larger 
      biomass and greater yield have been achieved without a change in growth duration, 
      photosystem biochemistry, or harvest index. This discussion maintains that there 
      is no consensus about the genetics or the genomics of heterosis in regulating 
      yield under diverse environments. Therefore, in a search for the basis of 
      heterosis in yield and adaptation, the discussion bypasses the genetics and 
      searches for answers in the phenomics of heterosis. The heterotic phenotype in 
      itself provides challenging and important hints towards improving the yield of 
      open-pollinated crops in general. These hints are linked to the homeostasis of 
      photosynthesis with respect to temperature, the photobiology of the plant as 
      mediated by phytochrome, the architectural foundations of the formation of a 
      large sink, and the associated hormones and signals in controlling sink 
      differentiation and source-sink communication. This discussion does not lay out 
      plans and protocols but provides clues to explore within and beyond the current 
      thinking about breeding for high yield.

TI  - The facial evolution: looking backward and moving forward.
PG  - 14-22
LID - 10.1002/humu.22219 [doi]
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) facial analysis is ideal for high-resolution, nonionizing, 
      noninvasive objective, high-throughput phenotypic, and phenomic studies. It is a 
      natural complement to (epi)genetic technologies to facilitate advances in the 
      understanding of rare and common diseases. The face is uniquely reflective of the 
      primordial tissues, and there is evidence supporting the application of 3D facial 
      analysis to the investigation of variation and disease including studies showing 
      that the face can reflect systemic health, provides diagnostic clues to 
      disorders, and that facial variation reflects biological pathways. In addition, 
      facial variation has been related to evolutionary factors. The purpose of this 
      review is to look backward to suggest that knowledge of human evolution supports, 
      and may instruct, the application and interpretation of studies of facial 
      morphology for documentation of human variation and investigation of its 
      relationships with health and disease. Furthermore, in the context of advances of 
      deep phenotyping and data integration, to look forward to suggest approaches to 
      scalable implementation of facial analysis, and to suggest avenues for future 
      research and clinical application of this technology.

TI  - PGMRA: a web server for (phenotype x genotype) many-to-many relation analysis in 
      GWAS.
PG  - W142-9
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkt496 [doi]
AB  - It has been proposed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered by 
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) account for only a small fraction of the 
      genetic variation of complex traits in human population. The remaining 
      unexplained variance or missing heritability is thought to be due to marginal 
      effects of many loci with small effects and has eluded attempts to identify its 
      sources. Combination of different studies appears to resolve in part this 
      problem. However, neither individual GWAS nor meta-analytic combinations thereof 
      are helpful for disclosing which genetic variants contribute to explain a 
      particular phenotype. Here, we propose that most of the missing heritability is 
      latent in the GWAS data, which conceals intermediate phenotypes. To uncover such 
      latent information, we propose the PGMRA server that introduces phenomics--the 
      full set of phenotype features of an individual--to identify SNP-set structures 
      in a broader sense, i.e. causally cohesive genotype-phenotype relations. These 
      relations are agnostically identified (without considering disease status of the 
      subjects) and organized in an interpretable fashion. Then, by incorporating a 
      posteriori the subject status within each relation, we can establish the risk 
      surface of a disease in an unbiased mode. This approach complements-instead of 
      replaces-current analysis methods. The server is publically available at 
      http://phop.ugr.es/fenogeno.

TI  - De novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathies.
PG  - 217-21

AB  - Epileptic encephalopathies are a devastating group of severe childhood epilepsy 
      disorders for which the cause is often unknown. Here we report a screen for de 
      novo mutations in patients with two classical epileptic encephalopathies: 
      infantile spasms (n = 149) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 115). We sequenced 
      the exomes of 264 probands, and their parents, and confirmed 329 de novo 
      mutations. A likelihood analysis showed a significant excess of de novo mutations 
      in the ∼4,000 genes that are the most intolerant to functional genetic variation 
      in the human population (P = 2.9 × 10(-3)). Among these are GABRB3, with de novo 
      mutations in four patients, and ALG13, with the same de novo mutation in two 
      patients; both genes show clear statistical evidence of association with 
      epileptic encephalopathy. Given the relevant site-specific mutation rates, the 
      probabilities of these outcomes occurring by chance are P = 4.1 × 10(-10) and P = 
      7.8 × 10(-12), respectively. Other genes with de novo mutations in this cohort 
      include CACNA1A, CHD2, FLNA, GABRA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B, HNRNPU, IQSEC2, MTOR and 
      NEDD4L. Finally, we show that the de novo mutations observed are enriched in 
      specific gene sets including genes regulated by the fragile X protein 
      (P < 10(-8)), as has been reported previously for autism spectrum disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects approximately 
      50 million people worldwide. Both risk of epilepsy and response to treatment 
      partly depend on genetic factors, and gene identification is a promising approach 
      to target new prediction, treatment, and prevention strategies. However, despite 
      significant progress in the identification of genes causing epilepsy in families 
      with a Mendelian inheritance pattern, there is relatively little known about the 
      genetic factors responsible for common forms of epilepsy and so-called epileptic 
      encephalopathies. Study design The Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP) is a 
      multi-institutional, retrospective phenotype-genotype study designed to gather 
      and analyze detailed phenotypic information and DNA samples on 5250 participants, 
      including probands with specific forms of epilepsy and, in a subset, parents of 
      probands who do not have epilepsy. RESULTS: EPGP is being executed in four 
      phases: study initiation, pilot, study expansion/establishment, and close-out. 
      This article discusses a number of key challenges and solutions encountered 
      during the first three phases of the project, including those related to (1) 
      study initiation and management, (2) recruitment and phenotyping, and (3) data 
      validation. The study has now enrolled 4223 participants. CONCLUSIONS: EPGP has 
      demonstrated the value of organizing a large network into cores with specific 
      roles, managed by a strong Administrative Core that utilizes frequent 
      communication and a collaborative model with tools such as study timelines and 
      performance-payment models. The study also highlights the critical importance of 
      an effective informatics system, highly structured recruitment methods, and 
      expert data review.
