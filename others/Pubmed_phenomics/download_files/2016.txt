TI  - Automatic Spectroscopic Data Categorization by Clustering Analysis (ASCLAN): A 
      Data-Driven Approach for Distinguishing Discriminatory Metabolites for Phenotypic 
      Subclasses.
PG  - 5670-9
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04020 [doi]
AB  - We propose a novel data-driven approach aiming to reliably distinguish 
      discriminatory metabolites from nondiscriminatory metabolites for a given 
      spectroscopic data set containing two biological phenotypic subclasses. The 
      automatic spectroscopic data categorization by clustering analysis (ASCLAN) 
      algorithm aims to categorize spectral variables within a data set into three 
      clusters corresponding to noise, nondiscriminatory and discriminatory metabolites 
      regions. This is achieved by clustering each spectral variable based on the r(2) 
      value representing the loading weight of each spectral variable as extracted from 
      a orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant (OPLS-DA) model of the data set. 
      The variables are ranked according to r(2) values and a series of principal 
      component analysis (PCA) models are then built for subsets of these spectral data 
      corresponding to ranges of r(2) values. The Q(2)X value for each PCA model is 
      extracted. K-means clustering is then applied to the Q(2)X values to generate two 
      clusters based on minimum Euclidean distance criterion. The cluster consisting of 
      lower Q(2)X values is deemed devoid of metabolic information (noise), while the 
      cluster consists of higher Q(2)X values is then further subclustered into two 
      groups based on the r(2) values. We considered the cluster with high Q(2)X but 
      low r(2) values as nondiscriminatory, while the cluster with high Q(2)X and r(2) 
      values as discriminatory variables. The boundaries between these three clusters 
      of spectral variables, on the basis of the r(2) values were considered as the cut 
      off values for defining the noise, nondiscriminatory and discriminatory 
      variables. We evaluated the ASCLAN algorithm using six simulated (1)H NMR 
      spectroscopic data sets representing small, medium and large data sets (N = 50, 
      500, and 1000 samples per group, respectively), each with a reduced and full 
      resolution set of variables (0.005 and 0.0005 ppm, respectively). ASCLAN 
      correctly identified all discriminatory metabolites and showed zero false 
      positive (100% specificity and positive predictive value) irrespective of the 
      spectral resolution or the sample size in all six simulated data sets. This error 
      rate was found to be superior to existing methods for ascertaining feature 
      significance: univariate t test by Bonferroni correction (up to 10% false 
      positive rate), Benjamini-Hochberg correction (up to 35% false positive rate) and 
      metabolome wide significance level (MWSL, up to 0.4% false positive rate), as 
      well as by various OPLS-DA parameters: variable importance to projection, (up to 
      15% false positive rate), loading coefficients (up to 35% false positive rate), 
      and regression coefficients (up to 39% false positive rate). The application of 
      ASCLAN was further exemplified using a widely investigated renal toxin, mercury 
      II chloride (HgCl2) in rat model. ASCLAN successfully identified many of the 
      known metabolites related to renal toxicity such as increased excretion of 
      urinary creatinine, and different amino acids. The ASCLAN algorithm provides a 
      framework for reliably differentiating discriminatory metabolites from 
      nondiscriminatory metabolites in a biological data set without the need to set an 
      arbitrary cut off value as applied to some of the conventional methods. This 
      offers significant advantages over existing methods and the possibility for 
      automation of high-throughput screening in "omics" data.

AB  - Endometriosis is a heritable, complex chronic inflammatory disease, for which 
      much of the causal pathogenic mechanism remains unknown. Genome-wide association 
      studies (GWAS) to date have identified 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms at 10 
      independent genetic loci associated with endometriosis. Most of these were more 
      strongly associated with revised American Fertility Society stage III/IV, rather 
      than stage I/II. The loci are almost all located in intergenic regions that are 
      known to play a role in the regulation of expression of target genes yet to be 
      identified. To identify the target genes and pathways perturbed by the implicated 
      variants, studies are required involving functional genomic annotation of the 
      surrounding chromosomal regions, in terms of transcription factor binding, 
      epigenetic modification (e.g., DNA methylation and histone modification) sites, 
      as well as their correlation with RNA transcription. These studies need to be 
      conducted in tissue types relevant to endometriosis-in particular, endometrium. 
      In addition, to allow biologically and clinically relevant interpretation of 
      molecular profiling data, they need to be combined and correlated with detailed, 
      systematically collected phenotypic information (surgical and clinical). The WERF 
      Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking Harmonisation Project is a global 
      standardization initiative that has produced consensus data and sample collection 
      protocols for endometriosis research. These now pave the way for collaborative 
      studies integrating phenomic with genomic data, to identify informative subtypes 
      of endometriosis that will enhance understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of 
      the disease and discovery of novel, targeted treatments.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Human primary cells originating from different locations within the 
      body could differ greatly in their metabolic phenotypes, influencing both how 
      they act during physiological/pathological processes and how 
      susceptible/resistant they are to a variety of disease risk factors. A novel way 
      to monitor cellular metabolism is through cell energetics assays, so we explored 
      this approach with human primary cell types, as models of sclerotic disorders. 
      OBJECTIVES: In order to better understand pathophysiological processes at the 
      cellular level, our goals were to measure metabolic pathway activities of 
      endothelial cells and fibroblasts, and determine their metabolic phenotype 
      profiles. METHODS: Biolog Phenotype MicroArray™ technology was used for the first 
      time to characterize metabolic phenotypes of diverse primary cells. These 
      colorimetric assays enable detection of utilization of 367 specific biochemical 
      substrates by human endothelial cells from the coronary artery (HCAEC), umbilical 
      vein (HUVEC) and normal, healthy lung fibroblasts (NHLF). RESULTS: Adenosine, 
      inosine, d-mannose and dextrin were strongly utilized by all three cell types, 
      comparable to glucose. Substrates metabolized solely by HCAEC were mannan, 
      pectin, gelatin and prevalently tricarballylic acid. HUVEC did not show any 
      uniquely metabolized substrates whereas NHLF exhibited strong utilization of 
      sugars and carboxylic acids along with amino acids and peptides. CONCLUSION: 
      Taken together, we show for the first time that this simple energetics assay 
      platform enables metabolic characterization of primary cells and that each of the 
      three human cell types examined gives a unique and distinguishable profile.

      systems biology research.
PG  - 1049-57
LID - 10.1111/pce.12673 [doi]
AB  - A paradigm shift is needed and timely in moving plant modelling from largely 
      isolated efforts to a connected community endeavour that can take full advantage 
      of advances in computer science and in mechanistic understanding of plant 
      processes. Plants in silico (Psi) envisions a digital representation of layered 
      dynamic modules, linking from gene networks and metabolic pathways through to 
      cellular organization, tissue, organ and whole plant development, together with 
      resource capture and use efficiency in dynamic competitive environments, 
      ultimately allowing a mechanistically rich simulation of the plant or of a 
      community of plants in silico. The concept is to integrate models or modules from 
      different layers of organization spanning from genome to phenome to ecosystem in 
      a modular framework allowing the use of modules of varying mechanistic detail 
      representing the same biological process. Developments in high-performance 
      computing, functional knowledge of plants, the internet and open-source version 
      controlled software make achieving the concept realistic. Open source will 
      enhance collaboration and move towards testing and consensus on quantitative 
      theoretical frameworks. Importantly, Psi provides a quantitative knowledge 
      framework where the implications of a discovery at one level, for example, single 
      gene function or developmental response, can be examined at the whole plant or 
      even crop and natural ecosystem levels.

      natural genetic variation on GDF11 levels are currently undefined. We tested 
      whether genetic background determines serum GDF11 concentrations using two 
      classical inbred mouse strains: C57BL/6J (B6) and BALB/cByJ (BALB). B6 mice 
      exhibited significantly higher GDF11 levels than BALB mice, and these strain 
      differences were consistent throughout the life span. Overall, interactions 
      between age and genetic background determined GDF11 concentrations, which were 
      unaffected by sex. We then surveyed a panel of 22 genetically diverse inbred 
      mouse strains and discovered a sixfold range in GDF11 levels at middle age. We 
      estimated that 74.52% of phenotypic variation in GDF11 levels was attributable to 
      genetic background. We used the Mouse Phenome Database to screen for phenotypes 
      that correlate with GDF11. Interestingly, GDF11 levels predicted median strain 
      life spans. This study revealed high heritability of GDF11 levels. Furthermore, 
      our correlative data suggest that GDF11 may serve as a novel predictor of 
      mammalian life span.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discover diverse genotype-phenotype associations affiliated with 
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) via genome-wide association study (GWAS) and 
      phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), more cases (T2DM subjects) and controls 
      (subjects without T2DM) are required to be identified (e.g., via Electronic 
      Health Records (EHR)). However, existing expert based identification algorithms 
      often suffer in a low recall rate and could miss a large number of valuable 
      samples under conservative filtering standards. The goal of this work is to 
      develop a semi-automated framework based on machine learning as a pilot study to 
      liberalize filtering criteria to improve recall rate with a keeping of low false 
      positive rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose a data informed framework for 
      identifying subjects with and without T2DM from EHR via feature engineering and 
      machine learning. We evaluate and contrast the identification performance of 
      widely-used machine learning models within our framework, including 
      k-Nearest-Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector 
      Machine and Logistic Regression. Our framework was conducted on 300 patient 
      samples (161 cases, 60 controls and 79 unconfirmed subjects), randomly selected 
      from 23,281 diabetes related cohort retrieved from a regional distributed EHR 
      repository ranging from 2012 to 2014. RESULTS: We apply top-performing machine 
      learning algorithms on the engineered features. We benchmark and contrast the 
      accuracy, precision, AUC, sensitivity and specificity of classification models 
      against the state-of-the-art expert algorithm for identification of T2DM 
      subjects. Our results indicate that the framework achieved high identification 
      performances (∼0.98 in average AUC), which are much higher than the 
      state-of-the-art algorithm (0.71 in AUC). DISCUSSION: Expert algorithm-based 
      identification of T2DM subjects from EHR is often hampered by the high missing 
      rates due to their conservative selection criteria. Our framework leverages 
      machine learning and feature engineering to loosen such selection criteria to 
      achieve a high identification rate of cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      proposed framework demonstrates a more accurate and efficient approach for 
      identifying subjects with and without T2DM from EHR.

AB  - Obesity is a condition in which excess body fat has accumulated over an extent 
      that increases the risk of many chronic diseases. The current clinical 
      classification of obesity is based on measurement of body mass index (BMI), 
      waist-hip ratio, and body fat percentage. However, these measurements do not 
      account for the wide individual variations in fat distribution, degree of fatness 
      or health risks, and genetic variants identified in the genome-wide association 
      studies (GWAS). In this review, we will address this important issue with the 
      introduction of phenome, phenomics, and phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). 
      We will discuss the new paradigm shift from GWAS to PheWAS in obesity research. 
      In the era of precision medicine, phenomics and PheWAS provide the required 
      approaches to better definition and classification of obesity according to the 
      association of obese phenome with their unique molecular makeup, lifestyle, and 
      environmental impact.

TI  - Genome-wide Regional Heritability Mapping Identifies a Locus Within the TOX2 Gene 
      Associated With Major Depressive Disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the second largest cause of global 
      disease burden. It has an estimated heritability of 37%, but published 
      genome-wide association studies have so far identified few risk loci. 
      Haplotype-block-based regional heritability mapping (HRHM) estimates the 
      localized genetic variance explained by common variants within haplotype blocks, 
      integrating the effects of multiple variants, and may be more powerful for 
      identifying MDD-associated genomic regions. METHODS: We applied HRHM to 
      Generation Scotland: The Scottish Family Health Study, a large family- and 
      population-based Scottish cohort (N = 19,896). Single-single nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) and haplotype-based association tests were used to localize 
      the association signal within the regions identified by HRHM. Functional 
      prediction was used to investigate the effect of MDD-associated SNPs within the 
      regions. RESULTS: A haplotype block across a 24-kb region within the TOX2 gene 
      reached genome-wide significance in HRHM. Single-SNP- and haplotype-based 
      association tests demonstrated that five of nine genotyped SNPs and two 
      haplotypes within this block were significantly associated with MDD. The 
      expression of TOX2 and a brain-specific long noncoding RNA RP1-269M15.3 in 
      frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens basal ganglia, respectively, were 
      significantly regulated by MDD-associated SNPs within this region. Both the 
      regional heritability and single-SNP associations within this block were 
      replicated in the UK-Ireland group of the most recent release of the Psychiatric 
      Genomics Consortium (PGC), the PGC2-MDD (Major Depression Dataset). The SNP 
      association was also replicated in a depressive symptom sample that shares some 
      individuals with the PGC2-MDD. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the value of 
      HRHM for MDD and provides an important target within TOX2 for further functional 
      studies.

TI  - Association of ZFHX3 gene variation with atrial fibrillation, cerebral 
      infarction, and lung thromboembolism: An autopsy study.

AB  - AIM: We aimed to study a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2106261, in the 
      transcription factor gene, ZFHX3, in atrial fibrillation (AF) and other related 
      phenotypes by phenome scanning in a Japanese population. METHOD: We retrieved 
      consecutive autopsy data (n=2433, mean age=80 years) from the Japanese SNP 
      database for geriatric diseases (JG-SNP). Clinical data, including an AF 
      diagnosis, were collected from medical charts. Genotyping was performed with the 
      DNA chip method. We also analyzed 42 pathological and 26 clinical phenotypes, 
      including cerebral infarctions (CIs) and lung thromboembolisms (LTs), diagnosed 
      by macroscopic inspection during the autopsy. RESULT: Among the 2433 patients 
      with available data, 18.6% had AF, 29.4% had CI, and 4.9% had LT phenotypes. The 
      A allele of the rs2106261 SNP was significantly associated with AF, after 
      adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking (AA+AG/GG, OR=1.51, 
      95%CI: 1.16-1.97, p=0.002). In the entire cohort, CI was not associated with 
      rs2106261 (p=0.14). However, among patients under 80 years old, rs2106261 was 
      significantly associated with CI (AA+AG/GG, OR=1.57, 95%CI: 1.09-2.26, p=0.01). 
      LT was also associated with rs2106261 (AA+AG/GG, OR=1.99, 95%CI: 1.31-3.01, 
      p=0.001). Associations between rs2106261 and CI and LT remained positive after 
      adjusting for the presence of AF, which indicated that this SNP variant might 
      serve as an independent risk marker. CONCLUSION: We showed that the ZFHX3 
      polymorphism, rs2106261 (A allele), was a risk marker for AF and AF-related 
      phenotypes. The roles of this variant in the development of AF and its related 
      phenotypes warrant further investigation.

AB  - The capacity to map traits over large cohorts of individuals-phenomics-lags far 
      behind the explosive development in genomics. For microbes, the estimation of 
      growth is the key phenotype because of its link to fitness. We introduce an 
      automated microbial phenomics framework that delivers accurate, precise, and 
      highly resolved growth phenotypes at an unprecedented scale. Advancements were 
      achieved through the introduction of transmissive scanning hardware and software 
      technology, frequent acquisition of exact colony population size measurements, 
      extraction of population growth rates from growth curves, and removal of spatial 
      bias by reference-surface normalization. Our prototype arrangement automatically 
      records and analyzes close to 100,000 growth curves in parallel. We demonstrate 
      the power of the approach by extending and nuancing the known salt-defense 
      biology in baker's yeast. The introduced framework represents a major advance in 
      microbial phenomics by providing high-quality data for extensive cohorts of 
      individuals and generating well-populated and standardized phenomics databases.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ischemia causes myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. 
      Up-regulation of cardiac CLC-3 chloride channels is important for ischemic 
      preconditioning-induced second-window protection against myocardial infarction. 
      But its consequences in ischemia-induced electrical remodeling are still unknown. 
      METHODS: The recently-characterized heart-specific overexpression of human short 
      CLC-3 isoform (hsCLC-3(OE)) mice was used to study the effects of CLC-3 
      up-regulation on cardiac electrophysiology under ischemia/reperfusion conditions. 
      In vivo surface electrocardiography (ECG) and intracardiac electrophysiology 
      (ICEP) were used to compare the electrophysiological properties of age-matched 
      wild-type (Clcn3(+/+)) and hsCLC-3(OE) mice under control and myocardial 
      ischemia-reperfusion conditions. RESULTS: QT and QTc intervals of hsCLC-3(OE) 
      mice were significantly shorter than those of Clcn3(+/+) mice under control, 
      ischemia and reperfusion conditions. In the ICEP, ventricular effective 
      refractory period (VERP) of hsCLC-3(OE) mice (26.7±1.7ms, n=6) was significantly 
      shorter than that of Clcn3(+/+) mice (36.9±2.8ms, n=8, P<0.05). Under ischemia 
      condition, both VERP (19.8±1.3ms) and atrial effective refractory period (AERP, 
      34.8±2.5ms) of hsCLC-3(OE) mice were significantly shorter than those of 
      Clcn3(+/+) mice (35.2±3.0ms and 45.8±1.6ms, P<0.01, respectively). Wenckebach 
      atrioventricular nodal block point (AVBP, 91.13±4.08ms) and 2:1 AVBP (71.3±3.8ms) 
      of hsCLC-3(OE) mice were significantly shorter than those of Clcn3(+/+) mice 
      (102.0±2.0ms and 84.1±2.8ms, P<0.05, respectively). However, no differences of 
      ICEP parameters between hsCLC-3(OE) and Clcn3(+/+) mice were observed under 
      reperfusion conditions. CONCLUSION: Heart-specific overexpression of hsCLC-3 
      limited the ischemia-induced QT and ERP prolongation and postponed the 
      advancements of Wenckebach and 2:1 AVBP. CLC-3 up-regulation may serve as an 
      important adaptive mechanism against myocardial ischemia.

TI  - Systems Medicine Approaches to Improving Understanding, Treatment, and Clinical 
      Management of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.
PG  - 5234-5248
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. More 
      than 200,000 new cases are added each year in the US, translating to a lifetime 
      risk of 1 in 7 men. Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive and 
      treatmentresistant form of prostate cancer. A subset of patients treated with 
      aggressive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) present with NEPC. Patients with 
      NEPC have a reduced 5-year overall survival rate of 12.6%. Knowledge integration 
      from genetic, epigenetic, biochemical and therapeutic studies suggests NEPC as an 
      indicative mechanism of resistance development to various forms of therapy. 
      METHODS: In this perspective, we discuss various experimental, computational and 
      risk prediction methodologies that can be utilized to identify novel therapies 
      against NEPC. We reviewed literature from PubMed and computationally analyzed 
      publicly available genomics data to present different possibilities for 
      developing systems medicine based therapeutic and curative models to understand 
      and target prostate cancer and NEPC. RESULTS: We discuss strategies including 
      gene-set analyses, network analyses, genomics and phenomics aided drug 
      development, microRNA and peptide-based therapeutics, pathway modeling, drug 
      repositioning and cancer immunotherapies. We also discuss the application of 
      cancer risk estimations and mining of electronic medical records to develop 
      personalized risk predictions models for NEPC. Preemptive stratification of 
      patients who are at risk of evolving NEPC phenotypes using predictive models 
      could also help to design and deliver better therapies. CONCLUSION: Collectively, 
      understanding the mechanism of NEPC evolution from prostate cancer using systems 
      biology approaches would help in devising better treatment strategies and is 
      critical and unmet clinical need.

TI  - Heterogeneity of Human Neutrophil CD177 Expression Results from CD177P1 
      Pseudogene Conversion.
PG  - e1006067
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006067 [doi]
LID - e1006067
AB  - Most humans harbor both CD177neg and CD177pos neutrophils but 1-10% of people are 
      CD177null, placing them at risk for formation of anti-neutrophil antibodies that 
      can cause transfusion-related acute lung injury and neonatal alloimmune 
      neutropenia. By deep sequencing the CD177 locus, we catalogued CD177 single 
      nucleotide variants and identified a novel stop codon in CD177null individuals 
      arising from a single base substitution in exon 7. This is not a mutation in 
      CD177 itself, rather the CD177null phenotype arises when exon 7 of CD177 is 
      supplied entirely by the CD177 pseudogene (CD177P1), which appears to have 
      resulted from allelic gene conversion. In CD177 expressing individuals the CD177 
      locus contains both CD177P1 and CD177 sequences. The proportion of CD177hi 
      neutrophils in the blood is a heritable trait. Abundance of CD177hi neutrophils 
      correlates with homozygosity for CD177 reference allele, while heterozygosity for 
      ectopic CD177P1 gene conversion correlates with increased CD177neg neutrophils, 
      in which both CD177P1 partially incorporated allele and paired intact CD177 
      allele are transcribed. Human neutrophil heterogeneity for CD177 expression 
      arises by ectopic allelic conversion. Resolution of the genetic basis of 
      CD177null phenotype identifies a method for screening for individuals at risk of 
      CD177 isoimmunisation.

TI  - Genetic effects on sleep/wake variation of seizures.
PG  - 557-65
LID - 10.1111/epi.13330 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is a complex bidirectional relationship between sleep and 
      epilepsy. Sleep/wake timing of seizures has been investigated for several 
      individual seizure types and syndromes, but few large-scale studies of the timing 
      of seizures exist in people with varied epilepsy types. In addition, the genetic 
      contributions to seizure timing have not been well studied. METHODS: Sleep/wake 
      timing of seizures was determined for 1,395 subjects in 546 families enrolled in 
      the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP). We examined seizure timing among 
      subjects with different epilepsy types, seizure types, epilepsy syndromes, and 
      localization. We also examined the familial aggregation of sleep/wake occurrence 
      of seizures. RESULTS: Seizures in nonacquired focal epilepsy (NAFE) were more 
      likely to occur during sleep than seizures in generalized epilepsy (GE), for both 
      convulsive (odds ratio [OR] 5.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.59-7.52) and 
      nonconvulsive seizures (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.48-7.21). Seizures occurring within 1 h 
      of awakening were more likely to occur in patients with GE than with NAFE for 
      both convulsive (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.54-3.39) and nonconvulsive (OR 1.7, 95% CI 
      1.04-2.66) seizures. Frontal onset seizures were more likely than temporal onset 
      seizures to occur during sleep. Sleep/wake timing of seizures in first-degree 
      relatives predicted timing of seizures in the proband. SIGNIFICANCE: We found 
      that sleep/wake timing of seizures is associated with both epilepsy syndrome and 
      seizure type. In addition, we provide the first evidence for a genetic 
      contribution to sleep/wake timing of seizures in a large group of individuals 
      with common epilepsy syndromes.

TI  - Zebrafish small molecule screens: Taking the phenotypic plunge.
PG  - 350-356
AB  - Target based chemical screens are a mainstay of modern drug discovery, but the 
      effectiveness of this reductionist approach is being questioned in light of 
      declines in pharmaceutical R & D efficiency. In recent years, phenotypic screens 
      have gained increasing acceptance as a complementary/alternative approach to 
      early drug discovery. We discuss the various model organisms used in phenotypic 
      screens, with particular focus on zebrafish, which has emerged as a leading model 
      of in vivo phenotypic screens. Additionally, we anticipate therapeutic 
      opportunities, particularly in orphan disease space, in the context of rapid 
      advances in human Mendelian genetics, electronic health record (EHR)-enabled 
      genome-phenome associations, and genome editing.

TI  - Obtaining T1-T2 distribution functions from 1-dimensional T1 and T2 measurements: 
      The pseudo 2-D relaxation model.

AB  - We present the pseudo 2-D relaxation model (P2DRM), a method to estimate 
      multidimensional probability distributions of material parameters from 
      independent 1-D measurements. We illustrate its use on 1-D T1 and T2 relaxation 
      measurements of saturated rock and evaluate it on both simulated and experimental 
      T1-T2 correlation measurement data sets. Results were in excellent agreement with 
      the actual, known 2-D distribution in the case of the simulated data set. In both 
      the simulated and experimental case, the functional relationships between T1 and 
      T2 were in good agreement with the T1-T2 correlation maps from the 2-D inverse 
      Laplace transform of the full 2-D data sets. When a 1-D CPMG experiment is 
      combined with a rapid T1 measurement, the P2DRM provides a double-shot method for 
      obtaining a T1-T2 relationship, with significantly decreased experimental time in 
      comparison to the full T1-T2 correlation measurement.

TI  - Lack of Genotype and Phenotype Correlation in a Rice T-DNA Tagged Line Is Likely 
      Caused by Introgression in the Seed Source.
PG  - e0155768
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0155768 [doi]
LID - e0155768
AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important crops in the world. Several rice 
      insertional mutant libraries are publicly available for systematic analysis of 
      gene functions. However, the tagging efficiency of these mutant resources-the 
      relationship between genotype and phenotype-is very low. We used whole-genome 
      sequencing to analyze a T-DNA-tagged transformant from the Taiwan Rice 
      Insertional Mutants (TRIM) resource. The phenomics records for M0028590, one of 
      the TRIM lines, revealed three phenotypes-wild type, large grains, and tillering 
      dwarf-in the 12 T1 plants. Using the sequencing data for 7 plants from three 
      generations of this specific line, we demonstrate that introgression from an 
      indica rice variety might occur in one generation before the seed was used for 
      callus generation and transformation of this line. In addition, the large-grain 
      trait came from the GS3 gene of the introgressed region and the tillering dwarf 
      phenotype came from a single nucleotide change in the D17 gene that occurred 
      during the callus induction to regeneration of the transformant. As well, another 
      regenerant showed completely heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms across 
      the whole genome. In addition to the known sequence changes such as T-DNA 
      integration, single nucleotide polymorphism, insertion, deletion, chromosome 
      rearrangement and doubling, spontaneous outcrossing occurred in the rice field 
      may also explain some mutated traits in a tagged mutant population. Thus, the 
      co-segregation of an integration event and the phenotype should be checked when 
      using these mutant populations.

LID - 10464
AB  - Phenome-wide association is a novel reverse genetic strategy to analyze 
      genome-to-phenome relations in human clinical cohorts. Here we test this approach 
      using a large murine population segregating for ∼5 million sequence variants, and 
      we compare our results to those extracted from a matched analysis of gene 
      variants in a large human cohort. For the mouse cohort, we amassed a deep and 
      broad open-access phenome consisting of ∼4,500 metabolic, physiological, 
      pharmacological and behavioural traits, and more than 90 independent expression 
      quantitative trait locus (QTL), transcriptome, proteome, metagenome and 
      metabolome data sets--by far the largest coherent phenome for any experimental 
      cohort (www.genenetwork.org). We tested downstream effects of subsets of variants 
      and discovered several novel associations, including a missense mutation in 
      fumarate hydratase that controls variation in the mitochondrial unfolded protein 
      response in both mouse and Caenorhabditis elegans, and missense mutations in 
      Col6a5 that underlies variation in bone mineral density in both mouse and human.

TI  - Neuropeptide Y mediates glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and marrow adiposity 
      in mice.
PG  - 2777-2789
LID - 10.1007/s00198-016-3598-3 [doi]
AB  - Increased neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression occurred in the glucocorticoid-induced 
      osteoporotic skeleton. NPY knockout mice exhibited a minor response to the 
      glucocorticoid-mediated exacerbation of bone accretion and fatty marrow 
      pathogenesis. NPY deletion restored SITR1 signaling and enhanced PPARγ 
      ubiquitination of bone tissue, an alternative strategy for ameliorating 
      glucocorticoid-induced skeletal deterioration. INTRODUCTION: Glucocorticoid 
      excess is observed to worsen the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and fatty marrow. 
      This study was undertaken to investigate the contribution of neuropeptide Y (NPY) 
      to glucocorticoid-induced bone loss and marrow adiposity. METHODS: NPY knockout 
      and wild-type mice were administered methylprednisolone for four consecutive 
      weeks. Bone mineral density, microarchitecture, and calcein-labeled mineral 
      acquisition were quantified by μCT, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and 
      histomorphometry. Expression of osteogenic and adipogenic markers and acetylation 
      states of PPARγ were detected by RT-quantitative PCR, immunoprecipitation, and 
      immunoblotting. RESULTS: High NPY levels were associated with 
      glucocorticoid-induced trabecular bone deterioration and marrow fat accumulation. 
      Mice lacking NPY had high bone mass concomitant with spacious trabecular and 
      cortical bone microstructure. NPY deletion shielded skeletal tissues from the 
      glucocorticoid-induced impediment of bone mass, trabecular morphometric 
      characteristics, mineral accretion activity, and fatty marrow development. Ex 
      vivo, NPY deficiency sustained osteogenic differentiation capacity and curtailed 
      the glucocorticoid-mediated escalation of adipocyte formation reactions of 
      primary bone-marrow mesenchymal cells. NPY deletion appeared to modulate Y1 and 
      Y2 receptors, sirtuin 1, ERK, and p38 signaling pathways, an effect that 
      facilitated hypoacetylation and ubiquitination of adipogenic transcription factor 
      PPARγ in the skeletal tissues exposed to glucocorticoid stress. CONCLUSIONS: NPY 
      mediates the glucocorticoid-induced disturbance of mineral accretion and marrow 
      adipogenesis through post-translational modification of PPARγ. This study brings 
      a new molecular insight into the disintegration of adipogenic and osteogenic 
      activities within glucocorticoid-mediated osteoporotic skeletons. Control of NPY 
      is an alternative strategy to ameliorate glucocorticoid-induced bone destruction 
      and fatty marrow.

TI  - PHENOME-WIDE INTERACTION STUDY (PheWIS) IN AIDS CLINICAL TRIALS GROUP DATA 
      (ACTG).
PG  - 57-68
AB  - Association studies have shown and continue to show a substantial amount of 
      success in identifying links between multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs) and phenotypes. These studies are also believed to provide insights toward 
      identification of new drug targets and therapies. Albeit of all the success, 
      challenges still remain for applying and prioritizing these associations based on 
      available biological knowledge. Along with single variant association analysis, 
      genetic interactions also play an important role in uncovering the etiology and 
      progression of complex traits. For gene-gene interaction analysis, selection of 
      the variants to test for associations still poses a challenge in identifying 
      epistatic interactions among the large list of variants available in 
      high-throughput, genome-wide datasets. Therefore in this study, we propose a 
      pipeline to identify interactions among genetic variants that are associated with 
      multiple phenotypes by prioritizing previously published results from main effect 
      association analysis (genome-wide and phenome-wide association analysis) based on 
      a-priori biological knowledge in AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) data. We 
      approached the prioritization and filtration of variants by using the results of 
      a previously published single variant PheWAS and then utilizing biological 
      information from the Roadmap Epigenome project. We removed variants in low 
      functional activity regions based on chromatin states annotation and then 
      conducted an exhaustive pairwise interaction search using linear regression 
      analysis. We performed this analysis in two independent pre-treatment clinical 
      trial datasets from ACTG to allow for both discovery and replication. Using a 
      regression framework, we observed 50,798 associations that replicate at p-value 
      0.01 for 26 phenotypes, among which 2,176 associations for 212 unique SNPs for 
      fasting blood glucose phenotype reach Bonferroni significance and an additional 
      9,970 interactions for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) phenotype and fasting blood 
      glucose (total of 12,146 associations) reach FDR significance. We conclude that 
      this method of prioritizing variants to look for epistatic interactions can be 
      used extensively for generating hypotheses for genomewide and phenome-wide 
      interaction analyses. This original Phenome-wide Interaction study (PheWIS) can 
      be applied further to patients enrolled in randomized clinical trials to 
      establish the relationship between patient's response to a particular drug 
      therapy and non-linear combination of variants that might be affecting the 
      outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We explored premature stop-gain variants to test the hypothesis that 
      variants, which are likely to have a consequence on protein structure and 
      function, will reveal important insights with respect to the phenotypes 
      associated with them. We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) 
      exploring the association between a selected list of functional stop-gain genetic 
      variants (variation resulting in truncated proteins or in nonsense-mediated 
      decay) and an extensive group of diagnoses to identify novel associations and 
      uncover potential pleiotropy. RESULTS: In this study, we selected 25 stop-gain 
      variants: 5 stop-gain variants with previously reported phenotypic associations, 
      and a set of 20 putative stop-gain variants identified using dbSNP. For the 
      PheWAS, we used data from the electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) 
      Network across 9 sites with a total of 41,057 unrelated patients. We divided all 
      these samples into two datasets by equal proportion of eMERGE site, sex, race, 
      and genotyping platform. We calculated single effect associations between these 
      25 stop-gain variants and ICD-9 defined case-control diagnoses. We also performed 
      stratified analyses for samples of European and African ancestry. Associations 
      were adjusted for sex, site, genotyping platform and the first three principal 
      components to account for global ancestry. We identified previously known 
      associations, such as variants in LPL associated with hyperglyceridemia 
      indicating that our approach was robust. We also found a total of three 
      significant associations with p < 0.01 in both datasets, with the most 
      significant replicating result being LPL SNP rs328 and ICD-9 code 272.1 "Disorder 
      of Lipoid metabolism" (pdiscovery = 2.59x10-6, preplicating = 2.7x10-4). The 
      other two significant replicated associations identified by this study are: 
      variant rs1137617 in KCNH2 gene associated with ICD-9 code category 244 "Acquired 
      Hypothyroidism" (pdiscovery = 5.31x103, preplicating = 1.15x10-3) and variant 
      rs12060879 in DPT gene associated with ICD-9 code category 996 "Complications 
      peculiar to certain specified procedures" (pdiscovery = 8.65x103, 
      preplicating = 4.16x10-3). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this PheWAS revealed novel 
      associations of stop-gained variants with interesting phenotypes (ICD-9 codes) 
      along with pleiotropic effects.

TI  - Phenome-Wide Association Study to Explore Relationships between Immune System

AB  - We performed a Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) to identify 
      interrelationships between the immune system genetic architecture and a wide 
      array of phenotypes from two de-identified electronic health record (EHR) 
      biorepositories. We selected variants within genes encoding critical factors in 
      the immune system and variants with known associations with autoimmunity. To 
      define case/control status for EHR diagnoses, we used International 
      Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes from 3,024 
      Geisinger Clinic MyCode® subjects (470 diagnoses) and 2,899 Vanderbilt University 
      Medical Center BioVU biorepository subjects (380 diagnoses). A pooled-analysis 
      was also carried out for the replicating results of the two data sets. We 
      identified new associations with potential biological relevance including SNPs in 
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and ankyrin-related genes associated with acute and 
      chronic sinusitis and acute respiratory tract infection. The two most significant 
      associations identified were for the C6orf10 SNP rs6910071 and "rheumatoid 
      arthritis" (ICD-9 code category 714) (pMETAL = 2.58 x 10-9) and the ATN1 SNP 
      rs2239167 and "diabetes mellitus, type 2" (ICD-9 code category 250) (pMETAL = 
      6.39 x 10-9). This study highlights the utility of using PheWAS in conjunction 
      with EHRs to discover new genotypic-phenotypic associations for immune-system 
      related genetic loci.

TI  - INTEGRATING CLINICAL LABORATORY MEASURES AND ICD-9 CODE DIAGNOSES IN PHENOME-WIDE 
      ASSOCIATION STUDIES.
PG  - 168-79
AB  - Electronic health records (EHR) provide a comprehensive resource for discovery, 
      allowing unprecedented exploration of the impact of genetic architecture on 
      health and disease. The data of EHRs also allow for exploration of the complex 
      interactions between health measures across health and disease. The discoveries 
      arising from EHR based research provide important information for the 
      identification of genetic variation for clinical decision-making. Due to the 
      breadth of information collected within the EHR, a challenge for discovery using 
      EHR based data is the development of high-throughput tools that expose important 
      areas of further research, from genetic variants to phenotypes. Phenome-Wide 
      Association studies (PheWAS) provide a way to explore the association between 
      genetic variants and comprehensive phenotypic measurements, generating new 
      hypotheses and also exposing the complex relationships between genetic 
      architecture and outcomes, including pleiotropy. EHR based PheWAS have mainly 
      evaluated associations with case/control status from International Classification 
      of Disease, Ninth Edition (ICD-9) codes. While these studies have highlighted 
      discovery through PheWAS, the rich resource of clinical lab measures collected 
      within the EHR can be better utilized for high-throughput PheWAS analyses and 
      discovery. To better use these resources and enrich PheWAS association results we 
      have developed a sound methodology for extracting a wide range of clinical lab 
      measures from EHR data. We have extracted a first set of 21 clinical lab measures 
      from the de-identified EHR of participants of the Geisinger MyCodeTM 
      biorepository, and calculated the median of these lab measures for 12,039 
      subjects. Next we evaluated the association between these 21 clinical lab median 
      values and 635,525 genetic variants, performing a genome-wide association study 
      (GWAS) for each of 21 clinical lab measures. We then calculated the association 
      between SNPs from these GWAS passing our Bonferroni defined p-value cutoff and 
      165 ICD-9 codes. Through the GWAS we found a series of results replicating known 
      associations, and also some potentially novel associations with less studied 
      clinical lab measures. We found the majority of the PheWAS ICD-9 diagnoses highly 
      related to the clinical lab measures associated with same SNPs. Moving forward, 
      we will be evaluating further phenotypes and expanding the methodology for 
      successful extraction of clinical lab measurements for research and PheWAS use. 
      These developments are important for expanding the PheWAS approach for improved 
      EHR based discovery.

TI  - Ribosomal Stalk Protein Silencing Partially Corrects the ΔF508-CFTR Functional 
      Expression Defect.

AB  - The most common cystic fibrosis (CF) causing mutation, deletion of phenylalanine 
      508 (ΔF508 or Phe508del), results in functional expression defect of the CF 
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) at the apical plasma membrane (PM) of 
      secretory epithelia, which is attributed to the degradation of the misfolded 
      channel at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Deletion of phenylalanine 670 (ΔF670) 
      in the yeast oligomycin resistance 1 gene (YOR1, an ABC transporter) of 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae phenocopies the ΔF508-CFTR folding and trafficking 
      defects. Genome-wide phenotypic (phenomic) analysis of the Yor1-ΔF670 biogenesis 
      identified several modifier genes of mRNA processing and translation, which 
      conferred oligomycin resistance to yeast. Silencing of orthologues of these 
      candidate genes enhanced the ΔF508-CFTR functional expression at the apical PM in 
      human CF bronchial epithelia. Although knockdown of RPL12, a component of the 
      ribosomal stalk, attenuated the translational elongation rate, it increased the 
      folding efficiency as well as the conformational stability of the ΔF508-CFTR, 
      manifesting in 3-fold augmented PM density and function of the mutant. 
      Combination of RPL12 knockdown with the corrector drug, VX-809 (lumacaftor) 
      restored the mutant function to ~50% of the wild-type channel in primary 
      CFTRΔF508/ΔF508 human bronchial epithelia. These results and the observation that 
      silencing of other ribosomal stalk proteins partially rescue the loss-of-function 
      phenotype of ΔF508-CFTR suggest that the ribosomal stalk modulates the folding 
      efficiency of the mutant and is a potential therapeutic target for correction of 
      the ΔF508-CFTR folding defect.

AB  - Aging involves a progressive decline of metabolic function and an increased 
      incidence of late-onset degenerative disorders and cancer. To a large extent, 
      these processes are influenced by alterations affecting the integrity of genome 
      architecture and, ultimately, its phenotypic expression. Despite the progress 
      made towards establishing causal links between genomic and epigenomic changes and 
      aging, mechanisms underlying metabolic dysregulation and age-related phenotypes 
      remain obscure. Here, we present a model linking genome-wide changes and their 
      age-related phenotypic consequences via the alteration of macromolecular 
      complexes and cellular networks. This approach may provide a better understanding 
      of the dynamically changing genome-phenome map with age, but also deeper insights 
      to developing more targeted therapies to prevent and/or manage late-onset 
      degenerative disorders as well as decelerate aging.

TI  - Variations in Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 gene modulate long-term longitudinal 
      differences in cortical thickness in patients with a first-episode of psychosis.
PG  - 629-35
LID - 10.1007/s11682-015-9433-1 [doi]
AB  - Schizophrenia patients typically present a widespread bilateral cortical thinning 
      from the early stages of the illness. However, there is controversy whether this 
      reduction in cortical thickness (CT) is static or progressive over the evolution 
      of the disorder. Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is one of the main 
      candidates genes for schizophrenia, as it has been found associated to the 
      illness, and to several endophenotypes of the disorder including structural brain 
      differences. This gene is known to be involved in neurodevelopment and brain 
      maturation processes. We therefore hypothesized that variations in this gene 
      modulate different progressions of CT in psychosis. Seventy-nine Caucasian 
      drug-naive patients experiencing a first episode of non-affective psychosis were 
      genotyped for rs6675281 (Leu607Phe) and rs821616 (Ser704Cys) SNPs of the DISC1 
      gene. Brain MRIs were carried out at baseline and 3 years after initiating the 
      treatment. Other clinical and socio-demographic variables were recorded to rule 
      out possible confounding effects. Patients homozygous for the Leu allele of the 
      rs6675281 SNP had a significant (p < 0.05) descend in CT over the 3-years period, 
      while those carrying the Phe allele presented an increase in CT. When combining 
      the two SNPs we found a synergic effect on CT progression, presenting those 
      patients homozygous for Leu607 +Ser704 a more pronounced cortical thinning. In 
      conclusion, DISC1 gene variations may modulate the longitudinal changes in 
      cortical thickness in patients suffering from a first episode of non-affective 
      psychosis.

TI  - The effect of elevated CO(2) and virus infection on the primary metabolism of 
      wheat.
PG  - 892-902
LID - 10.1071/FP15242 [doi]
AB  - Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are predicted to double by the end of this 
      century. Although the effects of CO2 fertilisation in crop systems have been well 
      studied, little is known about the specific interactions among plants, pests and 
      pathogens under a changing climate. This growth chamber study focuses on the 
      interactions among Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), its aphid vector 
      (Rhopalosiphum padi) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Yitpi) under ambient 
      (aCO2; 400µmolmol-1) or elevated (eCO2; 650µmolmol-1) CO2 concentrations. eCO2 
      increased the tiller number and biomass of uninoculated plants and advanced the 
      yellowing symptoms of infected plants. Total foliar C content (percentage of the 
      total DW) increased with eCO2 and with sham inoculation (exposed to early 
      herbivory), whereas total N content decreased with eCO2. Liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry approaches were used to quantify the products of 
      primary plant metabolism. eCO2 significantly increased sugars (fructose, mannitol 
      and trehalose), irrespective of disease status, whereas virus infection 
      significantly increased the amino acids essential to aphid diet (histidine, 
      lysine, phenylalanine and tryptophan) irrespective of CO2 concentration. Citric 
      acid was reduced by both eCO2 and virus infection. Both the potential positive 
      and negative biochemical impacts on wheat, aphid and BYDV interactions are 
      discussed.

TI  - Consensus on Recording Deep Endometriosis Surgery: the CORDES statement.
PG  - 1219-23
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dew067 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Which essential items should be recorded before, during and after 
      endometriosis surgery and in clinical outcome based surgical trials in patients 
      with deep endometriosis (DE)? SUMMARY ANSWER: A DE surgical sheet (DESS) was 
      developed for standardized reporting of the surgical treatment of DE and an 
      international expert consensus proposal on relevant items that should be recorded 
      in surgical outcome trials in women with DE. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Surgery is an 
      important treatment for symptomatic DE. So far, data have been reported in such a 
      way that comparison of different surgical techniques is impossible. Therefore, we 
      present an international expert proposal for standardized reporting of surgical 
      treatment and surgical outcome trials in women with DE. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, 
      DURATION: International expert consensus based on a systematic review of 
      literature. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Taking into account 
      recommendations from Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT), the 
      Innovation Development Exploration Assessment and Long-term Study (IDEAL), the 
      Initiative on Methods, Measurement and Pain Assessment in Clinical trials 
      (IMMPACT) and the World Endometriosis Research Foundation Phenome and Biobanking 
      Harmonisation Project (WERF EPHect), a systematic literature review on surgical 
      treatment of DE was performed and resulted in a proposal for standardized 
      reporting, adapted by contributions from eight members of the multidisciplinary 
      Leuven University Hospitals Endometriosis Care Program, from 18 international 
      experts and from audience feedback during three international meetings. MAIN 
      RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We have developed the DESS to record in detail 
      the surgical procedures for DE, and an international consensus on pre-, intra- 
      and post-operative data that should be recorded in surgical outcome trials on DE. 
      LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The recommendations in this paper represent a 
      consensus among international experts based on a systematic review of the 
      literature. For several items and recommendations, high-quality RCTs were not 
      available. Further research is needed to validate and evaluate the 
      recommendations presented here. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This 
      international expert consensus for standardized reporting of surgical treatment 
      in women with DE, based on a systematic literature review and international 
      consensus, can be used as a guideline to record and report surgical management of 
      patients with DE and as a guideline to design, execute, interpret and compare 
      clinical trials in this patient population. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: 
      None of the authors received funding for the development of this paper. M.A.

TI  - The inverse link between genetic risk for schizophrenia and migraine through NMDA 
      (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor activation via D-serine.

AB  - Schizophrenia has a considerable genetic background. Epidemiological studies 
      suggest an inverse clinical association between schizophrenia and migraine. 
      However, it is unclear to what extent this inverse comorbidity can be explained 
      by genetic mechanisms or by schizophrenia-related behavioral factors. For both 
      disorders hypotheses of glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 
      dysfunction have been developed in the past. We hypothesized that both conditions 
      share common genetic factors with inverse effects, primary in the glutamatergic 
      system and genes involved in NMDA activation. Data from the population based 
      Study of Health in Pomerania (N=3973) were used. Based on the results from the 
      recent genome-wide association study for schizophrenia, we calculated polygenic 
      scores (PRS) for subsets of SNPs with different p-value cutoffs and for 
      biological sub-entities. These scores were tested for an association of distinct 
      biological pathways with migraine. The PRS for schizophrenia was inversely 
      associated with migraine in our sample. This association was exclusively based on 
      the genome-wide hits and on single nucleotide polymorphisms near or within genes 
      encoding proteins involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission. This association 
      could be attributed to a single intronic variant rs4523957 in SRR encoding 
      serine-racemase. Additional expression quantitative trait loci analyses of 
      functional variants in SRR and gene-by-gene interaction analyses further 
      supported the validity of this finding. SRR represents the rate limiting enzyme 
      for the synthesis of D-serine, an important co-agonist of the NMDA receptor. 
      According to our results, a decreased versus increased activation of NMDA 
      receptors may play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia, as well as in 
      migraine.

TI  - Disruptive de novo mutations of DYRK1A lead to a syndromic form of autism and ID.
PG  - 126-32
LID - 10.1038/mp.2015.5 [doi]
AB  - Dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1 A (DYRK1A) maps 
      to the Down syndrome critical region; copy number increase of this gene is 
      thought to have a major role in the neurocognitive deficits associated with 
      Trisomy 21. Truncation of DYRK1A in patients with developmental delay (DD) and 
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests a different pathology associated with 
      loss-of-function mutations. To understand the phenotypic spectrum associated with 
      DYRK1A mutations, we resequenced the gene in 7162 ASD/DD patients (2446 
      previously reported) and 2169 unaffected siblings and performed a detailed 
      phenotypic assessment on nine patients. Comparison of our data and published 
      cases with 8696 controls identified a significant enrichment of DYRK1A truncating 
      mutations (P=0.00851) and an excess of de novo mutations (P=2.53 × 10(-10)) among 
      ASD/intellectual disability (ID) patients. Phenotypic comparison of all novel 
      (n=5) and recontacted (n=3) cases with previous case reports, including larger 
      CNV and translocation events (n=7), identified a syndromal disorder among the 15 
      patients. It was characterized by ID, ASD, microcephaly, intrauterine growth 
      retardation, febrile seizures in infancy, impaired speech, stereotypic behavior, 
      hypertonia and a specific facial gestalt. We conclude that mutations in DYRK1A 
      define a syndromic form of ASD and ID with neurodevelopmental defects consistent 
      with murine and Drosophila knockout models.

AB  - Gene co-expression has been widely used to hypothesize gene function through 
      guilt-by association. However, it is not clear to what degree co-expression is 
      informative, whether it can be applied to genes involved in different biological 
      processes, and how the type of dataset impacts inferences about gene functions. 
      Here our goal is to assess the utility and limitations of using co-expression as 
      a criterion to recover functional associations between genes. By determining the 
      percentage of gene pairs in a metabolic pathway with significant expression 
      correlation, we found that many genes in the same pathway do not have similar 
      transcript profiles and the choice of dataset, annotation quality, gene function, 
      expression similarity measure, and clustering approach significantly impacts the 
      ability to recover functional associations between genes using Arabidopsis 
      thaliana as an example. Some datasets are more informative in capturing 
      coordinated expression profiles and larger data sets are not always better. In 
      addition, to recover the maximum number of known pathways and identify candidate 
      genes with similar functions, it is important to explore rather exhaustively 
      multiple dataset combinations, similarity measures, clustering algorithms and 
      parameters. Finally, we validated the biological relevance of co-expression 
      cluster memberships with an independent phenomics dataset and found that genes 
      that consistently cluster with leucine degradation genes tend to have similar 
      leucine levels in mutants. This study provides a framework for obtaining gene 
      functional associations by maximizing the information that can be obtained from 
      gene expression datasets.

AB  - The impact of a single genetic locus on multiple phenotypes, or pleiotropy, is an 
      important area of research. Biological systems are dynamic complex networks, and 
      these networks exist within and between cells. In humans, the consideration of 
      multiple phenotypes such as physiological traits, clinical outcomes and drug 
      response, in the context of genetic variation, can provide ways of developing a 
      more complete understanding of the complex relationships between genetic 
      architecture and how biological systems function in health and disease. In this 
      article, we describe recent studies exploring the relationships between genetic 
      loci and more than one phenotype. We also cover methodological developments 
      incorporating pleiotropy applied to model organisms as well as humans, and 
      discuss how stepping beyond the analysis of a single phenotype leads to a deeper 
      understanding of complex genetic architecture.

TI  - Arrested Hematopoiesis and Vascular Relaxation Defects in Mice with a Mutation in 
      Dhfr.
PG  - 1222-36
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01035-15 [doi]
AB  - Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a critical enzyme in the folate metabolism 
      pathway and also plays a role in regulating nitric oxide (NO) signaling in 
      endothelial cells. Although both coding and noncoding mutations with phenotypic 
      effects have been identified in the human DHFR gene, no mouse model is currently 
      available to study the consequences of perturbing DHFR in vivo In order to 
      identify genes involved in definitive hematopoiesis, we performed a forward 
      genetic screen and produced a mouse line, here referred to as Orana, with a point 
      mutation in the Dhfr locus leading to a Thr136Ala substitution in the DHFR 
      protein. Homozygote Orana mice initiate definitive hematopoiesis, but expansion 
      of progenitors in the fetal liver is compromised, and the animals die between 
      embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) and E14.5. Heterozygote Orana mice survive to 
      adulthood but have tissue-specific alterations in folate abundance and 
      distribution, perturbed stress erythropoiesis, and impaired endothelium-dependent 
      relaxation of the aorta consistent with the role of DHFR in regulating NO 
      signaling. Orana mice provide insight into the dual roles of DHFR and are a 
      useful model for investigating the role of environmental and dietary factors in 
      the context of vascular defects caused by altered NO signaling.

LID - 271
AB  - The neurohormone oxytocin (OXT) has been found to mediate the regulation of 
      complex socioemotional cognition in multiple ways both in humans and other 
      animals. Recent studies have investigated the effects of OXT in different levels 
      of analysis (from genetic to behavioral) chiefly targeting its impact on the 
      social component and only indirectly indicating its implications in other 
      components of our socio-interactive abilities. This article aims at shedding 
      light onto how OXT might be modulating the multimodality that characterizes our 
      higher-order linguistic abilities (vocal-auditory-attentional-memory-social 
      systems). Based on evidence coming from genetic, EEG, fMRI, and behavioral 
      studies, I attempt to establish the promises of this perspective with the goal of 
      stressing the need for neuropeptide treatments to enter clinical practice.

TI  - Characterisation of the metabolome of ocular tissues and post-mortem changes in 
      the rat retina.

AB  - Time-dependent post-mortem biochemical changes have been demonstrated in donor 
      cornea and vitreous, but there have been no published studies to date that 
      objectively measure post-mortem changes in the retinal metabolome over time. The 
      aim of the study was firstly, to investigate post-mortem, time-dependent changes 
      in the rat retinal metabolome and secondly, to compare the metabolite composition 
      of healthy rat ocular tissues. To study post-mortem changes in the rat retinal 
      metabolome, globes were enucleated and stored at 4 °C and sampled at 0, 2, 4, 8, 
      24 and 48 h post-mortem. To study the metabolite composition of rat ocular 
      tissues, eyes were dissected immediately after culling to isolate the cornea, 
      lens, vitreous and retina, prior to storing at -80 °C. Tissue extracts were 
      subjected to Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Ultra High 
      Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). Generally, the 
      metabolic composition of the retina was stable for 8 h post-mortem when eyes were 
      stored at 4 °C, but showed increasing changes thereafter. However, some more 
      rapid changes were observed such as increases in TCA cycle metabolites after 2 h 
      post-mortem, whereas some metabolites such as fatty acids only showed decreases 
      in concentration from 24 h. A total of 42 metabolites were identified across the 
      ocular tissues by GC-MS (MSI level 1) and 2782 metabolites were annotated by 
      UHPLC-MS (MSI level 2) according to MSI reporting standards. Many of the 
      metabolites detected were common to all of the tissues but some metabolites 
      showed partitioning between different ocular structures with 655, 297, 93 and 13 
      metabolites being uniquely detected in the retina, lens, cornea and vitreous 
      respectively. Only a small percentage (1.6%) of metabolites found in the vitreous 
      were only detected in the retina and not other tissues. In conclusion, mass 
      spectrometry-based techniques have been used for the first time to compare the 
      metabolic composition of different ocular tissues. The metabolite composition of 
      the retina stored at 4 °C post-mortem is mostly stable for at least 8 h.

AB  - Identifying variants causal for complex genetic disorders is challenging. With 
      the advent of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, computational tools are 
      needed to explore and analyze the list of variants for further validation. 
      Correlating genetic variants with subject phenotype is crucial for the 
      interpretation of the disease-causing mutations. Often such work is done by teams 
      of researchers who need to share information and coordinate activities. To this 
      end, we have developed a powerful, easy to use Web application, ASPIREdb, which 
      allows researchers to search, organize, analyze, and visualize variants and 
      phenotypes associated with a set of human subjects. Investigators can annotate 
      variants using publicly available reference databases and build powerful queries 
      to identify subjects or variants of interest. Functional information and 
      phenotypic associations of these genes are made accessible as well. Burden 
      analysis and additional reporting tools allow investigation of variant properties 
      and phenotype characteristics. Projects can be shared, allowing researchers to 
      work collaboratively to build queries and annotate the data. We demonstrate 
      ASPIREdb's functionality using publicly available data sets, showing how the 
      software can be used to accomplish goals that might otherwise require specialized 
      bioinformatics expertise. ASPIREdb is available at http://aspiredb.chibi.ubc.ca.

AB  - Salinity represents an abiotic stress constraint affecting growth and 
      productivity of plants in many regions of the world. One of the possible 
      solutions is to improve the level of salt resistance using natural genetic 
      variability within crop species. In the context of recent knowledge on salt 
      stress effects and mechanisms of salt tolerance, this review present useful 
      phenomic approach employing different non-invasive imaging systems for detection 
      of quantitative and qualitative changes caused by salt stress at the plant and 
      canopy level. The focus is put on hyperspectral imaging technique, which provides 
      unique opportunities for fast and reliable estimate of numerous characteristics 
      associated both with various structural, biochemical and physiological traits. 
      The method also provides possibilities to combine plant and canopy analyses with 
      a direct determination of salinity in soil. The future perspectives in salt 
      stress applications as well as some limits of the method are also identified.

AB  - A significant challenge of functional genomics is to develop methods for 
      genome-scale acquisition and analysis of cell biological data. Here, we present 
      an integrated method that combines genome-wide genetic perturbation of 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae with high-content screening to facilitate the genetic 
      description of sub-cellular structures and compartment morphology. As proof of 
      principle, we used a Rad52-GFP marker to examine DNA damage foci in ∼20 million 
      single cells from ∼5,000 different mutant backgrounds in the context of selected 
      genetic or chemical perturbations. Phenotypes were classified using a machine 
      learning-based automated image analysis pipeline. 345 mutants were identified 
      that had elevated numbers of DNA damage foci, almost half of which were 
      identified only in sensitized backgrounds. Subsequent analysis of Vid22, a 
      protein implicated in the DNA damage response, revealed that it acts together 
      with the Sgs1 helicase at sites of DNA damage and preferentially binds 
      G-quadruplex regions of the genome. This approach is extensible to numerous other 
      cell biological markers and experimental systems.

AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate human epiphyseal chondroprogenitor cells 
      (ECPs) as a potential new cell source for cartilage regeneration. ECPs were 
      compared to human bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and human adult articular 
      chondrocytes (ACs) for their chondrogenic potential and phenotypic stability in 
      vitro and in vivo. The cells were seeded in Optimaix-3D scaffolds at 5 × 10(4) 
      cells/mm(3) and gene expression, matrix production and mechanical properties were 
      analysed up to 6 weeks. In vitro, ECPs synthesized consistently high collagen 2 
      and low collagen 10. AC-seeded constructs exhibited high donor variability in 
      GAG/DNA values as well as in collagen 2 staining, but showed low collagen 10 
      production. MSCs, on the other hand, expressed high levels of collagen 2 but also 
      of collagens 1 and 10, and were therefore not considered further. In vivo, there 
      was considerable loss of matrix proteins in ECPs compared to in vitro cultured 
      samples. To overcome this, a second implantation study investigated the effect of 
      mixing cells with alginate prior to seeding in the scaffold. ECPs in alginate 
      maintained their cartilage matrix and resisted mineralization and vessel 
      infiltration better 6 weeks after subcutaneous implantation, whereas ACs lost 
      their chondrogenic matrix completely. This study shows the great potential of 
      ECPs as an off-the-shelf, highly chondrogenic cell type that produces stable 
      cartilage in vivo. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Initiative (HipSci) isf establishing a 
      large catalogue of human iPSC lines, arguably the most well characterized 
      collection to date. The HipSci portal enables researchers to choose the right 
      cell line for their experiment, and makes HipSci's rich catalogue of assay data 
      easy to discover and reuse. Each cell line has genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic 
      and cellular phenotyping data. Data are deposited in the appropriate EMBL-EBI 
      archives, including the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), European 
      Genome-phenome Archive (EGA), ArrayExpress and PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) 
      databases. The project will make 500 cell lines from healthy individuals, and 
      from 150 patients with rare genetic diseases; these will be available through the 
      European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC). As of August 2016, 
      238 cell lines are available for purchase. Project data is presented through the 
      HipSci data portal (http://www.hipsci.org/lines) and is downloadable from the 
      associated FTP site (ftp://ftp.hipsci.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp). The data portal 
      presents a summary matrix of the HipSci cell lines, showing available data types. 
      Each line has its own page containing descriptive metadata, quality information, 
      and links to archived assay data. Analysis results are also available in a Track 
      Hub, allowing visualization in the context of public genomic annotations 
      (http://www.hipsci.org/data/trackhubs).

TI  - [Evolution of genetic diversity and human diseases].
PG  - 852-64
AB  - The problem of development and dispersion of complex diseases in human 
      populations requires new views, approaches, hypotheses, and paradigms. 
      Evolutionary medicine provides one of the promising approaches to this problem, 
      putting the disease into an evolutionary context. Unlike classic approaches 
      oriented to proximate issues on structure and mechanisms of a disease, 
      evolutionary considerations are broader. It provides the basis for understanding 
      the origin, dispersion, and maintenance of the high frequencies of pathological 
      phenotypes in modern human populations. In the current paper, we try to review 
      the modern concepts on the evolution of human genetic diversity, to shape the 
      outlines of evolutionary medicine, and to illustrate evolutionary medical 
      problems using our experimental data. Data on genome-wide search for the signals 
      of decanalization and adaptation in the human genome and on related biological 
      processes and diseases are presented. Some hypotheses and concepts of 
      evolutionary medicine may be productive for revealing the mechanisms of origin 
      and dispersion of complex diseases and for pathogenetics of multifactorial 
      diseases. One of such concepts is the hypothesis of decanalization of 
      genome–phenome relationships under natural selection during modern human 
      dispersion. Probably, the high frequency of alleles associated with complex 
      diseases (and partially the high prevalence of diseases themselves) could be 
      explained in the framework of the hypothesis.

TI  - PhenoScanner: a database of human genotype-phenotype associations.
PG  - 3207-3209
AB  - PhenoScanner is a curated database of publicly available results from large-scale 
      genetic association studies. This tool aims to facilitate 'phenome scans', the 
      cross-referencing of genetic variants with many phenotypes, to help aid 
      understanding of disease pathways and biology. The database currently contains 
      over 350 million association results and over 10 million unique genetic variants, 
      mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms. It is accompanied by a web-based tool 
      that queries the database for associations with user-specified variants, 
      providing results according to the same effect and non-effect alleles for each 
      input variant. The tool provides the option of searching for trait associations 
      with proxies of the input variants, calculated using the European samples from 
      1000 Genomes and Hapmap. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PhenoScanner is 
      available at www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk CONTACT: 
      jrs95@medschl.cam.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary data are 
      available at Bioinformatics online.

TI  - Genetic control of root growth: from genes to networks.
PG  - 9-24
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcv160 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Roots are essential organs for higher plants. They provide the plant 
      with nutrients and water, anchor the plant in the soil, and can serve as energy 
      storage organs. One remarkable feature of roots is that they are able to adjust 
      their growth to changing environments. This adjustment is possible through 
      mechanisms that modulate a diverse set of root traits such as growth rate, 
      diameter, growth direction and lateral root formation. The basis of these traits 
      and their modulation are at the cellular level, where a multitude of genes and 
      gene networks precisely regulate development in time and space and tune it to 
      environmental conditions. SCOPE: This review first describes the root system and 
      then presents fundamental work that has shed light on the basic regulatory 
      principles of root growth and development. It then considers emerging 
      complexities and how they have been addressed using systems-biology approaches, 
      and then describes and argues for a systems-genetics approach. For reasons of 
      simplicity and conciseness, this review is mostly limited to work from the model 
      plant Arabidopsis thaliana, in which much of the research in root growth 
      regulation at the molecular level has been conducted. CONCLUSIONS: While forward 
      genetic approaches have identified key regulators and genetic pathways, 
      systems-biology approaches have been successful in shedding light on complex 
      biological processes, for instance molecular mechanisms involving the 
      quantitative interaction of several molecular components, or the interaction of 
      large numbers of genes. However, there are significant limitations in many of 
      these methods for capturing dynamic processes, as well as relating these 
      processes to genotypic and phenotypic variation. The emerging field of systems 
      genetics promises to overcome some of these limitations by linking genotypes to 
      complex phenotypic and molecular data using approaches from different fields, 
      such as genetics, genomics, systems biology and phenomics.

TI  - Non-destructive Phenotyping of Lettuce Plants in Early Stages of Development with 
      Optical Sensors.
PG  - 1985

AB  - Rapid development of plants is important for the production of 'baby-leaf' 
      lettuce that is harvested when plants reach the four- to eight-leaf stage of 
      growth. However, environmental factors, such as high or low temperature, or 
      elevated concentrations of salt, inhibit lettuce growth. Therefore, 
      non-destructive evaluations of plants can provide valuable information to 
      breeders and growers. The objective of the present study was to test the 
      feasibility of using non-destructive phenotyping with optical sensors for the 
      evaluations of lettuce plants in early stages of development. We performed the 
      series of experiments to determine if hyperspectral imaging and chlorophyll 
      fluorescence imaging can determine phenotypic changes manifested on lettuce 
      plants subjected to the extreme temperature and salinity stress treatments. Our 
      results indicate that top view optical sensors alone can accurately determine 
      plant size to approximately 7 g fresh weight. Hyperspectral imaging analysis was 
      able to detect changes in the total chlorophyll (RCC) and anthocyanin (RAC) 
      content, while chlorophyll fluorescence imaging revealed photoinhibition and 
      reduction of plant growth caused by the extreme growing temperatures (3 and 39°C) 
      and salinity (100 mM NaCl). Though no significant correlation was found between 
      F(v)/F(m) and decrease in plant growth due to stress when comparisons were made 
      across multiple accessions, our results indicate that lettuce plants have a high 
      adaptability to both low (3°C) and high (39°C) temperatures, with no permanent 
      damage to photosynthetic apparatus and fast recovery of plants after moving them 
      to the optimal (21°C) temperature. We have also detected a strong relationship 
      between visual rating of the green- and red-leaf color intensity and RCC and RAC, 
      respectively. Differences in RAC among accessions suggest that the selection for 
      intense red color may be easier to perform at somewhat lower than the optimal 
      temperature. This study serves as a proof of concept that optical sensors can be 
      successfully used as tools for breeders when evaluating young lettuce plants. 
      Moreover, we were able to identify the locus for light green leaf color (qLG4), 
      and position this locus on the molecular linkage map of lettuce, which shows that 
      these techniques have sufficient resolution to be used in a genetic context in 
      lettuce.

TI  - Phenomic Approaches and Tools for Phytopathologists.
PG  - 6-17
AB  - Plant phenomics approaches aim to measure traits such as growth, performance, and 
      composition of plants using a suite of noninvasive technologies. The goal is to 
      link phenotypic traits to the genetic information for particular genotypes, thus 
      creating the bridge between the phenome and genome. Application of sensing 
      technologies for detecting specific phenotypic reactions occurring during 
      plant-pathogen interaction offers new opportunities for elucidating the 
      physiological mechanisms that link pathogen infection and disease symptoms in the 
      host, and also provides a faster approach in the selection of genetic material 
      that is resistant to specific pathogens or strains. Appropriate phenomics methods 
      and tools may also allow presymptomatic detection of disease-related changes in 
      plants or to identify changes that are not visually apparent. This review focuses 
      on the use of sensor-based phenomics tools in plant pathology such as those 
      related to digital imaging, chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, spectral imaging, 
      and thermal imaging. A brief introduction is provided for less used approaches 
      like magnetic resonance, soft x-ray imaging, ultrasound, and detection of 
      volatile compounds. We hope that this concise review will stimulate further 
      development and use of tools for automatic, nondestructive, and high-throughput 
      phenotyping of plant-pathogen interaction.

TI  - A QTL on the short arm of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) chromosome 3B affects the 
      stability of grain weight in plants exposed to a brief heat shock early in grain 
      filling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular markers and knowledge of traits associated with heat 
      tolerance are likely to provide breeders with a more efficient means of selecting 
      wheat varieties able to maintain grain size after heat waves during early grain 
      filling. RESULTS: A population of 144 doubled haploids derived from a cross 
      between the Australian wheat varieties Drysdale and Waagan was mapped using the 
      wheat Illumina iSelect 9,000 feature single nucleotide polymorphism marker array 
      and used to detect quantitative trait loci for heat tolerance of final single 
      grain weight and related traits. Plants were subjected to a 3 d heat treatment 
      (37 °C/27 °C day/night) in a growth chamber at 10 d after anthesis and trait 
      responses calculated by comparison to untreated control plants. A locus for 
      single grain weight stability was detected on the short arm of chromosome 3B in 
      both winter- and autumn-sown experiments, determining up to 2.5 mg difference in 
      heat-induced single grain weight loss. In one of the experiments, a locus with a 
      weaker effect on grain weight stability was detected on chromosome 6B. Among the 
      traits measured, the rate of flag leaf chlorophyll loss over the course of the 
      heat treatment and reduction in shoot weight due to heat were indicators of loci 
      with significant grain weight tolerance effects, with alleles for grain weight 
      stability also conferring stability of chlorophyll ('stay-green') and shoot 
      weight. Chlorophyll loss during the treatment, requiring only two non-destructive 
      readings to be taken, directly before and after a heat event, may prove 
      convenient for identifying heat tolerant germplasm. These results were consistent 
      with grain filling being limited by assimilate supply from the heat-damaged 
      photosynthetic apparatus, or alternatively, accelerated maturation in the grains 
      that was correlated with leaf senescence responses merely due to common genetic 
      control of senescence responses in the two organs. There was no evidence for a 
      role of mobilized stem reserves (water soluble carbohydrates) in determining 
      grain weight responses. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular markers for the 3B or 6B loci, or 
      the facile measurement of chlorophyll loss over the heat treatment, could be used 
      to assist identification of heat tolerant genotypes for breeding.

AB  - Recent advance of bioinformatics and analytical apparatuses such as next 
      generation DNA sequencer (NGS) and mass spectrometer (MS) has brought a big wave 
      of comprehensive study to biology. Comprehensive study targeting all genes, 
      transcripts (RNAs), proteins, metabolites, hormones, ions or phenotypes is called 
      genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, hormonomics, ionomics or 
      phenomics, respectively. These omics are powerful approaches to identify key 
      genes for important traits, to clarify events of physiological mechanisms and to 
      reveal unknown metabolic pathways in crops. Recently, the use of omics approach 
      has increased dramatically in fruit tree research. Although the most reported 
      omics studies on fruit trees are transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, 
      and a few is reported on hormonomics and ionomics. In this article, we reviewed 
      recent omics studies of major fruit trees, i.e. citrus, grapevine and rosaceae 
      fruit trees. The effectiveness and prospects of omics in fruit tree research will 
      as well be highlighted.

AB  - MSeqDR is the Mitochondrial Disease Sequence Data Resource, a centralized and 
      comprehensive genome and phenome bioinformatics resource built by the 
      mitochondrial disease community to facilitate clinical diagnosis and research 
      investigations of individual patient phenotypes, genomes, genes, and variants. A 
      central Web portal (https://mseqdr.org) integrates community knowledge from 
      expert-curated databases with genomic and phenotype data shared by clinicians and 
      researchers. MSeqDR also functions as a centralized application server for 
      Web-based tools to analyze data across both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, 
      including investigator-driven whole exome or genome dataset analyses through 
      MSeqDR-Genesis. MSeqDR-GBrowse genome browser supports interactive genomic data 
      exploration and visualization with custom tracks relevant to mtDNA variation and 
      mitochondrial disease. MSeqDR-LSDB is a locus-specific database that currently 
      manages 178 mitochondrial diseases, 1,363 genes associated with mitochondrial 
      biology or disease, and 3,711 pathogenic variants in those genes. MSeqDR Disease 
      Portal allows hierarchical tree-style disease exploration to evaluate their 
      unique descriptions, phenotypes, and causative variants. Automated genomic data 
      submission tools are provided that capture ClinVar compliant variant annotations. 
      PhenoTips will be used for phenotypic data submission on deidentified patients 
      using human phenotype ontology terminology. The development of a dynamic informed 
      patient consent process to guide data access is underway to realize the full 
      potential of these resources.

TI  - Transcription factor ETV1 is essential for rapid conduction in the heart.
PG  - 4444-4459
LID - 87968 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI87968 [doi]
AB  - Rapid impulse propagation in the heart is a defining property of pectinated 
      atrial myocardium (PAM) and the ventricular conduction system (VCS) and is 
      essential for maintaining normal cardiac rhythm and optimal cardiac output. 
      Conduction defects in these tissues produce a disproportionate burden of 
      arrhythmic disease and are major predictors of mortality in heart failure 
      patients. Despite the clinical importance, little is known about the gene 
      regulatory network that dictates the fast conduction phenotype. Here, we have 
      used signal transduction and transcriptional profiling screens to identify a 
      genetic pathway that converges on the NRG1-responsive transcription factor ETV1 
      as a critical regulator of fast conduction physiology for PAM and VCS 
      cardiomyocytes. Etv1 was highly expressed in murine PAM and VCS cardiomyocytes, 
      where it regulates expression of Nkx2-5, Gja5, and Scn5a, key cardiac genes 
      required for rapid conduction. Mice deficient in Etv1 exhibited marked cardiac 
      conduction defects coupled with developmental abnormalities of the VCS. Loss of 
      Etv1 resulted in a complete disruption of the normal sodium current heterogeneity 
      that exists between atrial, VCS, and ventricular myocytes. Lastly, a phenome-wide 
      association study identified a link between ETV1 and bundle branch block and 
      heart block in humans. Together, these results identify ETV1 as a critical factor 
      in determining fast conduction physiology in the heart.

TI  - IGF-Binding Proteins in Type-1 Diabetes Are More Severely Altered in the Presence 
      of Complications.
PG  - 2
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2016.00002 [doi]
LID - 2
AB  - AIMS: Reduced levels of free and total insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) have 
      been observed in type-1 diabetes (T1D) patients. The bioavailability of IGF-I 
      from the circulation to the target cells is controlled by multifunctional 
      IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). The aim of this study was to profile serum IGFBPs 
      in T1D and its complications. DESIGN: We measured the IGFBP levels in 3662 
      patient serum samples from our ongoing Phenome and Genome of Diabetes 
      Autoimmunity (PAGODA) study. IGFBP levels of four different groups of T1D 
      patients (with 0, 1, 2, and ≥3 complications) were compared with healthy 
      controls. RESULTS: Three serum IGFBPs (IGFBP-1, -2, and -6) are significantly 
      higher in T1D patients, and these alterations are greater in the presence of 
      diabetic complications. IGFBP-3 is lower in patients with diabetic complications. 
      Analyses using quintiles revealed that risk of T1D complications increases with 
      increasing concentrations of IGFBP-2 (fifth quintile ORs: 18-60, p < 10(-26)), 
      IGFBP-1 (fifth quintile ORs: 8-20, p < 10(-15)), and IGFBP-6 (fifth quintile ORs: 
      3-148, p < 10(-3)). IGFBP-3 has a negative association with T1D complications 
      (fifth quintile ORs: 0.12-0.25, p < 10(-5)). CONCLUSION: We found that elevated 
      serum levels of IGFBP-1, -2, and -6 were associated with T1D, and its 
      complications and IGFBP-3 level was found to be decreased in T1D with 
      complications. Given the known role of these IGFBPs, the overall impact of these 
      alterations suggests a negative effect on IGF signaling.

TI  - Massively Parallelized Pollen Tube Guidance and Mechanical Measurements on a

AB  - Pollen tubes are used as a model in the study of plant morphogenesis, cellular 
      differentiation, cell wall biochemistry, biomechanics, and intra- and 
      intercellular signaling. For a "systems-understanding" of the bio-chemo-mechanics 
      of tip-polarized growth in pollen tubes, the need for a versatile, experimental 
      assay platform for quantitative data collection and analysis is critical. We 
      introduce a Lab-on-a-Chip (LoC) concept for high-throughput pollen germination 
      and pollen tube guidance for parallelized optical and mechanical measurements. 
      The LoC localizes a large number of growing pollen tubes on a single plane of 
      focus with unidirectional tip-growth, enabling high-resolution quantitative 
      microscopy. This species-independent LoC platform can be integrated with 
      micro-/nano-indentation systems, such as the cellular force microscope (CFM) or 
      the atomic force microscope (AFM), allowing for rapid measurements of cell wall 
      stiffness of growing tubes. As a demonstrative example, we show the growth and 
      directional guidance of hundreds of lily (Lilium longiflorum) and Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana) pollen tubes on a single LoC microscopy slide. Combining 
      the LoC with the CFM, we characterized the cell wall stiffness of lily pollen 
      tubes. Using the stiffness statistics and finite-element-method (FEM)-based 
      approaches, we computed an effective range of the linear elastic moduli of the 
      cell wall spanning the variability space of physiological parameters including 
      internal turgor, cell wall thickness, and tube diameter. We propose the LoC 
      device as a versatile and high-throughput phenomics platform for plant 
      reproductive and development biology using the pollen tube as a model.

AB  - Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) is frequently used for the analysis and 
      separation of non-polar metabolites, but remains relatively underutilised for the 
      study of polar molecules, even those which pose difficulties with established 
      reversed-phase (RP) or hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographic (HILIC) 
      methodologies. Here, we present a fast SFC-MS method for the analysis of medium 
      and high-polarity (-7≤cLogP≤2) compounds, designed for implementation in a 
      high-throughput metabonomics setting. Sixty polar analytes were first screened to 
      identify those most suitable for inclusion in chromatographic test mixtures; 
      then, a multi-dimensional method development study was conducted to determine the 
      optimal choice of stationary phase, modifier additive and temperature for the 
      separation of such analytes using SFC. The test mixtures were separated on a 
      total of twelve different column chemistries at three different temperatures, 
      using CO2-methanol-based mobile phases containing a variety of polar additives. 
      Chromatographic performance was evaluated with a particular emphasis on peak 
      capacity, overall resolution, peak distribution and repeatability. The results 
      suggest that a new generation of stationary phases, specifically designed for 
      improved robustness in mixed CO2-methanol mobile phases, can improve peak shape, 
      peak capacity and resolution for all classes of polar analytes. A significant 
      enhancement in chromatographic performance was observed for these urinary 
      metabolites on the majority of the stationary phases when polar additives such as 
      ammonium salts (formate, acetate and hydroxide) were included in the organic 
      modifier, and the use of water or alkylamine additives was found to be beneficial 
      for specific subsets of polar analytes. The utility of these findings was 
      confirmed by the separation of a mixture of polar metabolites in human urine 
      using an optimised 7min gradient SFC method, where the use of the recommended 
      column and co-solvent combination resulted in a significant improvement in 
      chromatographic performance.

TI  - Cognitive Machine-Learning Algorithm for Cardiac Imaging: A Pilot Study for 
      Differentiating Constrictive Pericarditis From Restrictive Cardiomyopathy.
LID - 10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.115.004330 [doi]
LID - e004330
AB  - BACKGROUND: Associating a patient's profile with the memories of prototypical 
      patients built through previous repeat clinical experience is a key process in 
      clinical judgment. We hypothesized that a similar process using a cognitive 
      computing tool would be well suited for learning and recalling multidimensional 
      attributes of speckle tracking echocardiography data sets derived from patients 
      with known constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: Clinical and echocardiographic data of 50 patients with constrictive 
      pericarditis and 44 with restrictive cardiomyopathy were used for developing an 
      associative memory classifier-based machine-learning algorithm. The speckle 
      tracking echocardiography data were normalized in reference to 47 controls with 
      no structural heart disease, and the diagnostic area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve of the associative memory classifier was evaluated for 
      differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. Using 
      only speckle tracking echocardiography variables, associative memory classifier 
      achieved a diagnostic area under the curve of 89.2%, which improved to 96.2% with 
      addition of 4 echocardiographic variables. In comparison, the area under the 
      curve of early diastolic mitral annular velocity and left ventricular 
      longitudinal strain were 82.1% and 63.7%, respectively. Furthermore, the 
      associative memory classifier demonstrated greater accuracy and shorter learning 
      curves than other machine-learning approaches, with accuracy asymptotically 
      approaching 90% after a training fraction of 0.3 and remaining flat at higher 
      training fractions. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates feasibility of a 
      cognitive machine-learning approach for learning and recalling patterns observed 
      during echocardiographic evaluations. Incorporation of machine-learning 
      algorithms in cardiac imaging may aid standardized assessments and support the 
      quality of interpretations, particularly for novice readers with limited 
      experience.

TI  - Biological findings from the PheWAS catalog: focus on connective tissue-related 
      disorders (pelvic floor dysfunction, abdominal hernia, varicose veins and 
      hemorrhoids).
PG  - 779-95
LID - 10.1007/s00439-016-1672-8 [doi]
AB  - Pelvic floor dysfunction, specifically genital prolapse (GP) and stress urinary 
      inconsistency (SUI) presumably co-occur with other connective tissue disorders 
      such as hernia, hemorrhoids, and varicose veins. Observations on non-random 
      coexistence of these disorders have never been summarized in a meta-analysis. The 
      performed meta-analysis demonstrated that varicose veins and hernia are 
      associated with GP. Disease connections on the molecular level may be partially 
      based on shared genetic susceptibility. A unique opportunity to estimate shared 
      genetic susceptibility to disorders is provided by a PheWAS (phenome-wide 
      association study) designed to utilize GWAS data concurrently to many phenotypes. 
      We searched the PheWAS Catalog, which includes the results of the PheWAS study 
      with P value < 0.05, for genes associated with GP, SUI, abdominal hernia, 
      varicose veins and hemorrhoids. We found pronounced signals for the associations 
      of the SLC2A9 gene with SUI (P = 6.0e-05) and the MYH9 gene with varicose veins 
      of lower extremity (P = 0.0001) and hemorrhoids (P = 0.0007). The comparison of 
      the PheWAS Catalog and the NHGRI Catalog data revealed enrichment of genes 
      associated with bone mineral density in GP and with activated partial 
      thromboplastin time in varicose veins of lower extremity. In cross-phenotype 
      associations, genes responsible for peripheral nerve functions seem to 
      predominate. This study not only established novel biologically plausible 
      associations that may warrant further studies but also exemplified an effective 
      use of the PheWAS Catalog data.

TI  - Snapshot prediction of carbon productivity, carbon and protein content in a 
      Southern Ocean diatom using FTIR spectroscopy.
PG  - 416-26
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2015.123 [doi]
AB  - Diatoms, an important group of phytoplankton, bloom annually in the Southern 
      Ocean, covering thousands of square kilometers and dominating the region's 
      phytoplankton communities. In their role as the major food source to marine 
      grazers, diatoms supply carbon, nutrients and energy to the Southern Ocean food 
      web. Prevailing environmental conditions influence diatom phenotypic traits (for 
      example, photophysiology, macromolecular composition and morphology), which in 
      turn affect the transfer of energy, carbon and nutrients to grazers and higher 
      trophic levels, as well as oceanic biogeochemical cycles. The paucity of 
      phenotypic data on Southern Ocean phytoplankton limits our understanding of the 
      ecosystem and how it may respond to future environmental change. Here we used a 
      novel approach to create a 'snapshot' of cell phenotype. Using mass spectrometry, 
      we measured nitrogen (a proxy for protein), total carbon and carbon-13 enrichment 
      (carbon productivity), then used this data to build spectroscopy-based predictive 
      models. The models were used to provide phenotypic data for samples from a third 
      sample set. Importantly, this approach enabled the first ever rate determination 
      of carbon productivity from a single time point, circumventing the need for 
      time-series measurements. This study showed that Chaetoceros simplex was less 
      productive and had lower protein and carbon content during short-term periods of 
      high salinity. Applying this new phenomics approach to natural phytoplankton 
      samples could provide valuable insight into understanding phytoplankton 
      productivity and function in the marine system.

      Gene Discovery.

AB  - Monitoring the photosynthetic performance of plants is a major key to 
      understanding how plants adapt to their growth conditions. Stress tolerance 
      traits have a high genetic complexity as plants are constantly, and unavoidably, 
      exposed to numerous stress factors, which limits their growth rates in the 
      natural environment. Arabidopsis thaliana, with its broad genetic diversity and 
      wide climatic range, has been shown to successfully adapt to stressful conditions 
      to ensure the completion of its life cycle. As a result, A. thaliana has become a 
      robust and renowned plant model system for studying natural variation and 
      conducting gene discovery studies. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) in 
      restructured populations combining natural and recombinant lines is a 
      particularly effective way to identify the genetic basis of complex traits. As 
      most abiotic stresses affect photosynthetic activity, chlorophyll fluorescence 
      measurements are a potential phenotyping technique for monitoring plant 
      performance under stress conditions. This review focuses on the use of 
      chlorophyll fluorescence as a tool to study genetic variation underlying the 
      stress tolerance responses to abiotic stress in A. thaliana.

AB  - To provide a useful community resource for orthogonal assessment of NGS analysis 
      software, we present the ICR142 NGS validation series. The dataset includes 
      high-quality exome sequence data from 142 samples together with Sanger sequence 
      data at 704 sites; 416 sites with variants and 288 sites at which variants were 
      called by an NGS analysis tool, but no variant is present in the corresponding 
      Sanger sequence. The dataset includes 293 indel variants and 247 negative indel 
      sites, and thus the ICR142 validation dataset is of particular utility in 
      evaluating indel calling performance. The FASTQ files and Sanger sequence results 
      can be accessed in the European Genome-phenome Archive under the accession number 
      EGAS00001001332.

TI  - Random genetic drift, natural selection, and noise in human cranial evolution.
PG  - 582-92
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.22918 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study assesses the extent to which relationships among groups 
      complicate comparative studies of adaptation in recent human cranial variation 
      and the extent to which departures from neutral additive models of evolution 
      hinder the reconstruction of population relationships among groups using cranial 
      morphology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a maximum likelihood evolutionary model 
      fitting approach and a mixed population genomic and cranial data set, I evaluate 
      the relative fits of several widely used models of human cranial evolution. 
      Moreover, I compare the goodness of fit of models of cranial evolution 
      constrained by genomic variation to test hypotheses about population specific 
      departures from neutrality. RESULTS: Models from population genomics are much 
      better fits to cranial variation than are traditional models from comparative 
      human biology. There is not enough evolutionary information in the cranium to 
      reconstruct much of recent human evolution but the influence of population 
      history on cranial variation is strong enough to cause comparative studies of 
      adaptation serious difficulties. Deviations from a model of random genetic drift 
      along a tree-like population history show the importance of environmental 
      effects, gene flow, and/or natural selection on human cranial variation. 
      Moreover, there is a strong signal of the effect of natural selection or an 
      environmental factor on a group of humans from Siberia. DISCUSSION: The evolution 
      of the human cranium is complex and no one evolutionary process has prevailed at 
      the expense of all others. A holistic unification of phenome, genome, and 
      environmental context, gives us a strong point of purchase on these problems, 
      which is unavailable to any one traditional approach alone. Am J Phys Anthropol

TI  - Aims and structure of the German Research Consortium BipoLife for the study of 
      bipolar disorder.
PG  - 26
LID - 26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is a severe and heterogeneous mental disorder. 
      Despite great advances in neuroscience over the past decades, the precise 
      causative mechanisms at the transmitter, cellular or network level have so far 
      not been unraveled. As a result, individual treatment decisions cannot be 
      tailor-made and the uncertain prognosis is based on clinical characteristics 
      alone. Although a subpopulation of patients have an excellent response to 
      pharmacological monotherapy, other subpopulations have been less well served by 
      the medical system and therefore require more focused attention. In particular 
      individuals at high risk of bipolar disorder, young patients in the early stages 
      of bipolar disorder, patients with an unstable highly relapsing course and 
      patients with acute suicidal ideation have been identified as those in need. 
      STRUCTURE: A research consortium of ten universities across Germany has therefore 
      implemented a 4 year research agenda including three randomized controlled 
      trials, one epidemiological trial and one cross-sectional trial to address these 
      areas of unmet needs. The topics under investigation will be the improvement of 
      early recognition, specific psychotherapy, and smartphones as an aid for early 
      episode detection and biomarkers of lithium response. A subset of patients will 
      be investigated utilizing neuroimaging (fMRI), neurophysiology (EEG), and 
      biomaterials (genomics, transcriptomics). CONCLUSIONS: This article aims to 
      outline the rationale, design, and methods of these individual studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The combination of phenomic data from electronic health records (EHR) 
      and clinical data repositories with dense biological data has enabled genomic and 
      pharmacogenomic discovery, a first step toward precision medicine. Computational 
      methods for the identification of clinical phenotypes from EHR data will advance 
      our understanding of disease risk and drug response, and support the practice of 
      precision medicine on a national scale. METHODS: Based on our experience within 
      three national research networks, we summarize the broad approaches to clinical 
      phenotyping and highlight the important role of these networks in the progression 
      of high-throughput phenotyping and precision medicine. We provide supporting 
      literature in the form of a non-systematic review. RESULTS: The practice of 
      clinical phenotyping is evolving to meet the growing demand for scalable, 
      portable, and data driven methods and tools. The resources required for 
      traditional phenotyping algorithms from expert defined rules are significant. In 
      contrast, machine learning approaches that rely on data patterns will require 
      fewer clinical domain experts and resources. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning 
      approaches that generate phenotype definitions from patient features and clinical 
      profiles will result in truly computational phenotypes, derived from data rather 
      than experts. Research networks and phenotype developers should cooperate to 
      develop methods, collaboration platforms, and data standards that will enable 
      computational phenotyping and truly modernize biomedical research and precision 
      medicine.

TI  - Public Stigma against People with Mental Illness in Jimma Town, Southwest 
      Ethiopia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stigma towards people with mental illness (PWMI) can result in low 
      self-esteem and isolation and threaten employment. Therefore, this study aimed to 
      assess the magnitude of public stigma against PWMI and factors associated with it 
      among Jimma town residents. METHODS: A community-based, cross-sectional, 
      descriptive study was conducted in adult residents of Jimma town. Data were 
      collected among 820 randomly selected residents with the interviewer-administered 
      Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill (CAMI) scale. Linear regression 
      analyses were performed to identify predictors of stigma against PWMI. RESULT: A 
      total of 444 (54%) of the 820 respondents were females, and the mean (SD) age was 
      35 (8.5) years. The minimum and maximum possible values on each CAMI subscale 
      were 10 and 50, respectively. The respondents had high scores for a stigmatizing 
      attitude towards PWMI across all the subscales, as indicated by the mean (SD) 
      scores: authoritarianism, 27.17 (4.96); social restrictiveness, 32.41 (4.20); 
      benevolence, 35.34 (4.42); and community-based mental health ideology, 33.95 
      (5.82). Compared to housewives, private organization employees showed more 
      autocratic and socially restrictive views (std. β = 1.12, P<0.01). Single people 
      had a lower social restrictiveness stigma score than married people (std. β = 
      -0.20, P<0.001), and participants' academic levels correlated inversely with the 
      stigma score (std. β = -0.12, P<0.001). A higher benevolence stigma score was 
      observed among participants with no relationship with PWMI than among those with 
      PWMI in their neighborhood (std. β = 0.08, P< 0.046). CONCLUSION: The study 
      revealed that a negative attitude towards PWMI is widespread. Therefore, there is 
      a need to develop strategies to fight the stigma attached to PWMI at the 
      community level.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing approaches have considerably advanced our 
      understanding of genome function and regulation. However, the knowledge of gene 
      function and complex cellular processes remains a challenge and bottleneck in 
      biological research. Phenomics is a rapidly emerging area, which seeks to 
      rigorously characterize all phenotypes associated with genes or gene variants. 
      Such high-throughput phenotyping under different conditions can be a potent 
      approach toward gene function. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. 
      pombe) is a proven eukaryotic model organism that is increasingly used for 
      genomewide screens and phenomic assays. In this review, we highlight current 
      large-scale, cell-based approaches used with S. pombe, including computational 
      colony-growth measurements, genetic interaction screens, parallel profiling using 
      barcodes, microscopy-based cell profiling, metabolomic methods and transposon 
      mutagenesis. These diverse methods are starting to offer rich insights into the 
      relationship between genotypes and phenotypes.

      Severity in Tomato Plants.

AB  - Pathogen infection in plants induces complex responses ranging from gene 
      expression to metabolic processes in infected plants. In spite of many studies on 
      biotic stress-related changes in host plants, little is known about the metabolic 
      and phenotypic responses of the host plants to Pseudomonas cichorii infection 
      based on image-based analysis. To investigate alterations in tomato plants 
      according to disease severity, we inoculated plants with different cell densities 
      of P. cichorii using dipping and syringe infiltration methods. High-dose inocula 
      (≥ 10(6) cfu/ml) induced evident necrotic lesions within one day that 
      corresponded to bacterial growth in the infected tissues. Among the chlorophyll 
      fluorescence parameters analyzed, changes in quantum yield of PSII (ΦPSII) and 
      non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) preceded the appearance of visible symptoms, 
      but maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) was altered well after symptom 
      development. Visible/near infrared and chlorophyll fluorescence hyperspectral 
      images detected changes before symptom appearance at low-density inoculation. The 
      results of this study indicate that the P. cichorii infection severity can be 
      detected by chlorophyll fluorescence assay and hyperspectral images prior to the 
      onset of visible symptoms, indicating the feasibility of early detection of 
      diseases. However, to detect disease development by hyperspectral imaging, more 
      detailed protocols and analyses are necessary. Taken together, change in 
      chlorophyll fluorescence is a good parameter for early detection of P. cichorii 
      infection in tomato plants. In addition, image-based visualization of infection 
      severity before visual damage appearance will contribute to effective management 
      of plant diseases.

AB  - The functional complexity of human gut microbiota and its relationship with host 
      physiology and environmental modulating factors, offers the opportunity to 
      investigate (i) the host and microbiota role in organism-environment 
      relationship; (ii) the individual functional diversity and response to 
      environmental stimuli (exposome); (iii) the host genome and microbiota 
      metagenomes' modifications by diet-mediated epigenomic controls 
      (nutriepigenomics); and (iv) the genotype-phenotype "trajectories" under 
      physiological and disease constraints. Systems biology-based approaches aim at 
      integrating biological data at cellular, tissue and organ organization levels, 
      using computational modeling to interpret diseases' physiopathological mechanisms 
      (i.e., onset and progression). Proteomics improves the existing gene models by 
      profiling molecular phenotypes at protein abundance level, by analyzing 
      post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions and providing 
      specific pathway information, hence contributing to functional molecular 
      networks. Transcriptomics and metabolomics may determine host ad microbiota 
      changes induced by food ingredients at molecular level, complementing functional 
      genomics and proteomics data. Since foodomics is an -omic wide methodology may 
      feed back all integrative data to foster the omics-based systems medicine field. 
      Hence, coupled to ecological genomics of gut microbial communities, foodomics may 
      highlight health benefits from nutrients, dissecting diet-induced gut microbiota 
      eubiosis mechanisms and significantly contributing to understand and prevent 
      complex disease phenotypes. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Besides transcriptomics and 
      proteomics there is a growing interest in applying metabolic profiling to food 
      science for the development of functional foods. Indeed, one of the biggest 
      challenges of modern nutrition is to propose a healthy diet to populations 
      worldwide, intrinsically respecting the high inter-individual variability, driven 
      by complex host/nutrients/microbiota/environment interactions. Therefore, 
      metabolic profiling can assist at various levels for the development of 
      functional foods, starting from screening for food composition to identification 
      of new biomarkers to trace food intake. This current approach can support diet 
      intervention strategies, epidemiological studies, and controlling of metabolic 
      disorders worldwide spreading, hence ensuring healthy aging. With high-throughput 
      molecular technologies driving foodomics, studying bidirectional interactions of 
      host-microbial co-metabolism, innate immune development, dysfunctional nutrient 
      absorption and processing, complex signaling pathways involved in nutritional 
      metabolism, is now likely. In all cases, as microbiome pipeline efforts continue, 
      it is possible that enhanced standardized protocols can be developed, which may 
      lead to new testable biological and clinical hypotheses. This Review provides a 
      comprehensive update on the current state-of-the-art of the integrated -omics 
      route in food, microbiota and host co-metabolism studies, which may revolutionize 
      the design of new dietary intervention strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic differences in the target proteins, metabolizing enzymes and 
      transporters that contribute to inter-individual differences in drug response are 
      not integrated in contemporary drug development programs. Ayurveda, that has 
      propelled many drug discovery programs albeit for the search of new chemical 
      entities incorporates inter-individual variability "Prakriti" in development and 
      administration of drug in an individualized manner. Prakriti of an individual 
      largely determines responsiveness to external environment including drugs as well 
      as susceptibility to diseases. Prakriti has also been shown to have molecular and 
      genomic correlates. We highlight how integration of Prakriti concepts can augment 
      the efficiency of drug discovery and development programs through a unique 
      initiative of Ayurgenomics TRISUTRA consortium. METHODS: Five aspects that have 
      been carried out are (1) analysis of variability in FDA approved pharmacogenomics 
      genes/SNPs in exomes of 72 healthy individuals including predominant Prakriti 
      types and matched controls from a North Indian Indo-European cohort (2) 
      establishment of a consortium network and development of five genetically 
      homogeneous cohorts from diverse ethnic and geo-climatic background (3) 
      identification of parameters and development of uniform standard protocols for 
      objective assessment of Prakriti types (4) development of protocols for Prakriti 
      evaluation and its application in more than 7500 individuals in the five cohorts 
      (5) Development of data and sample repository and integrative omics pipelines for 
      identification of genomic correlates. RESULTS: Highlight of the study are (1) 
      Exome sequencing revealed significant differences between Prakriti types in 28 
      SNPs of 11 FDA approved genes of pharmacogenomics relevance viz. CYP2C19, CYP2B6, 
      ESR1, F2, PGR, HLA-B, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB1, LDLR, CFTR, CPS1. These variations are 
      polymorphic in diverse Indian and world populations included in 1000 genomes 
      project. (2) Based on the phenotypic attributes of Prakriti we identified 
      anthropometry for anatomical features, biophysical parameters for skin types, HRV 
      for autonomic function tests, spirometry for vital capacity and gustometry for 
      taste thresholds as objective parameters. (3) Comparison of Prakriti phenotypes 
      across different ethnic, age and gender groups led to identification of invariant 
      features as well as some that require weighted considerations across the cohorts. 
      CONCLUSION: Considering the molecular and genomics differences underlying 
      Prakriti and relevance in disease pharmacogenomics studies, this novel 
      integrative platform would help in identification of differently susceptible and 
      drug responsive population. Additionally, integrated analysis of phenomic and 
      genomic variations would not only allow identification of clinical and genomic 
      markers of Prakriti for application in personalized medicine but also its 
      integration in drug discovery and development programs.

TI  - Biomechanisms of Comorbidity: Reviewing Integrative Analyses of Multi-omics 
      Datasets and Electronic Health Records.
PG  - 194-206
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Disease comorbidity is a pervasive phenomenon impacting patients' 
      health outcomes, disease management, and clinical decisions. This review presents 
      past, current and future research directions leveraging both phenotypic and 
      molecular information to uncover disease similarity underpinning the biology and 
      etiology of disease comorbidity. METHODS: We retrieved ~130 publications and 
      retained 59, ranging from 2006 to 2015, that comprise a minimum number of five 
      diseases and at least one type of biomolecule. We surveyed their methods, disease 
      similarity metrics, and calculation of comorbidities in the electronic health 
      records, if present. RESULTS: Among the surveyed studies, 44% generated or 
      validated disease similarity metrics in context of comorbidity, with 60% being 
      published in the last two years. As inputs, 87% of studies utilized intragenic 
      loci and proteins while 13% employed RNA (mRNA, LncRNA or miRNA). Network 
      modeling was predominantly used (35%) followed by statistics (28%) to impute 
      similarity between these biomolecules and diseases. Studies with large numbers of 
      biomolecules and diseases used network models or naïve overlap of 
      disease-molecule associations, while machine learning, statistics, and 
      information retrieval were utilized in smaller and moderate sized studies. 
      Multiscale computations comprising shared function, network topology, and 
      phenotypes were performed exclusively on proteins. CONCLUSION: This review 
      highlighted the growing methods for identifying the molecular mechanisms 
      underpinning comorbidities that leverage multiscale molecular information and 
      patterns from electronic health records. The survey unveiled that intergenic 
      polymorphisms have been overlooked for similarity imputation compared to their 
      intragenic counterparts, offering new opportunities to bridge the mechanistic and 
      similarity gaps of comorbidity.

AB  - The advent of high-throughput technologies has provided exceptional assistance 
      for lung scientists to discover novel genetic variants underlying the development 
      and progression of complex lung diseases. However, the discovered variants thus 
      far do not explain much of the estimated heritability of complex lung diseases. 
      Here, we review the literature of successfully used genome-wide association 
      studies (GWASs) and identified the polymorphisms that reproducibly underpin the 
      susceptibility to various noncancerous complex lung diseases or affect 
      therapeutic responses. We also discuss the inherent limitations of GWAS 
      approaches and how the use of next-generation sequencing technologies has 
      furthered our understanding about the genetic determinants of these diseases. 
      Next, we describe the contribution of the metagenomics to understand the 
      interactions of the airways microbiome with lung diseases. We then highlight the 
      urgent need for new integrative genomics-phenomics methods to more effectively 
      interrogate and understand multiple downstream "omics" (eg, chromatin 
      modification patterns). Finally, we address the scarcity of genetic studies 
      addressing under-represented populations such as African Americans and Hispanics.

TI  - Birth Month and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Association: Is meaningfulness in the 
      eye of the beholder?
PG  - e186
LID - e186
AB  - In the modern era, with high-throughput technology and large data size, 
      associational studies are actively being generated. Some have statistical and 
      clinical validity and utility, or at least have biologically plausible 
      relationships, while others may not. Recently, the potential effect of birth 
      month on lifetime disease risks has been studied in a phenome-wide model. We 
      evaluated the associations between birth month and 5 cardiovascular 
      disease-related outcomes in an independent registry of 8,346 patients from 
      Ontario, Canada in 1977-2014. We used descriptive statistics and logistic 
      regression, along with model-fit and discrimination statistics. Hypertension and 
      coronary heart disease (of primary interest) were most prevalent in those who 
      were born in January and April, respectively, as observed in the previous study. 
      Other outcomes showed weak or opposite associations. Ancillary analyses (based on 
      raw blood pressures and subgroup analyses by sex) demonstrated inconsistent 
      patterns and high randomness. Our study was based on a high risk population and 
      could not provide scientific explanations. As scientific values and clinical 
      implications can be different, readers are encouraged to read the original and 
      our papers together for more objective interpretations of the potential impact of 
      birth month on individual and public health as well as toward cumulative/total 
      evidence in general.

TI  - Phenome-Wide Association Study for Alcohol and Nicotine Risk Alleles in 26394 
      Women.
PG  - 2688-96
LID - 10.1038/npp.2016.72 [doi]
AB  - To identify novel traits associated with alleles known to predispose to alcohol 
      and nicotine use, we conducted a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) in a 
      large multi-population cohort. We investigated 7688 African-Americans, 1133 
      Asian-Americans, 14 081 European-Americans, and 3492 Hispanic-Americans from the 
      Women's Health Initiative, analyzing alleles at the CHRNA3-CHRNA5 locus, ADH1B, 
      and ALDH2 with respect to phenotypic traits related to anthropometric 
      characteristics, dietary habits, social status, psychological traits, 
      reproductive history, health conditions, and nicotine/alcohol use. In ADH1B 
      trans-population meta-analysis and population-specific analysis, we replicated 
      prior associations with drinking behaviors and identified multiple novel 
      phenome-wide significant and suggestive findings related to psychological traits, 
      socioeconomic status, vascular/metabolic conditions, and reproductive health. We 
      then applied Bayesian network learning algorithms to provide insight into the 
      causative relationships of the novel ADH1B associations: ADH1B appears to affect 
      phenotypic traits via both alcohol-mediated and alcohol-independent effects. In 
      an independent sample of 2379 subjects, we also replicated the novel ADH1B 
      associations related to socioeconomic status (household gross income and highest 
      grade finished in school). For CHRNA3-CHRNA5 risk alleles, we replicated 
      association with smoking behaviors, lung cancer, and asthma. There were also 
      novel suggestive CHRNA3-CHRNA5 findings with respect to 
      high-cholesterol-medication use and distrustful attitude. In conclusion, the 
      genetics of alcohol and tobacco use potentially has broader implications on 
      physical and mental health than is currently recognized. In particular, ADH1B may 
      be a gene relevant for the human phenome via both alcohol metabolism-related 
      mechanisms and other alcohol metabolism-independent mechanisms.

TI  - Nitrogen assimilation system in maize is regulated by developmental and 
      tissue-specific mechanisms.
PG  - 293-312
LID - 10.1007/s11103-016-0512-5 [doi]
AB  - We found metabolites, enzyme activities and enzyme transcript abundances vary 
      significantly across the maize lifecycle, but weak correlation exists between the 
      three groups. We identified putative genes regulating nitrate assimilation. 
      Progress in improving nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) of crop plants has been 
      hampered by the complexity of the N uptake and utilisation systems. To understand 
      this complexity we measured the activities of seven enzymes and ten metabolites 
      related to N metabolism in the leaf and root tissues of Gaspe Flint maize plants 
      grown in 0.5 or 2.5 mM NO3 (-) throughout the lifecycle. The amino acids had 
      remarkably similar profiles across the lifecycle except for transient responses, 
      which only appeared in the leaves for aspartate or in the roots for asparagine, 
      serine and glycine. The activities of the enzymes for N assimilation were also 
      coordinated to a certain degree, most noticeably with a peak in root activity 
      late in the lifecycle, but with wide variation in the activity levels over the 
      course of development. We analysed the transcriptional data for gene sets 
      encoding the measured enzymes and found that, unlike the enzyme activities, 
      transcript levels of the corresponding genes did not exhibit the same 
      coordination across the lifecycle and were only weakly correlated with the levels 
      of various amino acids or individual enzyme activities. We identified gene sets 
      which were correlated with the enzyme activity profiles, including seven genes 
      located within previously known quantitative trait loci for enzyme activities and 
      hypothesise that these genes are important for the regulation of enzyme 
      activities. This work provides insights into the complexity of the N assimilation 
      system throughout development and identifies candidate regulatory genes, which 
      warrant further investigation in efforts to improve NUE in crop plants.

TI  - RASopathies: Presentation at the Genome, Interactome, and Phenome Levels.
PG  - 72-9
LID - 10.1159/000445733 [doi]
AB  - Clinical symptoms often reflect molecular correlations between mutated proteins. 
      Alignment between interactome and phenome levels reveals new disease genes and 
      connections between previously unrelated diseases. Despite a great potential for 
      novel discoveries, this approach is still rarely used in genomics. In the present 
      study, we analyzed the data of 6 syndromes belonging to the RASopathy class of 
      disorders (RASopathies) and presented them as a model to study associations 
      between genome, interactome, and phenome levels. Causative genes and clinical 
      symptoms were collected from OMIM and NCBI GeneReviews databases for 6 syndromes: 
      Noonan, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, neurofibromatosis type 1, 
      cardiofaciocutaneous, and Legius and Costello syndrome. The STRING tool was used 
      for the identification of protein interactions. Six RASopathy syndromes were 
      found to be associated with 12 causative genes. We constructed an interactome of 
      RASopathy proteins and their neighbors and developed a database of 328 clinical 
      symptoms. The collected data was presented at genome, interactome, and phenome 
      levels and as an integrated network of all 3 data types. The present study 
      provides a baseline for future studies of associations between interactome and 
      phenome in RASopathies and could serve as a novel approach to analyze 
      phenotypically and genetically related diseases.

TI  - Novel approach to automatically classify rat social behavior using a video 
      tracking system.
PG  - 163-70
LID - S0165-0270(16)30001-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2016.02.020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past, studies in behavioral neuroscience and drug development 
      have relied on simple and quick readout parameters of animal behavior to assess 
      treatment efficacy or to understand underlying brain mechanisms. The predominant 
      use of classical behavioral tests has been repeatedly criticized during the last 
      decades because of their poor reproducibility, poor translational value and the 
      limited explanatory power in functional terms. NEW METHOD: We present a new 
      method to monitor social behavior of rats using automated video tracking. The 
      velocity of moving and the distance between two rats were plotted in frequency 
      distributions. In addition, behavior was manually annotated and related to the 
      automatically obtained parameters for a validated interpretation. RESULTS: 
      Inter-individual distance in combination with velocity of movement provided 
      specific behavioral classes, such as moving with high velocity when "in contact" 
      or "in proximity". Human observations showed that these classes coincide with 
      following (chasing) behavior. In addition, when animals are "in contact", but at 
      low velocity, behaviors such as allogrooming and social investigation were 
      observed. Also, low dose treatment with morphine and short isolation increased 
      the time animals spent in contact or in proximity at high velocity. COMPARISON 
      WITH EXISTING METHODS: Current methods that involve the investigation of social 
      rat behavior are mostly limited to short and relatively simple manual 
      observations. CONCLUSION: A new and automated method for analyzing social 
      behavior in a social interaction test is presented here and shows to be sensitive 
      to drug treatment and housing conditions known to influence social behavior in 
      rats.

AB  - The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a population 
      survey implemented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to 
      monitor the health of the United States whose data is publicly available in 
      hundreds of files. This Data Descriptor describes a single unified and 
      universally accessible data file, merging across 255 separate files and stitching 
      data across 4 surveys, encompassing 41,474 individuals and 1,191 variables. The 
      variables consist of phenotype and environmental exposure information on each 
      individual, specifically (1) demographic information, physical exam results 
      (e.g., height, body mass index), laboratory results (e.g., cholesterol, glucose, 
      and environmental exposures), and (4) questionnaire items. Second, the data 
      descriptor describes a dictionary to enable analysts find variables by category 
      and human-readable description. The datasets are available on DataDryad and a 
      hands-on analytics tutorial is available on GitHub. Through a new big data 
      platform, BD2K Patient Centered Information Commons (http://pic-sure.org), we 
      provide a new way to browse the dataset via a web browser 
      (https://nhanes.hms.harvard.edu) and provide application programming interface 
      for programmatic access.

AB  - Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is a rare but life-threatening 
      disease characterized by severe intestinal dysmotility. Histopathologic studies 
      in CIPO patients have identified several different mechanisms that appear to be 
      involved in the dysmotility, including defects in neurons, smooth muscle, or 
      interstitial cells of Cajal. Currently there are few mouse models of the various 
      forms of CIPO. We generated a mouse with a point mutation in the RNA recognition 
      motif of the Nup35 gene, which encodes a component of the nuclear pore complex. 
      Nup35 mutants developed a severe megacolon and exhibited a reduced lifespan. 
      Histopathologic examination revealed a degenerative myopathy that developed after 
      birth and specifically affected smooth muscle in the colon; smooth muscle in the 
      small bowel and the bladder were not affected. Furthermore, no defects were found 
      in enteric neurons or interstitial cells of Cajal. Nup35 mice are likely to be a 
      valuable model for the subtype of CIPO characterized by degenerative myopathy. 
      Our study also raises the possibility that Nup35 polymorphisms could contribute 
      to some cases of CIPO.

AB  - PURPOSE: Capturing organ-specific phenomes in genetic diseases is an uphill task 
      for the eye as it comprises tissue types derived from all three germinal layers. 
      We attempted to deconstruct genetic eye diseases (GEDs) into primary phenotypic 
      features, to understand the complex genome-phenome relationship in GEDs. METHODS: 
      Using phenotype, molecular basis, and gene description features in OMIM as a 
      primary resource, we analyzed gene-phenotype information. All ocular and systemic 
      phenotypes were categorized and ranked based on occurrence. Clustering was 
      performed on shared ocular features to identify genetic interactions and the 
      largest cluster of each phenotype was used for functional analyses. RESULTS: We 
      collected 527 GEDs associated with 440 unique protein-coding genes. We indexed 
      787 ocular and 3094 systemic features, for an average of 2.17 ocular and 8.14 
      systemic features, respectively, per disease unit. The most common ocular 
      features included nystagmus, hypertelorism, and myopia, while neurological and 
      skeletal are the most common systemic groups associated with GEDs. Functional 
      analyses revealed pathways relevant to GEDs (e.g., extracellular matrix 
      organization in ONH3 [glaucoma]) and protein metabolism in EOM35 (nystagmus) 
      phenotype clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Our work imparts a structure in dissecting GEDs 
      into unique phenotypes to study the relationship between genes and diseases 
      involving the eye.

TI  - Increased Surface Area, but not Cortical Thickness, in a Subset of Young Boys 
      With Autism Spectrum Disorder.
PG  - 232-48
LID - 10.1002/aur.1520 [doi]
AB  - The Autism Phenome Project is the largest, single site, longitudinal magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) study of young children with autism spectrum disorder 
      (ASD). Previous analyses from this cohort have shown that the children with 
      autism have a total brain volume at time 1 (∼3 years of age) that is 6% larger 
      than typically developing (TD) children. This finding is driven primarily by 15% 
      of the boys with ASD that have disproportionate megalencephaly (ASD-DM) or brain 
      size that is 1.5 standard deviations above what would be expected for the child's 
      height. In the current study, cerebral cortical grey matter volume, thickness, 
      and surface area were assayed from MRI scans of 112, 3-year-old boys with ASD and 
      50 age-matched TD boys. The boys with ASD-DM (n = 17) were analyzed separately 
      from the boys with normal brain size (ASD-N, n = 95). Previous studies of 
      cortical thickness and surface area for ASD children in this age range have come 
      to diametrically different conclusions concerning the significance of cortical 
      thickness vs. surface area. Current analyses indicate that cortical thickness was 
      comparable across the ASD and TD groups. However, surface area was significantly 
      greater in the ASD group compared to the TD group. This result was driven largely 
      by the children with ASD-DM. Even in the ASD-DM group, not all cortical regions 
      demonstrated increased surface area. These results provide strong evidence that 
      the early cortical overgrowth associated with ASD is due primarily to increased 
      surface area and not to increased cortical thickness.

PG  - 853-66
LID - 10.2217/pgs-2015-0007 [doi]
AB  - AIM: We sought to identify potential pleiotropy involving pharmacogenes. METHODS: 
      We tested 184 functional variants in 34 pharmacogenes for associations using a 
      custom grouping of International Classification and Disease, Ninth Revision 
      billing codes extracted from deidentified electronic health records of 6892 
      patients. RESULTS: We replicated several associations including ABCG2 (rs2231142) 
      and gout (p = 1.73 × 10(-7); odds ratio [OR]: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.40-2.12); and 
      SLCO1B1 (rs4149056) and jaundice (p = 2.50 × 10(-4); OR: 1.67; 95% CI: 
      1.27-2.20). CONCLUSION: In this systematic screen for phenotypic associations 
      with functional variants, several novel genotype-phenotype combinations also 
      achieved phenome-wide significance, including SLC15A2 rs1143672 and renal 
      osteodystrophy (p = 2.67 × 10(-) (6); OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49-0.75).

TI  - The digital revolution in phenotyping.
PG  - 819-30
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbv083 [doi]
AB  - Phenotypes have gained increased notoriety in the clinical and biological domain 
      owing to their application in numerous areas such as the discovery of disease 
      genes and drug targets, phylogenetics and pharmacogenomics. Phenotypes, defined 
      as observable characteristics of organisms, can be seen as one of the bridges 
      that lead to a translation of experimental findings into clinical applications 
      and thereby support 'bench to bedside' efforts. However, to build this 
      translational bridge, a common and universal understanding of phenotypes is 
      required that goes beyond domain-specific definitions. To achieve this ambitious 
      goal, a digital revolution is ongoing that enables the encoding of data in 
      computer-readable formats and the data storage in specialized repositories, ready 
      for integration, enabling translational research. While phenome research is an 
      ongoing endeavor, the true potential hidden in the currently available data still 
      needs to be unlocked, offering exciting opportunities for the forthcoming years. 
      Here, we provide insights into the state-of-the-art in digital phenotyping, by 
      means of representing, acquiring and analyzing phenotype data. In addition, we 
      provide visions of this field for future research work that could enable better 
      applications of phenotype data.

TI  - Methods for acquiring MRI data in children with autism spectrum disorder and 
      intellectual impairment without the use of sedation.
PG  - 20
LID - 10.1186/s11689-016-9154-9 [doi]
LID - 20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used in studies 
      evaluating the neuropathology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies are 
      often limited, however, to higher functioning individuals with ASD. MRI studies 
      of individuals with ASD and comorbid intellectual disability (ID) are lacking, 
      due in part to the challenges of acquiring images without the use of sedation. 
      METHODS: Utilizing principles of applied behavior analysis (ABA), we developed a 
      protocol for acquiring structural MRI scans in school-aged children with ASD and 
      intellectual impairment. Board certified behavior analysts worked closely with 
      each child and their parent(s), utilizing behavior change techniques such as 
      pairing, shaping, desensitization, and positive reinforcement, through a series 
      of mock scanner visits to prepare the child for the MRI scan. An objective, 
      quantitative assessment of motion artifact in T1- and diffusion-weighted scans 
      was implemented to ensure that high-quality images were acquired. RESULTS: The 
      sample consisted of 17 children with ASD who are participants in the UC Davis 
      Autism Phenome Project, a longitudinal MRI study aimed at evaluating brain 
      developmental trajectories from early to middle childhood. At the time of their 
      initial scan (2-3.5 years), all 17 children had a diagnosis of ASD and 
      development quotient (DQ) <70. At the time of the current scan (9-13 years), 13 
      participants continued to have IQs in the range of ID (mean IQ = 54.1, 
      sd = 12.1), and four participants had IQs in the normal range (mean = 102.2, 
      sd = 7.5). The success rate in acquiring T1-weighted images that met quality 
      assurance for acceptable motion artifact was 100 %. The success rate for 
      acquiring high-quality diffusion-weighted images was 94 %. CONCLUSIONS: By using 
      principles of ABA in a research MRI setting, it is feasible to acquire 
      high-quality images in school-aged children with ASD and intellectual impairment 
      without the use of sedation. This is especially critical to ensure that ongoing 
      longitudinal studies of brain development can extend from infancy and early 
      childhood into middle childhood in children with ASD at all levels of 
      functioning, including those with comorbid ID.

TI  - Pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenases enable redox balance of Pseudomonas putida 
      during biodegradation of aromatic compounds.
PG  - 3565-3582
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.13434 [doi]
AB  - The metabolic versatility of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida is reflected 
      by its ability to execute strong redox reactions (e.g., mono- and 
      di-oxygenations) on aromatic substrates. Biodegradation of aromatics occurs via 
      the pathway encoded in the archetypal TOL plasmid pWW0, yet the effect of running 
      such oxidative route on redox balance against the background metabolism of P. 
      putida remains unexplored. To answer this question, the activity of pyridine 
      nucleotide transhydrogenases (that catalyze the reversible interconversion of 
      NADH and NADPH) was inspected under various physiological and oxidative stress 
      regimes. The genome of P. putida KT2440 encodes a soluble transhydrogenase (SthA) 
      and a membrane-bound, proton-pumping counterpart (PntAB). Mutant strains, lacking 
      sthA and/or pntAB, were subjected to a panoply of genetic, biochemical, phenomic 
      and functional assays in cells grown on customary carbon sources (e.g., citrate) 
      versus difficult-to-degrade aromatic substrates. The results consistently 
      indicated that redox homeostasis is compromised in the 
      transhydrogenases-defective variant, rendering the mutant sensitive to oxidants. 
      This metabolic deficiency was, however, counteracted by an increase in the 
      activity of NADP(+) -dependent dehydrogenases in central carbon metabolism. Taken 
      together, these observations demonstrate that transhydrogenases enable a 
      redox-adjusting mechanism that comes into play when biodegradation reactions are 
      executed to metabolize unusual carbon compounds.

AB  - Phenomics is a technology-driven approach with promising future to obtain 
      unbiased data of biological systems. Image acquisition is relatively simple. 
      However data handling and analysis are not as developed compared to the sampling 
      capacities. We present a system based on machine learning (ML) algorithms and 
      computer vision intended to solve the automatic phenotype data analysis in plant 
      material. We developed a growth-chamber able to accommodate species of various 
      sizes. Night image acquisition requires near infrared lightning. For the ML 
      process, we tested three different algorithms: k-nearest neighbour (kNN), Naive 
      Bayes Classifier (NBC), and Support Vector Machine. Each ML algorithm was 
      executed with different kernel functions and they were trained with raw data and 
      two types of data normalisation. Different metrics were computed to determine the 
      optimal configuration of the machine learning algorithms. We obtained a 
      performance of 99.31% in kNN for RGB images and a 99.34% in SVM for NIR. Our 
      results show that ML techniques can speed up phenomic data analysis. Furthermore, 
      both RGB and NIR images can be segmented successfully but may require different 
      ML algorithms for segmentation.

AB  - Remote sensing describes the characterization of the status of objects and/or the 
      classification of their identity based on a combination of spectral features 
      extracted from reflectance or transmission profiles of radiometric energy. Remote 
      sensing can be benchtop based, and therefore acquired at a high spatial 
      resolution, or airborne at lower spatial resolution to cover large areas. Despite 
      important challenges, airborne remote sensing technologies will undoubtedly be of 
      major importance in optimized management of agricultural systems in the 
      twenty-first century. Benchtop remote sensing applications are becoming important 
      in insect systematics and in phenomics studies of insect behavior and physiology. 
      This review highlights how remote sensing influences entomological research by 
      enabling scientists to nondestructively monitor how individual insects respond to 
      treatments and ambient conditions. Furthermore, novel remote sensing technologies 
      are creating intriguing interdisciplinary bridges between entomology and 
      disciplines such as informatics and electrical engineering.

TI  - Resources and Recommendations for Using Transcriptomics to Address Grand 
      Challenges in Comparative Biology.
PG  - 1183-1191
AB  - High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has become an important tool 
      for studying physiological responses of organisms to changes in their 
      environment. De novo assembly of RNA-seq data has allowed researchers to create a 
      comprehensive catalog of genes expressed in a tissue and to quantify their 
      expression without a complete genome sequence. The contributions from the 
      "Tapping the Power of Crustacean Transcriptomics to Address Grand Challenges in 
      Comparative Biology" symposium in this issue show the successes and limitations 
      of using RNA-seq in the study of crustaceans. In conjunction with the symposium, 
      the Animal Genome to Phenome Research Coordination Network collated comments from 
      participants at the meeting regarding the challenges encountered when using 
      transcriptomics in their research. Input came from novices and experts ranging 
      from graduate students to principal investigators. Many were unaware of the 
      bioinformatics analysis resources currently available on the CyVerse platform. 
      Our analysis of community responses led to three recommendations for advancing 
      the field: (1) integration of genomic and RNA-seq sequence assemblies for 
      crustacean gene annotation and comparative expression; (2) development of 
      methodologies for the functional analysis of genes; and (3) information and 
      training exchange among laboratories for transmission of best practices. The 
      field lacks the methods for manipulating tissue-specific gene expression. The 
      decapod crustacean research community should consider the cherry shrimp, 
      Neocaridina denticulata, as a decapod model for the application of transgenic 
      tools for functional genomics. This would require a multi-investigator effort.

TI  - Ascribing Functions to Genes: Journey Towards Genetic Improvement of Rice Via 
      Functional Genomics.
PG  - 155-76

AB  - Rice, one of the most important cereal crops for mankind, feeds more than half 
      the world population. Rice has been heralded as a model cereal owing to its small 
      genome size, amenability to easy transformation, high synteny to other cereal 
      crops and availability of complete genome sequence. Moreover, sequence wealth in 
      rice is getting more refined and precise due to resequencing efforts. This 
      humungous resource of sequence data has confronted research fraternity with a 
      herculean challenge as well as an excellent opportunity to functionally validate 
      expressed as well as regulatory portions of the genome. This will not only help 
      us in understanding the genetic basis of plant architecture and physiology but 
      would also steer us towards developing improved cultivars. No single technique 
      can achieve such a mammoth task. Functional genomics through its diverse tools 
      viz. loss and gain of function mutants, multifarious omics strategies like 
      transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and phenomics provide us with the 
      necessary handle. A paradigm shift in technological advances in functional 
      genomics strategies has been instrumental in generating considerable amount of 
      information w.r.t functionality of rice genome. We now have several databases and 
      online resources for functionally validated genes but despite that we are far 
      from reaching the desired milestone of functionally characterizing each and every 
      rice gene. There is an urgent need for a common platform, for information already 
      available in rice, and collaborative efforts between researchers in a concerted 
      manner as well as healthy public-private partnership, for genetic improvement of 
      rice crop better able to handle the pressures of climate change and exponentially 
      increasing population.

PG  - 11433

LID - 11433
AB  - We hypothesized that generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), which estimate the 
      additive genetic variance underlying phenotype variability, would facilitate 
      rapid characterization of clinical phenotypes from an electronic health record. 
      We evaluated 1,288 phenotypes in 29,349 subjects of European ancestry with 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping on the Illumina Exome Beadchip. 
      We show that genetic liability estimates are primarily driven by SNPs identified 
      by prior genome-wide association studies and SNPs within the human leukocyte 
      antigen (HLA) region. We identify 44 (false discovery rate q<0.05) phenotypes 
      associated with HLA SNP variation and show that hypothyroidism is genetically 
      correlated with Type I diabetes (rG=0.31, s.e. 0.12, P=0.003). We also report 
      novel SNP associations for hypothyroidism near HLA-DQA1/HLA-DQB1 at rs6906021 
      (combined odds ratio (OR)=1.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-1.2), P=9.8 × 
      10(-11)) and for polymyalgia rheumatica near C6orf10 at rs6910071 (OR=1.5 (95% 
      CI: 1.3-1.6), P=1.3 × 10(-10)). Phenome-wide application of GLMMs identifies 
      phenotypes with important genetic drivers, and focusing on these phenotypes can 
      identify novel genetic associations.

AB  - A plant phenotyping approach was applied to evaluate growth rate of containerized 
      tree seedlings during the precultivation phase following seed germination. A 
      simple and affordable stereo optical system was used to collect stereoscopic 
      red-green-blue (RGB) images of seedlings at regular intervals of time. 
      Comparative analysis of these images by means of a newly developed software 
      enabled us to calculate (a) the increments of seedlings height and (b) the 
      percentage greenness of seedling leaves. Comparison of these parameters with 
      destructive biomass measurements showed that the height traits can be used to 
      estimate seedling growth for needle-leaved plant species whereas the greenness 
      trait can be used for broad-leaved plant species. Despite the need to adjust for 
      plant type, growth stage and light conditions this new, cheap, rapid, and 
      sustainable phenotyping approach can be used to study large-scale phenome 
      variations due to genome variability and interaction with environmental factors.

AB  - Escherichia coli strains are widely used in academic research and biotechnology. 
      New technologies for quantifying strain-specific differences and their underlying 
      contributing factors promise greater understanding of how these differences 
      significantly impact physiology, synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and 
      process design. Here, we quantified strain-specific differences in seven widely 
      used strains of E. coli (BL21, C, Crooks, DH5a, K-12 MG1655, K-12 W3110, and W) 
      using genomics, phenomics, transcriptomics, and genome-scale modeling. Metabolic 
      physiology and gene expression varied widely with downstream implications for 
      productivity, product yield, and titer. These differences could be linked to 
      differential regulatory structure. Analyzing high-flux reactions and expression 
      of encoding genes resulted in a correlated and quantitative link between these 
      sets, with strain-specific caveats. Integrated modeling revealed that certain 
      strains are better suited to produce given compounds or express desired 
      constructs considering native expression states of pathways that enable 
      high-production phenotypes. This study yields a framework for quantitatively 
      comparing strains in a species with implications for strain selection.

AB  - Domestication of tomato has resulted in large diversity in fruit phenotypes. An 
      intensive phenotyping of 127 tomato accessions from 20 countries revealed 
      extensive morphological diversity in fruit traits. The diversity in fruit traits 
      clustered the accessions into nine classes and identified certain promising lines 
      having desirable traits pertaining to total soluble salts (TSS), carotenoids, 
      ripening index, weight and shape. Factor analysis of the morphometric data from 
      Tomato Analyzer showed that the fruit shape is a complex trait shared by several 
      factors. The 100% variance between round and flat fruit shapes was explained by 
      one discriminant function having a canonical correlation of 0.874 by stepwise 
      discriminant analysis. A set of 10 genes (ACS2, COP1, CYC-B, RIN, MSH2, NAC-NOR, 
      PHOT1, PHYA, PHYB and PSY1) involved in various plant developmental processes 
      were screened for SNP polymorphism by EcoTILLING. The genetic diversity in these 
      genes revealed a total of 36 non-synonymous and 18 synonymous changes leading to 
      the identification of 28 haplotypes. The average frequency of polymorphism across 
      the genes was 0.038/Kb. Significant negative Tajima'D statistic in two of the 
      genes, ACS2 and PHOT1 indicated the presence of rare alleles in low frequency. 
      Our study indicates that while there is low polymorphic diversity in the genes 
      regulating plant development, the population shows wider phenotype diversity. 
      Nonetheless, morphological and genetic diversity of the present collection can be 
      further exploited as potential resources in future.

TI  - A phenome-wide association study of a lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 
      loss-of-function variant in 90 000 Chinese adults.
PG  - 1588-1599
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)) has been 
      implicated in development of atherosclerosis; however, recent randomized trials 
      of Lp-PLA(2) inhibition reported no beneficial effects on vascular diseases. In 
      East Asians, a loss-of-function variant in the PLA2G7 gene can be used to assess 
      the effects of genetically determined lower Lp-PLA(2) METHODS: PLA2G7 V279F 
      (rs76863441) was genotyped in 91 428 individuals randomly selected from the China 
      Kadoorie Biobank of 0.5 M participants recruited in 2004-08 from 10 regions of 
      China, with 7 years' follow-up. Linear regression was used to assess effects of 
      V279F on baseline traits. Logistic regression was conducted for a range of 
      vascular and non-vascular diseases, including 41 ICD-10 coded disease categories. 
      RESULTS: PLA2G7 V279F frequency was 5% overall (range 3-7% by region), and 9691 
      (11%) participants had at least one loss-of-function variant. V279F was not 
      associated with baseline blood pressure, adiposity, blood glucose or lung 
      function. V279F was not associated with major vascular events [7141 events; odds 
      ratio (OR) = 0.98 per F variant, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-1.06] or other 
      vascular outcomes, including major coronary events (922 events; 0.96, 0.79-1.18) 
      and stroke (5967 events; 1.00, 0.92-1.09). Individuals with V279F had lower risks 
      of diabetes (7031 events; 0.91, 0.84-0.98) and asthma (182 events; 0.53, 
      0.28-0.98), but there was no association after adjustment for multiple testing. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Lifelong lower Lp-PLA(2) activity was not associated with major 
      risks of vascular or non-vascular diseases in Chinese adults. Using functional 
      genetic variants in large-scale prospective studies with linkage to a range of 
      health outcomes is a valuable approach to inform drug development and 
      repositioning.

TI  - Quantitative Trait Loci for Yield and Yield-Related Traits in Spring Barley 
      Populations Derived from Crosses between European and Syrian Cultivars.

AB  - In response to climatic changes, breeding programmes should be aimed at creating 
      new cultivars with improved resistance to water scarcity. The objective of this 
      study was to examine the yield potential of barley recombinant inbred lines 
      (RILs) derived from three cross-combinations of European and Syrian spring 
      cultivars, and to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for yield-related 
      traits in these populations. RILs were evaluated in field experiments over a 
      period of three years (2011 to 2013) and genotyped with simple sequence repeat 
      (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers; a genetic map for each 
      population was constructed and then one consensus map was developed. Biological 
      interpretation of identified QTLs was achieved by reference to Ensembl Plants 
      barley gene space. Twelve regions in the genomes of studied RILs were 
      distinguished after QTL analysis. Most of the QTLs were identified on the 2H 
      chromosome, which was the hotspot region in all three populations. Syrian 
      parental cultivars contributed alleles decreasing traits' values at majority of 
      QTLs for grain weight, grain number, spike length and time to heading, and 
      numerous alleles increasing stem length. The phenomic and molecular approaches 
      distinguished the lines with an acceptable grain yield potential combining 
      desirable features or alleles from their parents, that is, early heading from the 
      Syrian breeding line (Cam/B1/CI08887//CI05761) and short plant stature from the 
      European semidwarf cultivar (Maresi).

TI  - Genome to Phenome Mapping in Apple Using Historical Data.
LID - 10.3835/plantgenome2015.11.0113 [doi]
AB  - Apple ( X Borkh.) is one of the world's most valuable fruit crops. Its large size 
      and long juvenile phase make it a particularly promising candidate for 
      marker-assisted selection (MAS). However, advances in MAS in apple have been 
      limited by a lack of phenotype and genotype data from sufficiently large samples. 
      To establish genotype-phenotype relationships and advance MAS in apple, we 
      extracted over 24,000 phenotype scores from the USDA-Germplasm Resources 
      Information Network (GRIN) database and linked them with over 8000 single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 689 apple accessions from the USDA apple 
      germplasm collection clonally preserved in Geneva, NY. We find significant 
      genetic differentiation between Old World and New World cultivars and demonstrate 
      that the genetic structure of the domesticated apple also reflects the time 
      required for ripening. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 36 phenotypes 
      confirms the association between fruit color and the MYB1 locus, and we also 
      report a novel association between the transcription factor, NAC18.1, and harvest 
      date and fruit firmness. We demonstrate that harvest time and fruit size can be 
      predicted with relatively high accuracies ( > 0.46) using genomic prediction. 
      Rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in apples means millions of SNPs may 
      be required for well-powered GWAS. However, rapid LD decay also promises to 
      enable extremely high resolution mapping of causal variants, which holds great 
      potential for advancing MAS.

TI  - $1 DNA barcodes for reconstructing complex phenomes and finding rare species in 
      specimen-rich samples.
PG  - 100-110
LID - 10.1111/cla.12115 [doi]
AB  - Several of the biggest challenges in taxonomy and systematics are related to a 
      toxic mixture of small size, abundance, and rarity. There are too many species in 
      groups with too few taxonomists and many of these species are very rare and hard 
      to find because they are hidden in mass samples. To make matters worse, these 
      species often have life-history stages that are morphologically so different that 
      it is difficult to identify them as semaphoronts of the same species. We 
      demonstrate that these biodiversity challenges can be addressed with 
      cost-effective molecular markers. Here, we describe a next-generation-sequencing 
      protocol that can yield barcodes at a chemical cost of < 0.40 USD per specimen. 
      We use this protocol to generate molecular markers for 1015 specimens of tropical 
      midges (Diptera: Chironomidae). The barcodes cluster into 52-61 molecular 
      operational taxonomic units (OTUs) depending on whether Objective Clustering 
      (OC), Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC), or Poisson Tree Process (PTP) is 
      used. More than half of the putative species are rare (< 10 specimens) and we are 
      able to match larvae and adults for 24 of these OTUs. We argue that the proposed 
      protocol will help with processing specimen-rich biodiversity samples at low 
      cost.

TI  - Diurnal Solar Energy Conversion and Photoprotection in Rice Canopies.
PG  - 495-508
LID - 10.1104/pp.16.01585 [doi]
AB  - Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing 
      the efficiency with which solar radiation is converted into biomass has recently 
      become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude 
      modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level 
      monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light conversion and 
      photoprotection in natural environments, potentially over the entire crop 
      lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) 
      and irradiance was measured in five cultivars of rice (Oryza sativa) in canopy 
      conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar radiation. This relationship 
      differed substantially from that observed for conventional short term light 
      response curves measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. 
      This difference was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve 
      fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of 
      photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under 
      canopy solar radiation was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. 
      Genotypic variation in the irradiance at which energy flux into photoprotective 
      dissipation became greater than ETR was observed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR 
      at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, 
      estimated by noninvasive imaging.

AB  - Systems-wide molecular phenomics is rapidly expanding through technological 
      advances in instrumentation and bioinformatics. Strategies such as structural 
      mass spectrometry, which utilizes size and shape measurements with molecular 
      weight, serve to characterize the sum of molecular expression in biological 
      contexts, where broad-scale measurements are made that are interpreted through 
      big data statistical techniques to reveal underlying patterns corresponding to 
      phenotype. The data density, data dimensionality, data projection, and data 
      interrogation are all critical aspects of these approaches to turn data into 
      salient information. Untargeted molecular phenomics is already having a dramatic 
      impact in discovery science from drug discovery to synthetic biology. It is 
      evident that these emerging techniques will integrate closely in broad efforts 
      aimed at precision medicine.

TI  - A developing Setaria viridis internode: an experimental system for the study of 
      biomass generation in a C4 model species.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1186/s13068-016-0457-6 [doi]
LID - 45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, there has been interest in establishing a monocot C4 model 
      species with a small genome, short lifecycle, and capacity for genetic 
      transformation. Setaria viridis has been adopted to fill this role, since reports 
      of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in 2010, and sequencing of its genome in 
      2012. To date, S. viridis has primarily been used to further our understanding of 
      C4 photosynthesis, but is also an ideal system for the study of biomass crops, 
      which are almost exclusively C4 panicoid grasses. Biogenesis of stem tissue, its 
      cell wall composition, and soluble sugar content are important determinants of 
      bioenergy crop yields. Here we show that a developing S. viridis internode is a 
      valuable experimental system for gene discovery in relation to these important 
      bioenergy feedstock traits. RESULTS: The rate of maximal stem biomass 
      accumulation in S. viridis A10 under long day growth was at the half-head 
      emergence developmental stage. At this stage of development, internode 5 (of 7) 
      was found to be rapidly expanding with an active meristem, a zone of cell 
      expansion (primary cell walls), a transitional zone where cell expansion ceased 
      and secondary cell wall deposition was initiated, and a mature zone that was 
      actively accumulating soluble sugars. A simple method for identifying these zones 
      was established allowing rapid dissection and snap-freezing for RNAseq analysis. 
      A transcriptome profile was generated for each zone showing a transition from 
      cell division and nucleic acid synthesis/processing in the meristem, to 
      metabolism, energy synthesis, and primary cell wall synthesis in the cell 
      expansion zone, to secondary cell wall synthesis in the transitional zone, to 
      sugar transport, and photosynthesis in the mature zone. CONCLUSION: The 
      identification of these zones has provided a valuable experimental system for 
      investigating key bioenergy traits, including meristematic activity, cell wall 
      biosynthesis, and soluble sugar accumulation, in a C4 panicoid grass that has 
      genetic resources, a short life cycle, and small stature allowing controlled 
      experimental conditions in growth cabinets. Here we have presented a 
      comprehensive map of gene expression and metabolites in this experimental system 
      to facilitate gene discovery and controlled hypothesis testing for bioenergy 
      research in S. viridis.

AB  - In spite of decades of linkage and association studies and its potential impact 
      on human health, reliable prediction of an individual's risk for heritable 
      disease remains difficult. Large numbers of mapped loci do not explain 
      substantial fractions of heritable variation, leaving an open question of whether 
      accurate complex trait predictions can be achieved in practice. Here, we use a 
      genome sequenced population of ∼7,000 yeast strains of high but varying 
      relatedness, and predict growth traits from family information, effects of 
      segregating genetic variants and growth in other environments with an average 
      coefficient of determination R(2) of 0.91. This accuracy exceeds narrow-sense 
      heritability, approaches limits imposed by measurement repeatability and is 
      higher than achieved with a single assay in the laboratory. Our results prove 
      that very accurate prediction of complex traits is possible, and suggest that 
      additional data from families rather than reference cohorts may be more useful 
      for this purpose.

      functions (Pavlov I.P., 1950), the theory offunctional systems (Anokhin P.K., 
      1973), the theory of adaptive reactions (Selye H., 1960 ; Garkavi LKh et al,

      (Baevsky R.M.), doctrine on the body type of the human by Merlin VS. conception 
      on the “the interrelationship between the function and genetic apparatus” by 
      Meyerson F.Z., Pshennikova M.G., Platonov V.N., and others, there is proposed to 
      select phenomics - functional division of genetics considering the poolability of 
      specific mechanisms of the body in an integral system of the adaptive act in 
      favor of the development of a personalized approach to the diagnosis and 
      prevention of non-communicable diseases, increasing life expectancy of working 
      age into the particular scientific direction. The task of phenomics is the 
      establishment of the phenotypic characteristics of the person, norms of the 
      response of systems of his body, determination of the deviation of the level of 
      the functioning of the each system from the norm of its response and the 
      elaboration of the tactics for the correction of the functional state of the 
      organism (the optimization of its life activity), with taking into account the 
      directedness of the interaction of body systems. The description of the shaping 
      of the mechanism of stereotyped response of the organism generated an important 
      contribution to the development of phenomics. Stereotyped response being 
      initiated by the non-specific response of the body is aimed at the shaping of the 
      activity of its systems after a fashion of norms of the activity, promotes the 
      recovery of the specificity of the body, plays an important role in the 
      establishment of cause-effect relations of the disease.

TI  - Microbial phenomics information extractor (MicroPIE): a natural language 
      processing tool for the automated acquisition of prokaryotic phenotypic 
      characters from text sources.
PG  - 528
LID - 528
AB  - BACKGROUND: The large-scale analysis of phenomic data (i.e., full phenotypic 
      traits of an organism, such as shape, metabolic substrates, and growth 
      conditions) in microbial bioinformatics has been hampered by the lack of tools to 
      rapidly and accurately extract phenotypic data from existing legacy text in the 
      field of microbiology. To quickly obtain knowledge on the distribution and 
      evolution of microbial traits, an information extraction system needed to be 
      developed to extract phenotypic characters from large numbers of taxonomic 
      descriptions so they can be used as input to existing phylogenetic analysis 
      software packages. RESULTS: We report the development and evaluation of Microbial 
      Phenomics Information Extractor (MicroPIE, version 0.1.0). MicroPIE is a natural 
      language processing application that uses a robust supervised classification 
      algorithm (Support Vector Machine) to identify characters from sentences in 
      prokaryotic taxonomic descriptions, followed by a combination of algorithms 
      applying linguistic rules with groups of known terms to extract characters as 
      well as character states. The input to MicroPIE is a set of taxonomic 
      descriptions (clean text). The output is a taxon-by-character matrix-with taxa in 
      the rows and a set of 42 pre-defined characters (e.g., optimum growth 
      temperature) in the columns. The performance of MicroPIE was evaluated against a 
      gold standard matrix and another student-made matrix. Results show that, compared 
      to the gold standard, MicroPIE extracted 21 characters (50%) with a Relaxed F1 
      score > 0.80 and 16 characters (38%) with Relaxed F1 scores ranging between 0.50 
      and 0.80. Inclusion of a character prediction component (SVM) improved the 
      overall performance of MicroPIE, notably the precision. Evaluated against the 
      same gold standard, MicroPIE performed significantly better than the 
      undergraduate students. CONCLUSION: MicroPIE is a promising new tool for the 
      rapid and efficient extraction of phenotypic character information from 
      prokaryotic taxonomic descriptions. However, further development, including 
      incorporation of ontologies, will be necessary to improve the performance of the 
      extraction for some character types.

TI  - Determining Which Phenotypes Underlie a Pleiotropic Signal.
PG  - 366-81
LID - 10.1002/gepi.21973 [doi]
AB  - Discovering pleiotropic loci is important to understand the biological basis of 
      seemingly distinct phenotypes. Most methods for assessing pleiotropy only test 
      for the overall association between genetic variants and multiple phenotypes. To 
      determine which specific traits are pleiotropic, we evaluate via simulation and 
      application three different strategies. The first is model selection techniques 
      based on the inverse regression of genotype on phenotypes. The second is a 
      subset-based meta analysis ASSET [Bhattacharjee et al., ], which provides an 
      optimal subset of nonnull traits. And the third is a modified Benjamini-Hochberg 
      (B-H) procedure of controlling the expected false discovery rate [Benjamini and 
      Hochberg, ] in the framework of phenome-wide association study. From our 
      simulations we see that an inverse regression-based approach MultiPhen [O'Reilly 
      et al., ] is more powerful than ASSET for detecting overall pleiotropic 
      association, except for when all the phenotypes are associated and have genetic 
      effects in the same direction. For determining which specific traits are 
      pleiotropic, the modified B-H procedure performs consistently better than the 
      other two methods. The inverse regression-based selection methods perform 
      competitively with the modified B-H procedure only when the phenotypes are weakly 
      correlated. The efficiency of ASSET is observed to lie below and in between the 
      efficiency of the other two methods when the traits are weakly and strongly 
      correlated, respectively. In our application to a large GWAS, we find that the 
      modified B-H procedure also performs well, indicating that this may be an optimal 
      approach for determining the traits underlying a pleiotropic signal.

TI  - Maternal urinary metabolic signatures of fetal growth and associated clinical and 
      environmental factors in the INMA study.
PG  - 177
LID - 177
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal metabolism during pregnancy is a major determinant of the 
      intra-uterine environment and fetal outcomes. Herein, we characterize the 
      maternal urinary metabolome throughout pregnancy to identify maternal metabolic 
      signatures of fetal growth in two subcohorts and explain potential sources of 
      variation in metabolic profiles based on lifestyle and clinical data. METHODS: We 
      used (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize maternal 
      urine samples collected in the INMA birth cohort at the first (n = 412 and 
      n = 394, respectively, in Gipuzkoa and Sabadell cohorts) and third trimesters of 
      gestation (n = 417 and 469). Metabolic phenotypes that reflected longitudinal 
      intra- and inter-individual variation were used to predict measures of fetal 
      growth and birth weight. RESULTS: A metabolic shift between the first and third 
      trimesters of gestation was characterized by (1)H NMR signals arising 
      predominantly from steroid by-products. We identified 10 significant and 
      reproducible metabolic associations in the third trimester with estimated fetal, 
      birth, and placental weight in two independent subcohorts. These included 
      branched-chain amino acids; isoleucine, valine, leucine, alanine and 3 
      hydroxyisobutyrate (metabolite of valine), which were associated with a 
      significant fetal weight increase at week 34 of up to 2.4 % in Gipuzkoa 
      (P < 0.005) and 1 % in Sabadell (P < 0.05). Other metabolites included 
      pregnancy-related hormone by-products of estrogens and progesterone, and the 
      methyl donor choline. We could explain a total of 48-53 % of the total variance 
      in birth weight of which urine metabolites had an independent predictive power of 
      12 % adjusting for all other lifestyle/clinical factors. First trimester 
      metabolic phenotypes could not predict reproducibly weight at later stages of 
      development. Physical activity, as well as other modifiable lifestyle/clinical 
      factors, such as coffee consumption, vitamin D intake, and smoking, were 
      identified as potential sources of metabolic variation during pregnancy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Significant reproducible maternal urinary metabolic signatures of 
      fetal growth and birth weight are identified for the first time and linked to 
      modifiable lifestyle factors. This novel approach to prenatal screening, 
      combining multiple risk factors, present a great opportunity to personalize 
      pregnancy management and reduce newborn disease risk in later life.

AB  - Insect phylogenetics is being profoundly changed by many innovations. Although 
      rapid developments in genomics have center stage, key progress has been made in 
      phenomics, field and museum science, digital databases and pipelines, analytical 
      tools, and the culture of science. The importance of these methodological and 
      cultural changes to the pace of inference of the hexapod Tree of Life is 
      discussed. The innovations have the potential, when synthesized and mobilized in 
      ways as yet unforeseen, to shine light on the million or more clades in insects, 
      and infer their composition with confidence. There are many challenges to 
      overcome before insects can enter the 'phylocognisant age', but because of the 
      promise of genomics, phenomics, and informatics, that is now an imaginable 
      future.

TI  - Genetic resources offer efficient tools for rice functional genomics research.
PG  - 998-1013
LID - 10.1111/pce.12632 [doi]
AB  - Rice is an important crop and major model plant for monocot functional genomics 
      studies. With the establishment of various genetic resources for rice genomics, 
      the next challenge is to systematically assign functions to predicted genes in 
      the rice genome. Compared with the robustness of genome sequencing and 
      bioinformatics techniques, progress in understanding the function of rice genes 
      has lagged, hampering the utilization of rice genes for cereal crop improvement. 
      The use of transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutagenesis offers the advantage of 
      uniform distribution throughout the rice genome, but preferentially in gene-rich 
      regions, resulting in direct gene knockout or activation of genes within 20-30 kb 
      up- and downstream of the T-DNA insertion site and high gene tagging efficiency. 
      Here, we summarize the recent progress in functional genomics using the 
      T-DNA-tagged rice mutant population. We also discuss important features of T-DNA 
      activation- and knockout-tagging and promoter-trapping of the rice genome in 
      relation to mutant and candidate gene characterizations and how to more 
      efficiently utilize rice mutant populations and datasets for high-throughput 
      functional genomics and phenomics studies by forward and reverse genetics 
      approaches. These studies may facilitate the translation of rice functional 
      genomics research to improvements of rice and other cereal crops.

TI  - Toward the integration of Omics data in epidemiological studies: still a "long 
      and winding road".
PG  - 558-569
LID - 10.1002/gepi.21992 [doi]
AB  - Primary and secondary prevention can highly benefit a personalized medicine 
      approach through the accurate discrimination of individuals at high risk of 
      developing a specific disease from those at moderate and low risk. To this end 
      precise risk prediction models need to be built. This endeavor requires a precise 
      characterization of the individual exposome, genome, and phenome. Massive 
      molecular omics data representing the different layers of the biological 
      processes of the host and the nonhost will enable to build more accurate risk 
      prediction models. Epidemiologists aim to integrate omics data along with 
      important information coming from other sources (questionnaires, candidate 
      markers) that has been proved to be relevant in the discrimination risk 
      assessment of complex diseases. However, the integrative models in large-scale 
      epidemiologic research are still in their infancy and they face numerous 
      challenges, some of them at the analytical stage. So far, there are a small 
      number of studies that have integrated more than two omics data sets, and the 
      inclusion of non-omics data in the same models is still missing in most of 
      studies. In this contribution, we aim at approaching the omics and non-omics data 
      integration from the epidemiology scope by considering the "massive" inclusion of 
      variables in the risk assessment and predictive models. We also provide already 
      available examples of integrative contributions in the field, propose analytical 
      strategies that allow considering both omics and non-omics data in the models, 
      and finally review the challenges imbedding this type of research.

TI  - Spectral Knowledge (SK-UTALCA): Software for Exploratory Analysis of 
      High-Resolution Spectral Reflectance Data on Plant Breeding.
PG  - 1996
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2016.01996 [doi]
LID - 1996
AB  - This article describes public, free software that provides efficient exploratory 
      analysis of high-resolution spectral reflectance data. Spectral reflectance data 
      can suffer from problems such as poor signal to noise ratios in various wavebands 
      or invalid measurements due to changes in incoming solar radiation or operator 
      fatigue leading to poor orientation of sensors. Thus, exploratory data analysis 
      is essential to identify appropriate data for further analyses. This software 
      overcomes the problem that analysis tools such as Excel are cumbersome to use for 
      the high number of wavelengths and samples typically acquired in these studies. 
      The software, Spectral Knowledge (SK-UTALCA), was initially developed for plant 
      breeding, but it is also suitable for other studies such as precision 
      agriculture, crop protection, ecophysiology plant nutrition, and soil fertility. 
      Various spectral reflectance indices (SRIs) are often used to relate crop 
      characteristics to spectral data and the software is loaded with 255 SRIs which 
      can be applied quickly to the data. This article describes the architecture and 
      functions of SK-UTALCA and the features of the data that led to the development 
      of each of its modules.

TI  - [Study on the Identification of Geographical Indication Wuchang Rice Based on the 
      Content of Inorganic Elements].
PG  - 834-7
AB  - Wuchang rice is a geographical indication product in China. Due to its high 
      quality and low production, the phenome- non of fake is more and more serious. An 
      effective identification method of Wuchang rice is urgent needed, for the 
      maintenance of its brand image and interest of consumers. Base on the content of 
      inorganic elements which are analyzed by ICP-AES and ICP-MS in rice, the 
      identification model of Wuchang rice is studied combining with principal 
      component analysis (PCA), Fisher discrimination and artificial neural network 
      (ANN) in this paper. The effect on the identification of samples is poor through 
      PCA, while the samples from Wuchang area and other areas can be identified 
      accurately through Fisher discrimination and ANN. The average accurate 
      identification ratio of training and verification set through Fisher 
      discrimination is 93.5%, while the average accurate identification ratio through 
      ANN is 96.4%. The ability to identify of ANN is better than Fisher 
      discrimination. Wuchang rice can be identified accurately through the result of 
      this research which provides a technology for the protection of geographical 
      indications of this product.

TI  - Convergent Lines of Evidence Support LRP8 as a Susceptibility Gene for Psychosis.
PG  - 6608-6619
AB  - Reelin (RELN) is identified as a risk gene for major psychiatric disorders such 
      as schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD). However, the role of its 
      downstream signaling molecule, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related 
      protein 8 (LRP8) in these illnesses is still unclear. To detect whether LRP8 is a 
      susceptibility gene for SCZ and BPD, we analyzed the associations of single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LRP8 in a total of 47,187 subjects (including 
      9379 SCZ patients; 6990 BPD patients; and 12,556 controls in a screening sample, 
      and 1397 SCZ families, 3947 BPD patients, and 8387 controls in independent 
      replications), and identified a non-synonymous SNP rs5174 in LRP8 significantly 
      associated with SCZ and BPD as well as the combined psychosis phenotype (P 
      (meta) = 1.99 × 10(-5), odds ratio (OR) = 1.066, 95 % confidence interval 
      (CI) = 1.035-1.098). The risk SNP rs5174 was also associated with LRP8 messenger 
      RNA (mRNA) expression in multiple brain tissues across independent samples 
      (lowest P = 0.00005). Further exploratory analysis revealed that LRP8 was 
      preferentially expressed in fetal brain tissues. Protein-protein interaction 
      (PPI) analysis demonstrated that LRP8 significantly participated in a highly 
      interconnected PPI network build by top risk genes for SCZ and BPD 
      (P = 7.0 × 10(-4)). Collectively, we confirmed that LRP8 is a risk gene for 
      psychosis, and our results provide useful information toward a better 
      understanding of genetic mechanism involving LRP8 underlying risk of complex 
      psychiatric disorders.

LID - 33166
AB  - Independent replication is vital for study findings drawn from Electronic Health 
      Records (EHR). This replication study evaluates the relationship between seasonal 
      effects at birth and lifetime cardiovascular condition risk. We performed a 
      Season-wide Association Study on 1,169,599 patients from Mount Sinai Hospital 
      (MSH) to compute phenome-wide associations between birth month and CVD. We then 
      evaluated if seasonal patterns found at MSH matched those reported at Columbia 
      University Medical Center. Coronary arteriosclerosis, essential hypertension, 
      angina, and pre-infarction syndrome passed phenome-wide significance and their 
      seasonal patterns matched those previously reported. Atrial fibrillation, 
      cardiomyopathy, and chronic myocardial ischemia had consistent patterns but were 
      not phenome-wide significant. We confirm that CVD risk peaks for those born in 
      the late winter/early spring among the evaluated patient populations. The 
      replication findings bolster evidence for a seasonal birth month effect in CVD. 
      Further study is required to identify the environmental and developmental 
      mechanisms.

TI  - A survey of current trends in computational drug repositioning.
PG  - 2-12
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbv020 [doi]
AB  - Computational drug repositioning or repurposing is a promising and efficient tool 
      for discovering new uses from existing drugs and holds the great potential for 
      precision medicine in the age of big data. The explosive growth of large-scale 
      genomic and phenotypic data, as well as data of small molecular compounds with 
      granted regulatory approval, is enabling new developments for computational 
      repositioning. To achieve the shortest path toward new drug indications, advanced 
      data processing and analysis strategies are critical for making sense of these 
      heterogeneous molecular measurements. In this review, we show recent advancements 
      in the critical areas of computational drug repositioning from multiple aspects. 
      First, we summarize available data sources and the corresponding computational 
      repositioning strategies. Second, we characterize the commonly used computational 
      techniques. Third, we discuss validation strategies for repositioning studies, 
      including both computational and experimental methods. Finally, we highlight 
      potential opportunities and use-cases, including a few target areas such as 
      cancers. We conclude with a brief discussion of the remaining challenges in 
      computational drug repositioning.

TI  - Decreased glutathione biosynthesis contributes to EGFR T790M-driven erlotinib 
      resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 16031
AB  - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors such as erlotinib are novel 
      effective agents in the treatment of EGFR-driven lung cancer, but their clinical 
      impact is often impaired by acquired drug resistance through the secondary T790M 
      EGFR mutation. To overcome this problem, we analysed the metabonomic differences 
      between two independent pairs of erlotinib-sensitive/resistant cells and 
      discovered that glutathione (GSH) levels were significantly reduced in T790M EGFR 
      cells. We also found that increasing GSH levels in erlotinib-resistant cells 
      re-sensitised them, whereas reducing GSH levels in erlotinib-sensitive cells made 
      them resistant. Decreased transcription of the GSH-synthesising enzymes (GCLC and 
      GSS) due to the inhibition of NRF2 was responsible for low GSH levels in 
      resistant cells that was directly linked to the T790M mutation. T790M EGFR 
      clinical samples also showed decreased expression of these key enzymes; 
      increasing intra-tumoural GSH levels with a small-molecule GST inhibitor 
      re-sensitised resistant tumours to erlotinib in mice. Thus, we identified a new 
      resistance pathway controlled by EGFR T790M and a therapeutic strategy to tackle 
      this problem in the clinic.

TI  - Integrated analysis of phenome, genome, and transcriptome of hybrid rice 
      uncovered multiple heterosis-related loci for yield increase.
PG  - E6026-E6035
AB  - Hybrid rice is the dominant form of rice planted in China, and its use has 
      extended worldwide since the 1970s. It offers great yield advantages and has 
      contributed greatly to the world's food security. However, the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying heterosis have remained a mystery. In this study we 
      integrated genetics and omics analyses to determine the candidate genes for yield 
      heterosis in a model two-line rice hybrid system, Liang-you-pei 9 (LYP9) and its 
      parents. Phenomics study revealed that the better parent heterosis (BPH) of yield 
      in hybrid is not ascribed to BPH of all the yield components but is specific to 
      the BPH of spikelet number per panicle (SPP) and paternal parent heterosis (PPH) 
      of effective panicle number (EPN). Genetic analyses then identified multiple 
      quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these two components. Moreover, a number of 
      differentially expressed genes and alleles in the hybrid were mapped by 
      transcriptome profiling to the QTL regions as possible candidate genes. In 
      parallel, a major QTL for yield heterosis, rice heterosis 8 (RH8), was found to 
      be the DTH8/Ghd8/LHD1 gene. Based on the shared allelic heterozygosity of RH8 in 
      many hybrid rice cultivars, a common mechanism for yield heterosis in the present 
      commercial hybrid rice is proposed.

AB  - In this work, we review the main available computational methods of identifying 
      biomarkers of complex diseases from high-throughput data. The emerging omics 
      techniques provide powerful alternatives to measure thousands of molecules in 
      cells in parallel manners. The generated genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, 
      metabolomic and phenomic data provide comprehensive molecular and cellular 
      information for detecting critical signals served as biomarkers by classifying 
      disease phenotypic states. Networks are often employed to organize these profiles 
      in the identification of biomarkers to deal with complex diseases in diagnosis, 
      prognosis and therapy as well as mechanism deciphering from systematic 
      perspectives. Here, we summarize some representative network-based bioinformatics 
      methods in order to highlight the importance of computational strategies in 
      biomarker discovery.

TI  - Phenome-wide association study maps new diseases to the human major 
      histocompatibility complex region.
PG  - 681-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over 160 disease phenotypes have been mapped to the major 
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6 by genome-wide 
      association study (GWAS), suggesting that the MHC region as a whole may be 
      involved in the aetiology of many phenotypes, including unstudied diseases. The 
      phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), a powerful and complementary approach to 
      GWAS, has demonstrated its ability to discover and rediscover genetic 
      associations. The objective of this study is to comprehensively investigate the 
      MHC region by PheWAS to identify new phenotypes mapped to this genetically 
      important region. METHODS: In the current study, we systematically explored the 
      MHC region using PheWAS to associate 2692 MHC-linked variants (minor allele 
      frequency ≥0.01) with 6221 phenotypes in a cohort of 7481 subjects from the 
      Marshfield Clinic Personalized Medicine Research Project. RESULTS: Findings 
      showed that expected associations previously identified by GWAS could be 
      identified by PheWAS (eg, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, type I diabetes and 
      coeliac disease) with some having strong cross-phenotype associations potentially 
      driven by pleiotropic effects. Importantly, novel associations with eight 
      diseases not previously assessed by GWAS (eg, lichen planus) were also identified 
      and replicated in an independent population. Many of these associated diseases 
      appear to be immune-related disorders. Further assessment of these diseases in 
      16 484 Marshfield Clinic twins suggests that some of these diseases, including 
      lichen planus, may have genetic aetiologies. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      demonstrate that the PheWAS approach is a powerful and novel method to discover 
      SNP-disease associations, and is ideal when characterising cross-phenotype 
      associations, and further emphasise the importance of the MHC region in human 
      health and disease.

TI  - Psychiatric genetics in China: achievements and challenges.
PG  - 4-9
LID - 10.1038/mp.2015.95 [doi]
AB  - To coordinate research efforts in psychiatric genetics in China, a group of 
      Chinese and foreign investigators have established an annual “Summit on Chinese 
      Psychiatric Genetics” to present their latest research and discuss the current 
      state and future directions of this field. To date, two Summits have been held, 
      the first in Changsha in April, 2014, and the second in Kunming in April, 2015. 
      The consensus of roundtable discussions held at these meetings is that 
      psychiatric genetics in China is in need of new policies to promote 
      collaborations aimed at creating a framework for genetic research appropriate for 
      the Chinese population: relying solely on Caucasian population-based studies may 
      result in missed opportunities to diagnose and treat psychiatric disorders. In 
      addition, participants agree on the importance of promoting collaborations and 
      data sharing in areas where China has especially strong resources, such as 
      advanced facilities for non-human primate studies and traditional Chinese 
      medicine: areas that may also provide overseas investigators with unique research 
      opportunities. In this paper, we present an overview of the current state of 
      psychiatric genetics research in China, with emphasis on genome-level studies, 
      and describe challenges and opportunities for future advances, particularly at 
      the dawn of “precision medicine.” Together, we call on administrative bodies, 
      funding agencies, the research community, and the public at large for increased 
      support for research on the genetic basis of psychiatric disorders in the Chinese 
      population. In our opinion, increased public awareness and effective 
      collaborative research hold the keys to the future of psychiatric genetics in 
      China.

      Wheat.
PG  - 20593
LID - 10.1038/srep20593 [doi]
LID - 20593
AB  - Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) is a worldwide problem for wheat production and 
      transgene antisense-thioredoxin-s (anti-trx-s) facilitates outstanding 
      resistance. To understand the molecular details of PHS resistance, we analyzed 
      the metabonomes of the transgenic and wild-type (control) wheat seeds at various 
      stages using NMR and GC-FID/MS. 60 metabolites were dominant in these seeds 
      including sugars, organic acids, amino acids, choline metabolites and fatty 
      acids. At day-20 post-anthesis, only malate level in transgenic wheat differed 
      significantly from that in controls whereas at day-30 post-anthesis, levels of 
      amino acids and sucrose were significantly different between these two groups. 
      For mature seeds, most metabolites in glycolysis, TCA cycle, choline metabolism, 
      biosynthesis of proteins, nucleotides and fatty acids had significantly lower 
      levels in transgenic seeds than in controls. After 30-days post-harvest ripening, 
      most metabolites in transgenic seeds had higher levels than in controls including 
      amino acids, sugars, organic acids, fatty acids, choline metabolites and NAD(+). 
      These indicated that anti-trx-s lowered overall metabolic activities of mature 
      seeds eliminating pre-harvest sprouting potential. Post-harvest ripening 
      reactivated the metabolic activities of transgenic seeds to restore their 
      germination vigor. These findings provided essential molecular phenomic 
      information for PHS resistance of anti-trx-s and a credible strategy for future 
      developing PHS resistant crops.

TI  - Endometrial cancer with cervical stromal invasion: diagnostic accuracy of 
      diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging at 3T.
PG  - 1867-1876
LID - 10.1007/s00330-016-4583-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of diffusion-weighted (DW) and 
      dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for detecting 
      cervical stromal invasion in endometrial cancer. METHODS: Eighty-three 
      consecutive women with endometrial cancer underwent preoperative evaluation in a 
      3-T unit, including T2-weighted, DW (b = 0 and 1000 s/mm(2)), and DCE MR imaging. 
      Two radiologists independently assessed presence of cervical stromal invasion, 
      with histopathological reference as gold standard. RESULTS: For assessing 
      cervical stromal invasion, the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, 
      respectively for Reader 1/Reader 2, were as follows: DW MR imaging- 
      95.2 %/91.6 %, 91.7 %/100 %, and 95.8 %/90.1 %; DCE MR imaging- 91.6 %/88 %, 
      58.3 %/50 %, and 97.2 %/94.4 %. The diagnostic performance of DW MR imaging 
      (Reader 1: areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.98; 
      Reader 2: AUC = 0.97) was significantly higher than that of DCE MR imaging 
      (p = 0.009 for Reader 2) or T2-weighted MR imaging (Reader 1: p = 0.006; Reader 
      2: p = 0.013). Patients with cervical stromal invasion showed a significantly 
      greater canal width (p < 0.0001) and myometrial invasion extent (p = 0.006). 
      CONCLUSIONS: DW MR imaging has superior diagnostic performance compared with DCE 
      MR imaging in the detection of cervical stromal invasion. KEY POINTS: • DWI 
      demonstrates a higher accuracy than DCE in detecting cervical stromal invasion. • 
      Tumour ADC values are similar between patients without or with cervical invasion. 
      • Canal widening causes false-negativity on DCE and T2W but not on DWI.

TI  - (1) H MR spectroscopy in cervical carcinoma using external phase array body coil 
      at 3.0 Tesla: Prediction of poor prognostic human papillomavirus genotypes.
PG  - 899-907
LID - 10.1002/jmri.25386 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the clinical value of proton ((1) H) MR spectroscopy in 
      cervical carcinomas, in the prediction of poor prognostic human papillomavirus 
      (HPV) genotypes as well as persistent disease following concurrent 
      chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: (1) H MR spectroscopy using 
      external phase array coil was performed in 52 consecutive cervical cancer 
      patients at 3 Tesla (T). Poor prognostic HPV genotypes (alpha-7 species or 
      absence of HPV infection) and persistent cervical carcinoma after CCRT were 
      recorded. Statistical significance was calculated with the Mann-Whitney two-sided 
      nonparametric test and areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve 
      (AUC) analysis. RESULTS: A 4.3-fold (P = 0.032) increased level of methyl 
      resonance at 0.9 ppm was found in the poor prognostic HPV genotypes, mainly 
      attributed to the presence of HPV18, with a sensitivity of 75%, a specificity of 
      81%, and an AUC of 0.76. Poor prognostic HPV genotypes were more frequently 
      observed in patients with adeno-/adenosquamous carcinoma (Chi-square, 
      P < 0.0001). In prediction of the four patients with persistent disease after 
      CCRT, elevated methyl resonance demonstrated a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity 
      of 74%, and an AUC of 0.82. CONCLUSION: (1) H MR spectroscopy at 3T can be used 
      to depict the elevated lipid resonance levels in cervical carcinomas, as well as 
      help to predict the poor prognostic HPV genotypes and persistent disease 
      following CCRT. Further large studies with longer follow up times are warranted 
      to validate our initial findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging

AB  - PURPOSE: Ethnic variation in epilepsy classification was reported in the Epilepsy 
      Phenome/Genome Project. This study aimed to determine the ethnic variation in the 
      prevalence of genetic (idiopathic) generalized epilepsy (GGE) and GGE with family 
      history in a multi-ethnic Asian population in Malaysia. METHOD: In this 
      cross-sectional study, 392 patients with a clinical diagnosis of GGE were 
      recruited in the neurology outpatient clinic, University of Malaya Medical Centre 
      (UMMC), from January 2011 till April 2016. RESULTS: In our epilepsy cohort 
      (n=2100), 18.7% were diagnosed to have GGE. Of those, 28.6% >(N=112) had family 
      history of epilepsy with a mean age of seizure onset of 16.5 years old, and 42.0% 
      had myoclonic seizures (N=47). The lifetime prevalence of epilepsy among 
      first-degree relative of those with GGE and positive family history was 15.0%. 
      Analysis according to ethnicity showed that Malaysian Chinese had the lowest 
      percentage of GGE among those with epilepsy (12.3%), as compared with Indian and 
      Malay (25.3% and 21.3%, p<0.001). In addition, 32.1% of these Indian patients 
      with GGE had positive family history, which is more than the Malay (26.4%) and 
      Chinese (27.5%) ethnic groups. Consanguineous marriage was noted in 5 Indian 
      families with positive family history (9.6%). CONCLUSION: There was ethnic 
      variation in the prevalence of GGE, whereby the Malaysian Chinese had the lowest 
      percentage of GGE as compared with Indian and Malay. A substantial proportion of 
      GGE had positive family history among the three ethnics groups.

LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b01481 [doi]
AB  - To better understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning physiological 
      variation in human populations, metabolic phenotyping approaches are increasingly 
      being applied to studies involving hundreds and thousands of biofluid samples. 
      Hyphenated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) 
      has become a fundamental tool for this purpose. However, the seemingly inevitable 
      need to analyze large studies in multiple analytical batches for UPLC-MS analysis 
      poses a challenge to data quality which has been recognized in the field. Herein, 
      we describe in detail a fit-for-purpose UPLC-MS platform, method set, and sample 
      analysis workflow, capable of sustained analysis on an industrial scale and 
      allowing batch-free operation for large studies. Using complementary 
      reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) and hydrophilic interaction liquid 
      chromatography (HILIC) together with high resolution orthogonal acceleration 
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry (oaTOF-MS), exceptional measurement precision is 
      exemplified with independent epidemiological sample sets of approximately 650 and 
      1000 participant samples. Evaluation of molecular reference targets in repeated 
      injections of pooled quality control (QC) samples distributed throughout each 
      experiment demonstrates a mean retention time relative standard deviation (RSD) 
      of <0.3% across all assays in both studies and a mean peak area RSD of <15% in 
      the raw data. To more globally assess the quality of the profiling data, 
      untargeted feature extraction was performed followed by data filtration according 
      to feature intensity response to QC sample dilution. Analysis of the remaining 
      features within the repeated QC sample measurements demonstrated median peak area 
      RSD values of <20% for the RPC assays and <25% for the HILIC assays. These values 
      represent the quality of the raw data, as no normalization or feature-specific 
      intensity correction was applied. While the data in each experiment was acquired 
      in a single continuous batch, instances of minor time-dependent intensity drift 
      were observed, highlighting the utility of data correction techniques despite 
      reducing the dependency on them for generating high quality data. These results 
      demonstrate that the platform and methodology presented herein is fit-for-use in 
      large scale metabolic phenotyping studies, challenging the assertion that such 
      screening is inherently limited by batch effects. Details of the pipeline used to 
      generate high quality raw data and mitigate the need for batch correction are 
      provided.

PG  - 924-936

AB  - The adoptive transfer of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) has proven to 
      attenuate inflammation in multiple mouse models of colitis; however, the effect 
      of cryopreservation on AAMs, the ability of previously frozen AAMs to block 
      dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS) (Th1) and oxazolone (Th2) colitis and their 
      migration postinjection remains unknown. Here we have found that while 
      cryopreservation reduced mRNA expression of canonical markers of interleukin 
      (IL)-4-treated macrophages [M(IL-4)], this step did not translate to reduced 
      protein or activity, and the cells retained their capacity to drive the 
      suppression of colitis. The anticolitic effect of M(IL-4) adoptive transfer 
      required neither T or B cell nor peritoneal macrophages in the recipient. After 
      injection into the peritoneal cavity, M(IL-4)s migrated to the spleen, mesenteric 
      lymph nodes and colon of DNBS-treated mice. The chemokines CCL2, CCL4 and CX3CL1 
      were expressed in the colon during the course of DNBS-induced colitis. The 
      expression of integrin β7 on transferred M(IL-4)s was required for their 
      anticolitic effect, whereas the presence of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and 
      CX3CR1 were dispensable in this model. Collectively, the data show that M(IL-4)s 
      can be cryopreserved M(IL-4)s and subsequently used to suppress colitis in an 
      integrin β7-dependent manner, and we suggest that these proof-of-concept studies 
      may lead to new cellular therapies for human inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Elucidation of the Metabolic Network of Helicobacter pylori J99 and Malaysian 
      Clinical Strains by Phenotype Microarray.
LID - 10.1111/hel.12321 [doi]
LID - e12321
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori colonizes almost half of the human population 
      worldwide. H. pylori strains are genetically diverse, and the specific genotypes 
      are associated with various clinical manifestations including gastric 
      adenocarcinoma, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD). 
      However, our current knowledge of the H. pylori metabolism is limited. To 
      understand the metabolic differences among H. pylori strains, we investigated 
      four Malaysian H. pylori clinical strains, which had been previously sequenced, 
      and a standard strain, H. pylori J99, at the phenotypic level. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The phenotypes of the H. pylori strains were profiled using the Biolog 
      Phenotype Microarray system to corroborate genomic data. We initiated the 
      analyses by predicting carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways from the H. pylori 
      genomic data from the KEGG database. Biolog PM aided the validation of the 
      prediction and provided a more intensive analysis of the H. pylori phenomes. 
      RESULTS: We have identified a core set of metabolic nutrient sources that was 
      utilized by all strains tested and another set that was differentially utilized 
      by only the local strains. Pentose sugars are the preferred carbon nutrients 
      utilized by H. pylori. The amino acids l-aspartic acid, d-alanine, and 
      l-asparagine serve as both carbon and nitrogen sources in the metabolism of the 
      bacterium. CONCLUSION: The phenotypic profile based on this study provides a 
      better understanding on the survival of H. pylori in its natural host. Our data 
      serve as a foundation for future challenges in correlating interstrain metabolic 
      differences in H. pylori.

TI  - The Current Landscape of Genetic Testing in Cardiovascular Malformations: 
      Opportunities and Challenges.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2016.00022 [doi]
LID - 22
AB  - Human cardiovascular malformations (CVMs) frequently have a genetic contribution. 
      Through the application of novel technologies, such as next-generation 
      sequencing, DNA sequence variants associated with CVMs are being identified at a 
      rapid pace. While clinicians are now able to offer testing with NGS gene panels 
      or whole exome sequencing to any patient with a CVM, the interpretation of 
      genetic variation remains problematic. Variable phenotypic expression, reduced 
      penetrance, inconsistent phenotyping methods, and the lack of high-throughput 
      functional testing of variants contribute to these challenges. This article 
      elaborates critical issues that impact the decision to broadly implement clinical 
      molecular genetic testing in CVMs. Major benefits of testing include establishing 
      a genetic diagnosis, facilitating cost-effective screening of family members who 
      may have subclinical disease, predicting recurrence risk in offsprings, enabling 
      early diagnosis and anticipatory management of CV and non-CV disease phenotypes, 
      predicting long-term outcomes, and facilitating the development of novel 
      therapies aimed at disease improvement or prevention. Limitations include 
      financial cost, psychosocial cost, and ambiguity of interpretation of results. 
      Multiplex families and patients with syndromic features are two groups where 
      disease causation could potentially be firmly established. However, these account 
      for the minority of the overall CVM population, and there is increasing 
      recognition that genotypes previously associated with syndromes also exist in 
      patients who lack non-CV findings. In all circumstances, ongoing dialog between 
      cardiologists and clinical geneticists will be needed to accurately interpret 
      genetic testing and improve these patients' health. This may be most effectively 
      implemented by the creation and support of CV genetics services at centers 
      committed to pursuing testing for patients.

LID - S0165-0270(15)00430-6 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: An objective and automated method for assessing alterations in gait 
      and motor coordination in different animal models is important for proper gait 
      analysis. The CatWalk system has been used in pain research, ischemia, arthritis, 
      spinal cord injury and some animal models for neurodegenerative diseases. NEW 
      METHOD: Our goals were to obtain a comprehensive gait analysis of three different 
      rat models and to identify which motor coordination parameters are affected and 
      are the most suitable and sensitive to describe and detect ataxia with a 
      secondary focus on possible training effects. RESULTS: Both static and dynamic 
      parameters showed significant differences in all three models: enriched housed 
      rats show higher walking and swing speed and longer stride length, 
      ethanol-induced ataxia affects mainly the hind part of the body, and the SCA17 
      rats show coordination disturbances. Coordination changes were revealed only in 
      the case of the ethanol-induced ataxia and the SCA17 rat model. Although training 
      affected some gait parameters, it did not obscure group differences when those 
      were present. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: To our knowledge, a comparative 
      gait assessment in rats with enriched housing conditions, ethanol-induced ataxia 
      and SCA17 has not been presented before. CONCLUSIONS: There is no gold standard 
      for the use of CatWalk. Dependent on the specific effects expected, the protocol 
      can be adjusted. By including all sessions in the analysis, any training effect 
      should be detectable and the development of the performance over the sessions can 
      provide insight in effects attributed to intervention, treatment or injury.

TI  - MultispeQ Beta: a tool for large-scale plant phenotyping connected to the open 
      PhotosynQ network.
PG  - 160592
LID - 160592
AB  - Large-scale high-throughput plant phenotyping (sometimes called phenomics) is 
      becoming increasingly important in plant biology and agriculture and is essential 
      to cutting-edge plant breeding and management approaches needed to meet the food 
      and fuel needs for the next century. Currently, the application of these 
      approaches is severely limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation 
      and by the ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. 
      To address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated 
      open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of researchers, 
      plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists to collect high-quality 
      field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ provides measurements in the field or 
      laboratory of both, environmental conditions (light intensity and quality, 
      temperature, humidity, CO(2) levels, time and location) and useful plant 
      phenotypes, including photosynthetic parameters-photosystem II quantum yield 
      (Φ(II)), non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II 
      photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton motive 
      force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially many others-and 
      leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype data are transmitted from 
      the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers together with key 
      metadata that gets saved to the PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and 
      provides a suite of web-based tools for sharing, visualization, filtering, 
      dissemination and analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing 
      MultispeQ results with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully 
      deployed in both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that 
      MultispeQ can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and 
      analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper 
      understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment.

AB  - Genome-wide polygenic scores (GPS), which aggregate the effects of thousands of 
      DNA variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have the potential to 
      make genetic predictions for individuals. We conducted a systematic investigation 
      of associations between GPS and many behavioral traits, the behavioral phenome. 
      For 3152 unrelated 16-year-old individuals representative of the United Kingdom, 
      we created 13 GPS from the largest GWAS for psychiatric disorders (for example, 
      schizophrenia, depression and dementia) and cognitive traits (for example, 
      intelligence, educational attainment and intracranial volume). The behavioral 
      phenome included 50 traits from the domains of psychopathology, personality, 
      cognitive abilities and educational achievement. We examined phenome-wide 
      profiles of associations for the entire distribution of each GPS and for the 
      extremes of the GPS distributions. The cognitive GPS yielded stronger predictive 
      power than the psychiatric GPS in our UK-representative sample of adolescents. 
      For example, education GPS explained variation in adolescents' behavior problems 
      (~0.6%) and in educational achievement (~2%) but psychiatric GPS were associated 
      with neither. Despite the modest effect sizes of current GPS, quantile analyses 
      illustrate the ability to stratify individuals by GPS and opportunities for 
      research. For example, the highest and lowest septiles for the education GPS 
      yielded a 0.5 s.d. difference in mean math grade and a 0.25 s.d. difference in 
      mean behavior problems. We discuss the usefulness and limitations of GPS based on 
      adult GWAS to predict genetic propensities earlier in development.

AB  - Articular cartilage integrity loss is a prominently deleterious feature of 
      osteoarthritis (OA). The mechanistic underlying the development of OA warrants 
      characterization. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), members of the chaperone family, 
      reportedly orchestrate tissue homeostasis and remodeling in response to 
      detrimental stress. This study was undertaken to characterize the biological role 
      of HSP60 in the pathogenesis of OA knee. Articular specimens from OA knee 
      patients displayed severe articular damage histopathology concomitant with low 
      HSP60 concentrations in cartilage and synovial fluid compared to non-OA patients. 
      In vitro, a gain of HSP60 signaling counteracted the IL-1β-mediated suppression 
      of mitochondrial biogenesis, chondrogenic transcription factor SOX9, and 
      cartilage matrix expression of human chondrocytes cultures. Transgenic mice that 
      overexpressed human HSP60 (TgHSP60) had higher chondrocyte proliferation and 
      thicker articular cartilage than wild-type mice. In collagenase-induced OA knees, 
      analyses of CatWalk, 2-deoxyglucose-probed fluorescence imaging, and μCT revealed 
      that affected knees of TgHSP60 mice showed minor footprint irregularity, joint 
      inflammation, and osteophyte formation. HSP60 overexpression also alleviated the 
      histopathology of cartilage damage, synovial hypervascularization, and macrophage 
      infiltration within joint lesions. Intra-articular administration of exogenous 
      HSP60 ameliorated the pathogenesis of cartilage deterioration, synovitis, and 
      osteophyte accumulation, thereby improving gait profiles of the 
      collagenase-injured knees. HSP60 signaling maintains SOX9 levels by attenuating 
      SOX9 hyper-ubiquitination of affected joints. Taken together, HSP60 deficiency in 
      articular compartments was relevant to OA knee incidence. Sustained HSP60 
      signaling is favorable to mitigate the progression of OA. This study highlights 
      the joint-anabolic actions of HSP60 and provides perspective on its therapeutic 
      potential for OA. KEY MESSAGES: HSP60 deficiency is relevant to the existence of 
      end-stage knee osteoarthritis. HSP60 overexpression attenuates cartilage matrix 
      loss of inflammatory chondrocytes. HSP60 transgenic mice showed mild articular 
      injury during knee osteoarthritis. HSP60 maintains knee joint homeostasis through 
      reducing SOX9 ubiquitination. Control of cartilage-anabolic regulator HSP60 
      ameliorates knee osteoarthritis.

LID - 10.1038/npjbiofilms.2016.14 [doi]
AB  - The ligand-induced transcription factor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is known 
      for its capacity to tune adaptive immunity and xenobiotic metabolism-biological 
      properties subject to regulation by the indigenous microbiome. The objective of 
      this study was to probe the postulated microbiome-AhR crosstalk and whether such 
      an axis could influence metabolic homeostasis of the host. Utilising a 
      systems-biology approach combining in-depth (1)H-NMR-based metabonomics (plasma, 
      liver and skeletal muscle) with microbiome profiling (small intestine, colon and 
      faeces) of AhR knockout (AhR(-/-)) and wild-type (AhR(+/+)) mice, we assessed AhR 
      function in host metabolism. Microbiome metabolites such as short-chain fatty 
      acids were found to regulate AhR and its target genes in liver and intestine. The 
      AhR signalling pathway, in turn, was able to influence microbiome composition in 
      the small intestine as evident from microbiota profiling of the AhR(+/+) and 
      AhR(-/-) mice fed with diet enriched with a specific AhR ligand or diet depleted 
      of any known AhR ligands. The AhR(-/-) mice also displayed increased levels of 
      corticosterol and alanine in serum. In addition, activation of gluconeogenic 
      genes in the AhR(-/-) mice was indicative of on-going metabolic stress. Reduced 
      levels of ketone bodies and reduced expression of genes involved in fatty acid 
      metabolism in the liver further underscored this observation. Interestingly, 
      exposing AhR(-/-) mice to a high-fat diet showed resilience to glucose 
      intolerance. Our data suggest the existence of a bidirectional AhR-microbiome 
      axis, which influences host metabolic pathways.

AB  - Intellectual disability (ID) disorders are genetically and phenotypically 
      extremely heterogeneous. Can this complexity be depicted in a comprehensive way 
      as a means of facilitating the understanding of ID disorders and their underlying 
      biology? We provide a curated database of 746 currently known genes, mutations in 
      which cause ID (ID-associated genes [ID-AGs]), classified according to ID 
      manifestation and associated clinical features. Using this integrated resource, 
      we show that ID-AGs are substantially enriched with co-expression, 
      protein-protein interactions, and specific biological functions. Systematic 
      identification of highly enriched functional themes and phenotypes revealed 
      typical phenotype combinations characterizing process-defined groups of ID 
      disorders, such as chromatin-related disorders and deficiencies in DNA repair. 
      Strikingly, phenotype classification efficiently breaks down ID-AGs into subsets 
      with significantly elevated biological coherence and predictive power. 
      Custom-made functional Drosophila datasets revealed further characteristic 
      phenotypes among ID-AGs and specific clinical classes. Our study and resource 
      provide systematic insights into the molecular and clinical landscape of ID 
      disorders, represent a significant step toward overcoming current limitations in 
      ID research, and prove the utility of systematic human and cross-species 
      phenomics analyses in highly heterogeneous genetic disorders.

TI  - Image Harvest: an open-source platform for high-throughput plant image processing 
      and analysis.
PG  - 3587-99
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erw176 [doi]
AB  - High-throughput plant phenotyping is an effective approach to bridge the 
      genotype-to-phenotype gap in crops. Phenomics experiments typically result in 
      large-scale image datasets, which are not amenable for processing on desktop 
      computers, thus creating a bottleneck in the image-analysis pipeline. Here, we 
      present an open-source, flexible image-analysis framework, called Image Harvest 
      (IH), for processing images originating from high-throughput plant phenotyping 
      platforms. Image Harvest is developed to perform parallel processing on computing 
      grids and provides an integrated feature for metadata extraction from large-scale 
      file organization. Moreover, the integration of IH with the Open Science Grid 
      provides academic researchers with the computational resources required for 
      processing large image datasets at no cost. Image Harvest also offers 
      functionalities to extract digital traits from images to interpret plant 
      architecture-related characteristics. To demonstrate the applications of these 
      digital traits, a rice (Oryza sativa) diversity panel was phenotyped and 
      genome-wide association mapping was performed using digital traits that are used 
      to describe different plant ideotypes. Three major quantitative trait loci were 
      identified on rice chromosomes 4 and 6, which co-localize with quantitative trait 
      loci known to regulate agronomically important traits in rice. Image Harvest is 
      an open-source software for high-throughput image processing that requires a 
      minimal learning curve for plant biologists to analyzephenomics datasets.

TI  - reChIP-seq reveals widespread bivalency of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in CD4(+) memory 
      T cells.
PG  - 12514

AB  - The combinatorial action of co-localizing chromatin modifications and regulators 
      determines chromatin structure and function. However, identifying co-localizing 
      chromatin features in a high-throughput manner remains a technical challenge. 
      Here we describe a novel reChIP-seq approach and tailored bioinformatic analysis 
      tool, normR that allows for the sequential enrichment and detection of 
      co-localizing DNA-associated proteins in an unbiased and genome-wide manner. We 
      illustrate the utility of the reChIP-seq method and normR by identifying H3K4me3 
      or H3K27me3 bivalently modified nucleosomes in primary human CD4(+) memory T 
      cells. We unravel widespread bivalency at hypomethylated CpG-islands coinciding 
      with inactive promoters of developmental regulators. reChIP-seq additionally 
      uncovered heterogeneous bivalency in the population, which was undetectable by 
      intersecting H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq tracks. Finally, we provide evidence 
      that bivalency is established and stabilized by an interplay between the genome 
      and epigenome. Our reChIP-seq approach augments conventional ChIP-seq and is 
      broadly applicable to unravel combinatorial modes of action.

TI  - Genome-assisted Breeding For Drought Resistance.
PG  - 330-42
LID - 10.2174/1389202917999160211101417 [doi]
AB  - Drought stress caused by unpredictable precipitation poses a major threat to food 
      production worldwide, and its impact is only expected to increase with the 
      further onset of climate change. Understanding the effect of drought stress on 
      crops and plants' response is critical for developing improved varieties with 
      stable high yield to fill a growing food gap from an increasing population 
      depending on decreasing land and water resources. When a plant encounters drought 
      stress, it may use multiple response types, depending on environmental 
      conditions, drought stress intensity and duration, and the physiological stage of 
      the plant. Drought stress responses can be divided into four broad types: drought 
      escape, drought avoidance, drought tolerance, and drought recovery, each 
      characterized by interacting mechanisms, which may together be referred to as 
      drought resistance mechanisms. The complex nature of drought resistance requires 
      a multi-pronged approach to breed new varieties with stable and enhanced yield 
      under drought stress conditions. High throughput genomics and phenomics allow 
      marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genomic selection (GS), which offer rapid and 
      targeted improvement of populations and identification of parents for rapid 
      genetic gains and improved drought-resistant varieties. Using these approaches 
      together with appropriate genetic diversity, databases, analytical tools, and 
      well-characterized drought stress scenarios, weather and soil data, new varieties 
      with improved drought resistance corresponding to grower preferences can be 
      introduced into target regions rapidly.

      We have previously shown that treatment of young dystrophic mdx and 
      dystrophin/utrophin null (dko) mice with BGP-15, a coinducer of heat shock 
      protein 72, ameliorated the dystrophic pathology. We therefore tested the 
      hypothesis that later-stage BGP-15 treatment would similarly benefit older mdx 
      and dko mice when the dystrophic pathology was already well established. Later 
      stage treatment of mdx or dko mice with BGP-15 did not improve maximal force of 
      tibialis anterior (TA) muscles (in situ) or diaphragm muscle strips (in vitro). 
      However, collagen deposition (fibrosis) was reduced in TA muscles of 
      BGP-15-treated dko mice but unchanged in TA muscles of treated mdx mice and 
      diaphragm of treated mdx and dko mice. We also examined whether BGP-15 treatment 
      could ameliorate aspects of the cardiac pathology, and in young dko mice it 
      reduced collagen deposition and improved both membrane integrity and systolic 
      function. These results confirm BGP-15's ability to improve aspects of the 
      dystrophic pathology but with differing efficacies in heart and skeletal muscles 
      at different stages of the disease progression. These findings support a role for 
      BGP-15 among a suite of pharmacological therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
      and related disorders.

TI  - Phenotyping of Eggplant Wild Relatives and Interspecific Hybrids with 
      Conventional and Phenomics Descriptors Provides Insight for Their Potential 
      Utilization in Breeding.

AB  - Eggplant (Solanum melongena) is related to a large number of wild species that 
      are a source of variation for breeding programmes, in particular for traits 
      related to adaptation to climate change. However, wild species remain largely 
      unexploited for eggplant breeding. Detailed phenotypic characterization of wild 
      species and their hybrids with eggplant may allow identifying promising wild 
      species and information on the genetic control and heterosis of relevant traits. 
      We characterizated six eggplant accessions, 21 accessions of 12 wild species (the 
      only primary genepool species S. insanum and 11 secondary genepool species) and 
      45 interspecific hybrids of eggplant with wild species (18 with S. insanum and 27 
      with secondary genepool species) using 27 conventional morphological descriptors 
      and 20 fruit morphometric descriptors obtained with the phenomics tool Tomato 
      Analyzer. Significant differences were observed among cultivated, wild and 
      interspecific hybrid groups for 18 conventional and 18 Tomato Analyzer 
      descriptors, with hybrids generally having intermediate values. Wild species were 
      generally more variable than cultivated accessions and interspecific hybrids 
      displayed intermediate ranges of variation and coefficient of variation (CV) 
      values, except for fruit shape traits in which the latter were the most variable. 
      The multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) reveals a clear separation 
      of wild species and cultivated accessions. Interspecific hybrids with S. insanum 
      plotted closer to cultivated eggplant, while hybrids with secondary genepool 
      species generally clustered together with wild species. Many differences were 
      observed among wild species for traits of agronomic interest, which allowed 
      identifying species of greatest potential interest for eggplant breeding. 
      Heterosis values were positive for most vigor-related traits, while for fruit 
      size values were close to zero for hybrids with S. incanum and highly negative 
      for hybrids with secondary genepool species. Our results allowed the 
      identification of potentially interesting wild species and interspecific hybrids 
      for introgression breeding in eggplant. This is an important step for broadening 
      the genetic base of eggplant and for breeding for adaptation to climate change in 
      this crop.

AB  - To dissect the role of immunogenetics in allergy and asthma, we performed a 
      phenome-wide association study in 974 Turkish children selected from a 
      cross-sectional study conducted using ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and 
      Allergies in Children) Phase II tools. We investigated 9 loci involved in 
      different immune functions (ADAM33, ADRB2, CD14, IL13, IL4, IL4R, MS4A2, 
      SERPINE1, and TNF) with respect to 116 traits assessed through blood tests, 
      hypertonic saline challenge tests, questionnaires, and skin prick tests. Multiple 
      associations were observed for ADAM33: rs2280090 was associated with reduced 
      MEF240% (i.e., the ratio of Mean Expiratory Flow after 240s of hypertonic saline 
      inhalation with respect to the age- and ancestry-matched reference value) and 
      with an increased risk of allergic bronchitis (p = 1.77*10(-4) and 
      p = 7.94*10(-4), respectively); rs3918396 was associated with wheezing and eczema 
      comorbidity (p = 3.41*10(-4)). IL4 rs2243250 was associated with increased FEV240 
      (Forced Expiratory Flow Volume after 240s of hypertonic saline inhalation; 
      p = 4.81*10(-4)) and CD14 rs2569190 was associated with asthma diagnosis 
      (p = 1.36*10(-3)). ADAM33 and IL4 appeared to play a role in the processes linked 
      to allergic airway inflammation and lung function. Due to its association with 
      wheezing and eczema comorbidity, ADAM33 may also be involved in the atopic march.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly emerging as an important model organism for 
      aquatic neuropharmacology and toxicology research. The behavioral/phenotypic 
      complexity of zebrafish allows for thorough dissection of complex human brain 
      disorders and drug-evoked pathological states. As numerous zebrafish models 
      become available with a wide spectrum of behavioral, genetic, and environmental 
      methods to test novel drugs, here we discuss recent zebrafish phenomics methods 
      to facilitate drug discovery, particularly in the field of biological psychiatry. 
      Additionally, behavioral, neurological, and endocrine endpoints are becoming 
      increasingly well-characterized in zebrafish, making them an inexpensive, robust 
      and effective model for toxicology research and pharmacological screening. We 
      also discuss zebrafish behavioral phenotypes, experimental considerations, 
      pharmacological candidates and relevance of zebrafish neurophenomics to other 
      'omics' (e.g., genomic, proteomic) approaches. Finally, we critically evaluate 
      the limitations of utilizing this model organism, and outline future strategies 
      of research in the field of zebrafish phenomics.

AB  - Methylamines are biologically-active metabolites present in serum and urine 
      samples, which play complex roles in metabolic diseases. Methylamines can be 
      detected by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), but specific methods remain 
      to be developed for their routine assay in human serum in clinical settings. Here 
      we developed and validated a novel reliable "methylamine panel" method for 
      simultaneous quantitative analysis of trimethylamine (TMA), its major 
      detoxification metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), and precursors choline, 
      betaine and l-carnitine in human serum using Ultra Performance Liquid 
      Chromatography (UPLC) coupled to High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS). 
      Metabolite separation was carried out on a HILIC stationary phase. For all 
      metabolites, the assay was linear in the range of 0.25-12.5 μmol/L and enabled to 
      reach limit of detection of about 0.10 μmol/L. Relative standard deviations were 
      below 16% for the three levels of concentrations. We demonstrated the strong 
      reliability and robustness of the method, which was applied to serum samples from 
      healthy individuals to establish the range of concentrations of the metabolites 
      and their correlation relationships and detect gender differences. Our data 
      provide original information for implementing in a clinical environment a 
      MS-based diagnostic method with potential for targeted metabolic screening of 
      patients at risk of cardiometabolic diseases.

TI  - World Endometriosis Society consensus on the classification of endometriosis.
PG  - 315-324
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dew293 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: What is the global consensus on the classification of 
      endometriosis that considers the views of women with endometriosis? SUMMARY 
      ANSWER: We have produced an international consensus statement on the 
      classification of endometriosis through systematic appraisal of evidence and a 
      consensus process that included representatives of national and international, 
      medical and non-medical societies, patient organizations, and companies with an 
      interest in endometriosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Classification systems of 
      endometriosis, developed by several professional organizations, traditionally 
      have been based on lesion appearance, pelvic adhesions, and anatomic location of 
      disease. One system predicts fertility outcome and none predicts pelvic pain, 
      response to medications, disease recurrence, risks for associated disorders, 
      quality of life measures, and other endpoints important to women and health care 
      providers for guiding appropriate therapeutic options and prognosis. STUDY 
      DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A consensus meeting, in conjunction with pre- and 
      post-meeting processes, was undertaken. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: 
      A consensus meeting was held on 30 April 2014 in conjunction with the World 
      Endometriosis Society's 12th World Congress on Endometriosis. Rigorous pre- and 
      post-meeting processes, involving 55 representatives of 29 national and 
      international, medical and non-medical organizations from a range of disciplines, 
      led to this consensus statement. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 
      28 consensus statements were made. Of all, 10 statements had unanimous consensus, 
      however none of the statements was made without expression of a caveat about the 
      strength of the statement or the statement itself. Two statements did not achieve 
      majority consensus. The statements covered women's priorities, aspects of 
      classification, impact of low resources, as well as all the major classification 
      systems for endometriosis. Until better classification systems are developed, we 
      propose a classification toolbox (that includes the revised American Society for 
      Reproductive Medicine and, where appropriate, the Enzian and Endometriosis 
      Fertility Index staging systems), that may be used by all surgeons in each case 
      of surgery undertaken for women with endometriosis. We also propose wider use of 
      the World Endometriosis Research Foundation Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking 
      Harmonisation Project surgical and clinical data collection tools for research to 
      improve classification of endometriosis in the future, of particular relevance 
      when surgery is not undertaken. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This consensus 
      process differed from that of formal guideline development, although based on the 
      same available evidence. A different group of international experts from those 
      participating in this process may have yielded subtly different consensus 
      statements. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first time that a 
      large, global, consortium-representing 29 major stake-holding organizations, from 
      19 countries - has convened to systematically evaluate the best available 
      evidence on the classification of endometriosis and reach consensus. In addition 
      to 21 international medical organizations and companies, representatives from 
      eight national endometriosis organizations were involved, including lay support 
      groups, thus generating and including input from women who suffer from 
      endometriosis in an endeavour to keep uppermost the goal of optimizing quality of 
      life for women with endometriosis. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The World 
      Endometriosis Society convened and hosted the consensus meeting. Financial 
      support for participants to attend the meeting was provided by the organizations 
      that they represented. There was no other specific funding for this consensus 
      process. Mauricio Abrao is an advisor to Bayer Pharma, and a consultant to AbbVie

TI  - No Reliable Association between Runs of Homozygosity and Schizophrenia in a 
      Well-Powered Replication Study.
PG  - e1006343

AB  - It is well known that inbreeding increases the risk of recessive monogenic 
      diseases, but it is less certain whether it contributes to the etiology of 
      complex diseases such as schizophrenia. One way to estimate the effects of 
      inbreeding is to examine the association between disease diagnosis and 
      genome-wide autozygosity estimated using runs of homozygosity (ROH) in 
      genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Using data for schizophrenia 
      from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (n = 21,868), Keller et al. (2012) 
      estimated that the odds of developing schizophrenia increased by approximately 
      17% for every additional percent of the genome that is autozygous (β = 16.1, 
      CI(β) = [6.93, 25.7], Z = 3.44, p = 0.0006). Here we describe replication results 
      from 22 independent schizophrenia case-control datasets from the Psychiatric 
      Genomics Consortium (n = 39,830). Using the same ROH calling thresholds and 
      procedures as Keller et al. (2012), we were unable to replicate the significant 
      association between ROH burden and schizophrenia in the independent PGC phase II 
      data, although the effect was in the predicted direction, and the combined 
      (original + replication) dataset yielded an attenuated but significant 
      relationship between Froh and schizophrenia (β = 4.86,CI(β) = [0.90,8.83],Z = 
      2.40,p = 0.02). Since Keller et al. (2012), several studies reported inconsistent 
      association of ROH burden with complex traits, particularly in case-control data. 
      These conflicting results might suggest that the effects of autozygosity are 
      confounded by various factors, such as socioeconomic status, education,

AB  - Gene expression variation largely contributes to phenotypic diversity and 
      constructing pan-transcriptome is considered necessary for species with complex 
      genomes. However, the regulation mechanisms and functional consequences of 
      pan-transcriptome is unexplored systematically. By analyzing RNA-seq data from 
      368 maize diverse inbred lines, we identified almost one-third nuclear genes 
      under expression presence and absence variation, which tend to play regulatory 
      roles and are likely regulated by distant eQTLs. The ePAV was directly used as 
      "genotype" to perform GWAS for 15 agronomic phenotypes and 526 metabolic traits 
      to efficiently explore the associations between transcriptomic and phenomic 
      variations. Through a modified assembly strategy, 2,355 high-confidence novel 
      sequences with total 1.9 Mb lengths were found absent within reference genome. 
      Ten randomly selected novel sequences were fully validated with genomic PCR, 
      including another two NBS_LRR candidates potentially affect flavonoids and 
      disease-resistance. A simulation analysis suggested that the pan-transcriptome of 
      the maize whole kernel is approaching a maximum value of 63,000 genes, and 
      through developing two test-cross populations and surveying several most 
      important yield traits, the dispensable genes were shown to contribute to 
      heterosis. Novel perspectives and resources to discover maize quantitative trait 
      variations were provided to better understand the kernel regulation networks and 
      to enhance maize breeding.

TI  - Stroke Investigative Research and Education Network: Community Engagement and 
      Outreach Within Phenomics Core.
PG  - 82S-92S
LID - 10.1177/1090198116634082 [doi]
AB  - Stroke is the leading cause of neurological hospital admissions in sub-Saharan 
      Africa (SSA) and the second leading cause of death globally. The Stroke 
      Investigative Research and Education Network seeks to comprehensively 
      characterize the genomic, sociocultural, economic, and behavioral risk factors 
      for stroke and to build effective teams for research to address and decrease the 
      burden of stroke and other noncommunicable diseases in SSA. One of the first 
      steps to address this goal is to effectively engage the communities that suffer 
      the high burden of disease. The purpose of this article is to describe plans to 
      elucidate information about knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practices about 
      stroke and genomics from patients, caregivers, and local leaders, to recruit 
      participation in research activities and dissemination of ongoing results, as 
      well as to facilitate research uptake and impact within the broader communities 
      of scientists, health professionals, policy makers, and others. We describe the 
      (a) study sites and their communities; (b) plans for community advisory boards, 
      focus groups, and surveys; (c) methods for data management in REDCap database; 
      (d) analyses of qualitative data; (e) evaluation of community and public 
      engagement across multiple sites and research teams in SSA and the United States; 
      (f) use of RE-AIM for presentation of evaluation data; and (g) community 
      indicators of success. This is the first of its kind public outreach engagement 
      initiative to evaluate stroke and genomics in SSA, and has implications as a 
      model for assessment in other high-stroke risk populations.

TI  - Development of a Pipeline for Exploratory Metabolic Profiling of Infant Urine.
PG  - 3432-40
LID - 10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00234 [doi]
AB  - Numerous metabolic profiling pipelines have been developed to characterize the 
      composition of human biofluids and tissues, the vast majority of these being for 
      studies in adults. To accommodate limited sample volume and to take into account 
      the compositional differences between adult and infant biofluids, we developed 
      and optimized sample handling and analytical procedures for studying urine from 
      newborns. A robust pipeline for metabolic profiling using NMR spectroscopy was 
      established, encompassing sample collection, preparation, spectroscopic 
      measurement, and computational analysis. Longitudinal samples were collected from 
      five infants from birth until 14 months of age. Methods of extraction and effects 
      of freezing and sample dilution were assessed, and urinary contaminants from 
      breakdown of polymers in a range of diapers and cotton wool balls were identified 
      and compared, including propylene glycol, acrylic acid, and tert-butanol. 
      Finally, assessment of urinary profiles obtained over the first few weeks of life 
      revealed a dramatic change in composition, with concentrations of phenols, amino 
      acids, and betaine altering systematically over the first few months of life. 
      Therefore, neonatal samples require more stringent standardization of 
      experimental design, sample handling, and analysis compared to that of adult 
      samples to accommodate the variability and limited sample volume.

TI  - Dietary omega-6 fatty acid replacement selectively impairs cardiac functional 
      recovery after ischemia in female (but not male) rats.
PG  - H768-80
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00690.2015 [doi]
AB  - A definitive understanding of the role of dietary lipids in determining 
      cardioprotection (or cardiodetriment) has been elusive. Randomized trial findings 
      have been variable and sex specificity of dietary interventions has not been 
      determined. In this investigation the sex-selective cardiac functional effects of 
      three diets enriched by omega-3 or omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) or 
      enriched to an equivalent extent in saturated fatty acid components were examined 
      in rats after an 8-wk treatment period. In females the myocardial membrane 
      omega-6:omega-3 PUFA ratio was twofold higher than males in the omega-6 diet 
      replacement group. In diets specified to be high in omega-3 PUFA or in saturated 
      fat, this sex difference was not apparent. Isolated cardiomyocyte and heart 
      Langendorff perfusion experiments were performed, and molecular measures of cell 
      viability were assessed. Under basal conditions the contractile performance of 
      omega-6 fed female cardiomyocytes and hearts was reduced compared with males. 
      Omega-6 fed females exhibited impaired systolic resilience after ischemic insult. 
      This response was associated with increased postischemia necrotic cell damage 
      evaluated by coronary lactate dehydrogenase during reperfusion in omega-6 fed 
      females. Cardiac and myocyte functional parameters were not different between 
      omega-3 and saturated fat dietary groups and within these groups there were no 
      discernible sex differences. Our data provide evidence at both the cardiac and 
      cardiomyocyte levels that dietary saturated fatty acid intake replacement with an 
      omega-6 (but not omega-3) enriched diet has selective adverse cardiac effect in 
      females. This finding has potential relevance in relation to women, cardiac risk, 
      and dietary management.

TI  - Germline PARP4 mutations in patients with primary thyroid and breast cancers.
PG  - 171-9
LID - 10.1530/ERC-15-0359 [doi]
AB  - Germline mutations in the PTEN gene, which cause Cowden syndrome, are known to be 
      one of the genetic factors for primary thyroid and breast cancers; however, PTEN 
      mutations are found in only a small subset of research participants with 
      non-syndrome breast and thyroid cancers. In this study, we aimed to identify 
      germline variants that may be related to genetic risk of primary thyroid and 
      breast cancers. Genomic DNAs extracted from peripheral blood of 14 PTEN WT female 
      research participants with primary thyroid and breast cancers were analyzed by 
      whole-exome sequencing. Gene-based case-control association analysis using the 
      information of 406 Europeans obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project database 
      identified 34 genes possibly associated with the phenotype with P < 1.0 × 10(-3). 
      Among them, rare variants in the PARP4 gene were detected at significant high 
      frequency (odds ratio = 5.2; P = 1.0 × 10(-5)). The variants, G496V and T1170I, 
      were found in six of the 14 study participants (43%) while their frequencies were 
      only 0.5% in controls. Functional analysis using HCC1143 cell line showed that 
      knockdown of PARP4 with siRNA significantly enhanced the cell proliferation, 
      compared with the cells transfected with siControl (P = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier 
      analysis using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), European Genome-phenome Archive 
      (EGA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets showed poor relapse-free 
      survival (P < 0.001, Hazard ratio 1.27) and overall survival (P = 0.006, Hazard 
      ratio 1.41) in a PARP4 low-expression group, suggesting that PARP4 may function 
      as a tumor suppressor. In conclusion, we identified PARP4 as a possible 
      susceptibility gene of primary thyroid and breast cancer.

      Cichlid Fish Dentitions.
PG  - 373-88
LID - 10.1093/icb/icw059 [doi]
AB  - Within vertebrates, teleost fishes provide a rich evolutionary context for 
      studying the mechanisms of dental divergence because of the numerous axes along 
      which their teeth have diverged phenotypically and presumably developmentally. 
      Using both a review of teleost in situ hybridization and de novo transcriptome 
      sequencing in a cichlid fish, we examined whether 341 gene homologs thought to 
      play a role in developing mice teeth are expressed in the tooth-bearing jaws of 
      teleosts. The similarities and putative differences in gene expression documented 
      between the two most commonly used models, zebrafish and cichlids, highlight what 
      can be learned from using a greater diversity of teleost model systems in studies 
      of tooth development. Both types of gene expression analysis also provide 
      substantial evidence for conservation of tooth gene expression from teleosts to 
      mammals as well as between initial and replacement teeth. Additionally, we found 
      that the cichlid oral and pharyngeal jaws share expression for a large percentage 
      of genes that influence tooth development. Our transcriptome analyses also 
      suggest sub-functionalization between gene paralogs expressed in teeth and 
      paralogs expressed in other structures is likely a common pattern across teleost 
      diversity. Teleost dentitions will continue to provide a potent system in which 
      to examine the importance of both gene duplication as well as the conservation of 
      gene expression for phenotypic diversification.

AB  - Head motion reduces data quality of neuroimaging data. In three functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments we demonstrate that people make less 
      head movements under task than resting-state conditions. In Experiment 1, we 
      observed less head motion during a memory encoding task than during the 
      resting-state condition. In Experiment 2, using publicly shared data from the 
      UCLA Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics LA5c Study, we again found less 
      head motion during several active task conditions than during a resting-state 
      condition, although some task conditions also showed comparable motion. In the 
      healthy controls, we found more head motion in men than in women and more motion 
      with increasing age. When comparing clinical groups, we found that patients with 
      a clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia, move more compared to 
      healthy controls or patients with ADHD. Both these experiments had a fixed 
      acquisition order across participants, and we could not rule out that a first or 
      last scan during a session might be particularly prone to more head motion. 
      Therefore, we conducted Experiment 3, in which we collected several task and 
      resting-state fMRI runs with an acquisition order counter-balanced. The results 
      of Experiment 3 show again less head motion during several task conditions than 
      during rest. Together these experiments demonstrate that small head motions occur 
      during MRI even with careful instruction to remain still and fixation with foam 
      pillows, but that head motion is lower when participants are engaged in a 
      cognitive task. These finding may inform the choice of functional runs when 
      studying difficult-to-scan populations, such as children or certain patient 
      populations. Our findings also indicate that differences in head motion 
      complicate direct comparisons of measures of functional neuronal networks between 
      task and resting-state fMRI because of potential differences in data quality. In 
      practice, a task to reduce head motion might be especially useful when acquiring 
      structural MRI data such as T1/T2-weighted and diffusion MRI in research and 
      clinical settings.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of 40,000 individuals identifies two novel loci 
      associated with bipolar disorder.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) is a genetically complex mental illness characterized by 
      severe oscillations of mood and behaviour. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
      have identified several risk loci that together account for a small portion of 
      the heritability. To identify additional risk loci, we performed a two-stage 
      meta-analysis of >9 million genetic variants in 9,784 bipolar disorder patients 
      and 30,471 controls, the largest GWAS of BD to date. In this study, to increase 
      power we used ∼2,000 lithium-treated cases with a long-term diagnosis of BD from 
      the Consortium on Lithium Genetics, excess controls, and analytic methods 
      optimized for markers on the X-chromosome. In addition to four known loci, 
      results revealed genome-wide significant associations at two novel loci: an 
      intergenic region on 9p21.3 (rs12553324, P =  5.87 × 10 (-)  (9); odds ratio 
      (OR) = 1.12) and markers within ERBB2 (rs2517959, P =  4.53 × 10 (-)  (9); 
      OR = 1.13). No significant X-chromosome associations were detected and X-linked 
      markers explained very little BD heritability. The results add to a growing list 
      of common autosomal variants involved in BD and illustrate the power of comparing 
      well-characterized cases to an excess of controls in GWAS.

TI  - Genetic variants associated with response to lithium treatment in bipolar 
      disorder: a genome-wide association study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lithium is a first-line treatment in bipolar disorder, but individual 
      response is variable. Previous studies have suggested that lithium response is a 
      heritable trait. However, no genetic markers of treatment response have been 
      reproducibly identified. METHODS: Here, we report the results of a genome-wide 
      association study of lithium response in 2563 patients collected by 22 
      participating sites from the International Consortium on Lithium Genetics 
      (ConLiGen). Data from common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested 
      for association with categorical and continuous ratings of lithium response. 
      Lithium response was measured using a well established scale (Alda scale). 
      Genotyped SNPs were used to generate data at more than 6 million sites, using 
      standard genomic imputation methods. Traits were regressed against genotype 
      dosage. Results were combined across two batches by meta-analysis. FINDINGS: A 
      single locus of four linked SNPs on chromosome 21 met genome-wide significance 
      criteria for association with lithium response (rs79663003, p=1·37 × 10(-8); 
      rs78015114, p=1·31 × 10(-8); rs74795342, p=3·31 × 10(-9); and rs75222709, 
      p=3·50 × 10(-9)). In an independent, prospective study of 73 patients treated 
      with lithium monotherapy for a period of up to 2 years, carriers of the 
      response-associated alleles had a significantly lower rate of relapse than 
      carriers of the alternate alleles (p=0·03268, hazard ratio 3·8, 95% CI 1·1-13·0). 
      INTERPRETATION: The response-associated region contains two genes for long, 
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), AL157359.3 and AL157359.4. LncRNAs are increasingly 
      appreciated as important regulators of gene expression, particularly in the CNS. 
      Confirmed biomarkers of lithium response would constitute an important step 
      forward in the clinical management of bipolar disorder. Further studies are 
      needed to establish the biological context and potential clinical utility of 
      these findings. FUNDING: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, National Institute of

AB  - High-throughput molecular profiling techniques are routinely generating vast 
      amounts of data for translational medicine studies. Secure access controlled 
      systems are needed to manage, store, transfer and distribute these data due to 
      its personally identifiable nature. The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) was 
      created to facilitate access and management to long-term archival of 
      bio-molecular data. Each data provider is responsible for ensuring a Data Access 
      Committee is in place to grant access to data stored in the EGA. Moreover, the 
      transfer of data during upload and download is encrypted. ELIXIR, a European 
      research infrastructure for life-science data, initiated a project (2016 Human 
      Data Implementation Study) to understand and document the ELIXIR requirements for 
      secure management of controlled-access data. As part of this project, a full 
      ecosystem was designed to connect archived raw experimental molecular profiling 
      data with interpreted data and the computational workflows, using the CTMM 
      Translational Research IT (CTMM-TraIT) infrastructure http://www.ctmm-trait.nl as 
      an example. Here we present the first outcomes of this project, a framework to 
      enable the download of EGA data to a Galaxy server in a secure way. Galaxy 
      provides an intuitive user interface for molecular biologists and 
      bioinformaticians to run and design data analysis workflows. More specifically, 
      we developed a tool -- ega_download_streamer - that can download data securely 
      from EGA into a Galaxy server, which can subsequently be further processed. This 
      tool will allow a user within the browser to run an entire analysis containing 
      sensitive data from EGA, and to make this analysis available for other 
      researchers in a reproducible manner, as shown with a proof of concept study. 
       The tool ega_download_streamer is available in the Galaxy tool shed: 
      https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/yhoogstrate/ega_download_streamer.

AB  - An organism's anatomy is the result of millions of years of interplay between DNA 
      sequence, developmental processes, the environment, and evolutionary forces. The 
      anatomical sciences are consequently highly integrative and interdisciplinary. 
      That said, reaching across all of the relevant disciplines can be a daunting task 
      because scientific publications are produced today at an astounding rate. This 
      manuscript brings together insights from the quantitative genetic analysis of 
      dental variation into the study of human evolutionary odontology within the 
      context of genomics, genetic modularity, and phenomics. It primarily advocates 
      the use of quantitative genetics to not only identify QTLs, but also to assess 
      the patterns of genetic covariance that underlie phenotypic covariance, thereby 
      enabling us to conceptualize phenotypic variation as a reflection of the 
      underlying genetic mechanisms. By highlighting three phenotypes of importance 
      within the study of human evolution (patterning of the dental arcade, enamel 
      thickness, and taurodontism), it is demonstrated how an integrated consideration 
      of quantitative genetics, genomic analyses, and paleontology can bring us to more 
      detailed hypotheses about the evolution of the hominid clade.

TI  - The Longitudinal Course of Schizophrenia Across the Lifespan: Clinical,

AB  - Despite several decades of research, our knowledge of the long-term course of 
      schizophrenia (SZ) is hampered by a lack of homogeneity of both research methods 
      and phenotypic definitions of SZ's course. We provide a comprehensive review of 
      the course of SZ by applying stringent methodological and diagnostic 
      study-selection criteria. We report on positive and negative symptoms, cognition, 
      and findings obtained by neuroimaging. In addition, we perform a meta-analysis of 
      longitudinal studies of cognition in humans. We selected 35 human studies 
      focusing on a narrow SZ phenotype, employing a follow-up duration of six months 
      or more and consistent methodology at the different measurement points. For the 
      meta-analysis on global cognitive change, eight and four studies were used to 
      compare SZ to healthy and psychiatric controls, respectively. We find that the 
      course of SZ is characterized by a constancy or even improvement of positive and 
      negative symptoms and by fairly stable cognitive impairment, reflecting 
      structural frontal and temporal cortical pathology. Progressive changes of the 
      frontal cortex appear to develop in parallel with changes in symptomatology and 
      executive impairment. Despite stable differences in cognition between patients 
      and controls over the time intervals studied, high heterogeneity in the magnitude 
      of effect sizes is present, and age is identified as one of its potential 
      sources. Meta-regression shows these magnitudes to depend on the age at study 
      inclusion. For future research, a combination of longitudinal and cross-sectional 
      research designs is warranted to better account for potential cohort effects.

TI  - A multi-institution evaluation of clinical profile anonymization.
PG  - e131-7
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv154 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is an increasing desire to share de-identified 
      electronic health records (EHRs) for secondary uses, but there are concerns that 
      clinical terms can be exploited to compromise patient identities. Anonymization 
      algorithms mitigate such threats while enabling novel discoveries, but their 
      evaluation has been limited to single institutions. Here, we study how an 
      existing clinical profile anonymization fares at multiple medical centers. 
      METHODS: We apply a state-of-the-artk-anonymization algorithm, withkset to the 
      standard value 5, to the International Classification of Disease, ninth edition 
      codes for patients in a hypothyroidism association study at three medical 
      centers: Marshfield Clinic, Northwestern University, and Vanderbilt University. 
      We assess utility when anonymizing at three population levels: all patients in 1) 
      the EHR system; 2) the biorepository; and 3) a hypothyroidism study. We evaluate 
      utility using 1) changes to the number included in the dataset, 2) number of 
      codes included, and 3) regions generalization and suppression were required. 
      RESULTS: Our findings yield several notable results. First, we show that 
      anonymizing in the context of the entire EHR yields a significantly greater 
      quantity of data by reducing the amount of generalized regions from ∼15% to 
      ∼0.5%. Second, ∼70% of codes that needed generalization only generalized two or 
      three codes in the largest anonymization. CONCLUSIONS: Sharing large volumes of 
      clinical data in support of phenome-wide association studies is possible while 
      safeguarding privacy to the underlying individuals.

TI  - Dual-5α-Reductase Inhibition Promotes Hepatic Lipid Accumulation in Man.
PG  - 103-13
LID - 10.1210/jc.2015-2928 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: 5α-Reductase 1 and 2 (SRD5A1, SRD5A2) inactivate cortisol to 
      5α-dihydrocortisol in addition to their role in the generation of DHT. 
      Dutasteride (dual SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 inhibitor) and finasteride (selective SRD5A2 
      inhibitor) are commonly prescribed, but their potential metabolic effects have 
      only recently been identified. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to provide a detailed 
      assessment of the metabolic effects of SRD5A inhibition and in particular the 
      impact on hepatic lipid metabolism. DESIGN: We conducted a randomized study in 12 
      healthy male volunteers with detailed metabolic phenotyping performed before and 
      after a 3-week treatment with finasteride (5 mg od) or dutasteride (0.5 mg od). 
      Hepatic magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and two-step hyperinsulinemic 
      euglycemic clamps incorporating stable isotopes with concomitant adipose tissue 
      microdialysis were used to evaluate carbohydrate and lipid flux. Analysis of the 
      serum metabolome was performed using ultra-HPLC-mass spectrometry. SETTING: The 
      study was performed in the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Queen 
      Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: 
      Incorporation of hepatic lipid was measured with MRS. RESULTS: Dutasteride, not 
      finasteride, increased hepatic insulin resistance. Intrahepatic lipid increased 
      on MRS after dutasteride treatment and was associated with increased rates of de 
      novo lipogenesis. Adipose tissue lipid mobilization was decreased by dutasteride. 
      Analysis of the serum metabolome demonstrated that in the fasted state, 
      dutasteride had a significant effect on lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Dual-SRD5A 
      inhibition with dutasteride is associated with increased intrahepatic lipid 
      accumulation.

TI  - Population structure and associated phenotypes of Salmonella enterica serovars 
      Derby and Mbandaka overlap with host range.

LID - 15
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Salmonella enterica serovar Derby is frequently isolated from 
      pigs and turkeys whereas serovar Mbandaka is frequently isolated from cattle, 
      chickens and animal feed in the UK. Through comparative genomics, phenomics and 
      mutant construction we previously suggested possible mechanistic reasons why 
      these serovars demonstrate apparently distinct host ranges. Here, we investigate 
      the genetic and phenotypic diversity of these two serovars in the UK. We produce 
      a phylogenetic reconstruction and perform several biochemical assays on isolates 
      of S. Derby and S. Mbandaka acquired from sites across the UK between the years 
      2000 and 2010. RESULTS: We show that UK isolates of S. Mbandaka comprise of one 
      clonal lineage which is adapted to proficient utilisation of metabolites found in 
      soya beans under ambient conditions. We also show that this clonal lineage forms 
      a biofilm at 25 °C, suggesting that this serovar maybe well adapted to survival 
      ex vivo, growing in animal feed. Conversely, we show that S. Derby is made of two 
      distinct lineages, L1 and L2. These lineages differ genotypically and 
      phenotypically, being divided by the presence and absence of SPI-23 and the 
      ability to more proficiently invade porcine jejunum derived cell line IPEC-J2. 
      CONCLUSION: The results of this study lend support to the hypothesis that the 
      differences in host ranges of S. Derby and S. Mbandaka are adaptations to 
      pathogenesis, environmental persistence, as well as utilisation of metabolites 
      abundant in their respective host environments.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci associated 
      with human phenotypes. This approach, however, does not consider the richly 
      diverse and complex environment with which humans interact throughout the life 
      course, nor does it allow for interrelationships between genetic loci and across 
      traits. As we move toward making precision medicine a reality, whereby we make 
      predictions about disease risk based on genomic profiles, we need to identify 
      improved predictive models of the relationship between genome and phenome. 
      Methods that embrace pleiotropy (the effect of one locus on more than one trait), 
      and gene-environment (G×E) and gene-gene (G×G) interactions, will further unveil 
      the impact of alterations in biological pathways and identify genes that are only 
      involved with disease in the context of the environment. This valuable 
      information can be used to assess personal risk and choose the most appropriate 
      medical interventions based on the genotype and environment of an individual, the 
      whole premise of precision medicine.

TI  - Inflammatory pathway network-based drug repositioning and molecular phenomics.
PG  - 2777-84
LID - 10.1039/c6mb00222f [doi]
AB  - Inflammation is a protective biological response to body/tissue damage that 
      involves immune cells, blood vessels and molecular mediators. In this work, we 
      constructed the pathway network of inflammation, including 11 sub-pathways of 
      inflammatory factors. Pathway-based network efficiency and network flux were 
      adopted to evaluate drug efficacy. By using approved and experimentally validated 
      anti-inflammatory drugs as training sets, a predictive model was built to screen 
      potential anti-inflammatory drugs from approved drugs in DrugBank. This drug 
      repositioning approach would bring a fast and cheap way to find new indications 
      for approved drugs. Moreover, molecular phenomics profiles of the expression of 
      inflammatory factors will provide new insight into the drug mechanism of action.

TI  - Assessing a learning process with functional ANOVA estimators of EEG power 
      spectral densities.
PG  - 175-83
LID - 10.1007/s11571-015-9368-7 [doi]
AB  - We propose to assess the process of learning a task using electroencephalographic 
      (EEG) measurements. In particular, we quantify changes in brain activity 
      associated to the progression of the learning experience through the functional 
      analysis-of-variances (FANOVA) estimators of the EEG power spectral density 
      (PSD). Such functional estimators provide a sense of the effect of training in 
      the EEG dynamics. For that purpose, we implemented an experiment to monitor the 
      process of learning to type using the Colemak keyboard layout during a 
      twelve-lessons training. Hence, our aim is to identify statistically significant 
      changes in PSD of various EEG rhythms at different stages and difficulty levels 
      of the learning process. Those changes are taken into account only when a 
      probabilistic measure of the cognitive state ensures the high engagement of the 
      volunteer to the training. Based on this, a series of statistical tests are 
      performed in order to determine the personalized frequencies and sensors at which 
      changes in PSD occur, then the FANOVA estimates are computed and analyzed. Our 
      experimental results showed a significant decrease in the power of [Formula: see 
      text] and [Formula: see text] rhythms for ten volunteers during the learning 
      process, and such decrease happens regardless of the difficulty of the lesson. 
      These results are in agreement with previous reports of changes in PSD being 
      associated to feature binding and memory encoding.

TI  - Conservation and divergence of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase 
      A (cAMP-PKA) pathway in two plant-pathogenic fungi: Fusarium graminearum and 
      F. verticillioides.
PG  - 196-209
LID - 10.1111/mpp.12272 [doi]
AB  - The cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) pathway is a 
      central signalling cascade that transmits extracellular stimuli and governs cell 
      responses through the second messenger cAMP. The importance of cAMP signalling in 
      fungal biology has been well documented and the key conserved components, 
      adenylate cyclase (AC) and the catalytic subunit of PKA (CPKA), have been 
      functionally characterized. However, other genes involved in this signalling 
      pathway and their regulation are not well understood in filamentous fungi. Here, 
      we performed a comparative transcriptomics analysis of AC and CPKA mutants in two 
      closely related fungi: Fusarium graminearum (Fg) and F. verticillioides (Fv). 
      Combining available Fg transcriptomics and phenomics data, we reconstructed the 
      Fg cAMP signalling pathway. We developed a computational program that combines 
      sequence conservation and patterns of orthologous gene expression to facilitate 
      global transcriptomics comparisons between different organisms. We observed 
      highly correlated expression patterns for most orthologues (80%) between Fg and 
      Fv. We also identified a subset of 482 (6%) diverged orthologues, whose 
      expression under all conditions was at least 50% higher in one genome than in the 
      other. This enabled us to dissect the conserved and unique portions of the 
      cAMP-PKA pathway. Although the conserved portions controlled essential functions, 
      such as metabolism, the cell cycle, chromatin remodelling and the oxidative 
      stress response, the diverged portions had species-specific roles, such as the 
      production and detoxification of secondary metabolites unique to each species. 
      The evolution of the cAMP-PKA signalling pathway seems to have contributed 
      directly to fungal divergence and niche adaptation.

TI  - Development of a Rapid Microbore Metabolic Profiling Ultraperformance Liquid 
      Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Approach for High-Throughput Phenotyping 
      Studies.
PG  - 5742-51
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b00038 [doi]
AB  - A rapid gradient microbore ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry (UPLC-MS) method has been developed to provide a high-throughput 
      analytical platform for the metabolic phenotyping of urine from large sample 
      cohorts. The rapid microbore metabolic profiling (RAMMP) approach was based on 
      scaling a conventional reversed-phase UPLC-MS method for urinary profiling from 
      2.1 mm × 100 mm columns to 1 mm × 50 mm columns, increasing the linear velocity 
      of the solvent, and decreasing the gradient time to provide an analysis time of 
      2.5 min/sample. Comparison showed that conventional UPLC-MS and rapid gradient 
      approaches provided peak capacities of 150 and 50, respectively, with the 
      conventional method detecting approximately 19 000 features compared to the 
      ∼6 000 found using the rapid gradient method. Similar levels of repeatability 
      were seen for both methods. Despite the reduced peak capacity and the reduction 
      in ions detected, the RAMMP method was able to achieve similar levels of group 
      discrimination as conventional UPLC-MS when applied to rat urine samples obtained 
      from investigative studies on the effects of acute 2-bromophenol and chronic 
      acetaminophen administration. When compared to a direct infusion MS method of 
      similar analysis time the RAMMP method provided superior selectivity. The RAMMP 
      approach provides a robust and sensitive method that is well suited to 
      high-throughput metabonomic analysis of complex mixtures such as urine combined 
      with a 5-fold reduction in analysis time compared with the conventional UPLC-MS 
      method.

AB  - The scientific literature concerning Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells grows 
      annually due to the importance of CHO cells in industrial bioprocessing of 
      therapeutics. In an effort to start to catalogue the breadth of CHO phenotypes, 
      or phenome, we present the CHO bibliome. This bibliographic compilation covers 
      all published CHO cell studies from 1995 to 2015, and each study is classified by 
      the types of phenotypic and bioprocess data contained therein. Using data from 
      selected studies, we also present a quantitative meta-analysis of bioprocess 
      characteristics across diverse culture conditions, yielding novel insights and 
      addressing the validity of long held assumptions. Specifically, we show that 
      bioprocess titers can be predicted using indicator variables derived from viable 
      cell density, viability, and culture duration. We further identified a positive 
      correlation between the cumulative viable cell density (VCD) and final titer, 
      irrespective of cell line, media, and other bioprocess parameters. In addition, 
      growth rate was negatively correlated with performance attributes, such as VCD 
      and titer. In summary, despite assumptions that technical diversity among studies 
      and opaque publication practices can limit research re-use in this field, we show 
      that the statistical analysis of diverse legacy bioprocess data can provide 
      insight into bioprocessing capabilities of CHO cell lines used in industry. The 
      CHO bibliome can be accessed at http://lewislab.ucsd.edu/cho-bibliome/.

      phenomics research is based primarily on European populations; hence it is an 
      important challenge to expand it to consider other population groups. One 
      approach is to utilize data from EMR databases that contain patient data from 
      diverse demographics and ancestries. The implications of this racial 
      underrepresentation of data can be profound regarding effects on the healthcare 
      delivery and actionability. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first 
      attempt to perform comparative, population-scale analyses of disease networks 
      across three different populations, namely Caucasian (EA), African American (AA) 
      and Hispanic/Latino (HL). RESULTS: We compared susceptibility profiles and 
      temporal connectivity patterns for 1988 diseases and 37 282 disease pairs 
      represented in a clinical population of 1 025 573 patients. Accordingly, we 
      revealed appreciable differences in disease susceptibility, temporal patterns, 
      network structure and underlying disease connections between EA, AA and HL 
      populations. We found 2158 significantly comorbid diseases for the EA cohort, 
      3265 for AA and 672 for HL. We further outlined key disease pair associations 
      unique to each population as well as categorical enrichments of these pairs. 
      Finally, we identified 51 key 'hub' diseases that are the focal points in the 
      race-centric networks and of particular clinical importance. Incorporating 
      race-specific disease comorbidity patterns will produce a more accurate and 
      complete picture of the disease landscape overall and could support more precise 
      understanding of disease relationships and patient management towards improved 
      clinical outcomes. CONTACTS: rong.chen@mssm.edu or joel.dudley@mssm.edu

TI  - Symptom profiles and illness course among Anabaptist and Non-Anabaptist adults 
      with major mood disorders.
PG  - 21
LID - 21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anabaptists comprise large and growing Amish and Mennonite 
      populations with a unique genetic heritage and cultural background. Little is 
      known about the symptoms and course of major mood disorders in Anabaptists. Even 
      less is known about the impact of potential moderators on symptom severity and 
      course. METHODS: A sample of Amish and Mennonite participants with bipolar, 
      recurrent unipolar, or schizoaffective bipolar disorder (n = 155) were 
      systematically evaluated with a well-validated instrument. Cases were compared 
      with non-Anabaptist participants (n = 155) matched for age, sex, and psychiatric 
      diagnosis and evaluated by the same methods. RESULTS: Despite substantial 
      cultural differences, the profile of manic and depressive symptoms during illness 
      episodes did not significantly differ between the two groups. Alcohol use 
      disorder (AUD) was significantly less frequent among Anabaptists, and was 
      associated with more major depressive episodes and more hospitalizations for 
      major depression in Anabaptist, but not non-Anabaptist participants. Lifetime 
      history of head injury showed a trend toward association with more episodes of 
      major depression in both Anabaptist and non-Anabaptist groups that did not 
      withstand multiple test correction. CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of a highly 
      heritable psychiatric illness such as bipolar disorder does not differ in cases 
      drawn from genetically unique Anabaptist populations. However, alcohol 
      comorbidity, head injury, and their effects on illness course suggest some 
      differences that deserve further investigation.

TI  - Circadian genes and lithium response in bipolar disorders: associations with 
      PPARGC1A (PGC-1α) and RORA.
PG  - 660-8
LID - 10.1111/gbb.12306 [doi]
AB  - Preliminary studies suggest that lithium (Li) response might be associated with 
      some circadian gene polymorphisms, we therefore performed a pharmacogenetic study 
      on the core clock genes in two independent samples suffering from bipolar 
      disorder (BD) and thoroughly characterized for their Li response. Two independent 
      Caucasian samples (165 and 58 bipolar patients) treated with Li were selected 
      from samples recruited in a French multicenter study and assessed for their Li 
      response using the Alda scale. The two samples were genotyped using the Human660 
      (H660) and OmniExpress (OE) BeadChips and gene-based association analyses of 22 
      core clock genes were conducted. In the first sample (H660 chip), the RAR-related 
      orphan receptor-a gene (RORA) and the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor 
      Gamma, Coactivator 1 Alpha gene (PPARGC1A or PGC-1α) were significantly 
      associated with the Li response (empirical P-value = 0.0015 and 0.04, 
      respectively), and remained significant only for RORA after Bonferroni 
      correction. In the second sample (OE chip), PPARGC1A was significantly associated 
      with the Li response (empirical P-value = 0.04), and did not remain significant 
      after Bonferroni correction. PPARGC1A is a master regulator of mitochondrial 
      function and a key component of the endogenous clock that stimulates the 
      expression of Bmal1 and Rev-erb-alpha through coactivation of RORA. Although the 
      observed associations deserve further replication and investigation, our results 
      suggest genetic associations between Li response and these two close biological 
      partners: PPARGC1A and RORA involved in circadian rhythms and bioenergetics 
      processes in Li response.

AB  - Bioconversion processes of organic acid or acid hydrolysis of raw material for 
      microbial metabolism often suffer limitations as a result of microbial 
      sensitivity in low-pH conditions. We adopted a three-step method called RAndom 
      Insertional-deletional Strand Exchange mutagenesis (RAISE) to engineer the 
      components of global regulator Sigma D factor (RpoD) of Escherichia coli to 
      improve its acid tolerance. The best strain Mutant VII was identified from random 
      mutagenesis libraries based on the growth performance, which exhibited much 
      higher growth rate than the control (0.22h(-1) vs. 0.15h(-1)) at pH as low as 
      3.17. Combined transcriptome and phenome analysis of E. coli was carried out to 
      better understand the global effects of RpoD on the regulatory networks. Our 
      analysis showed that 95 (2.1%) of all E. coli genes were induced and 178 (4.0%) 
      genes were repressed, including those for trehalose biosynthesis, nucleotides 
      biosynthesis, carbon metabolism, amino acid utilization, except for acid 
      resistance. Also regulated were the master regulators (ArcA, EvgA, H-NS and RpoS) 
      and gene/operon-specific transcription factors (GadX, GadW, AppY, YdeO, KdgR). 
      These results demonstrated that RpoD acts as global regulator in the growth phase 
      of E. coli and consequently improves acid tolerances.

      clustering and its application to photosynthesis.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Phenomics is the study of the properties and behaviors of organisms 
      (i.e. their phenotypes) on a high-throughput scale. New computational tools are 
      needed to analyze complex phenomics data, which consists of multiple 
      traits/behaviors that interact with each other and are dependent on external 
      factors, such as genotype and environmental conditions, in a way that has not 
      been well studied. RESULTS: We deployed an efficient framework for partitioning 
      complex and high dimensional phenotype data into distinct functional groups. To 
      achieve this, we represented measured phenotype data from each genotype as a 
      cloud-of-points, and developed a novel non-parametric clustering algorithm to 
      cluster all the genotypes. When compared with conventional clustering approaches, 
      the new method is advantageous in that it makes no assumption about the 
      parametric form of the underlying data distribution and is thus particularly 
      suitable for phenotype data analysis. We demonstrated the utility of the new 
      clustering technique by distinguishing novel phenotypic patterns in both 
      synthetic data and a high-throughput plant photosynthetic phenotype dataset. We 
      biologically verified the clustering results using four Arabidopsis chloroplast 
      mutant lines. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Software is available at

AB  - Whereas domestication of livestock, pets, and crops is well documented, it is 
      still unclear to what extent microbes associated with the production of food have 
      also undergone human selection and where the plethora of industrial strains 
      originates from. Here, we present the genomes and phenomes of 157 industrial 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts. Our analyses reveal that today's industrial 
      yeasts can be divided into five sublineages that are genetically and 
      phenotypically separated from wild strains and originate from only a few 
      ancestors through complex patterns of domestication and local divergence. 
      Large-scale phenotyping and genome analysis further show strong industry-specific 
      selection for stress tolerance, sugar utilization, and flavor production, while 
      the sexual cycle and other phenotypes related to survival in nature show decay, 
      particularly in beer yeasts. Together, these results shed light on the origins, 
      evolutionary history, and phenotypic diversity of industrial yeasts and provide a 
      resource for further selection of superior strains. PAPERCLIP.

TI  - Fast and Accurate Microplate Method (Biolog MT2) for Detection of Fusarium 
      Fungicides Resistance/Sensitivity.
PG  - 489
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2016.00489 [doi]
LID - 489
AB  - The need for finding fungicides against Fusarium is a key step in the chemical 
      plant protection and using appropriate chemical agents. Existing, conventional 
      methods of evaluation of Fusarium isolates resistance to fungicides are costly, 
      time-consuming and potentially environmentally harmful due to usage of high 
      amounts of potentially toxic chemicals. Therefore, the development of fast, 
      accurate and effective detection methods for Fusarium resistance to fungicides is 
      urgently required. MT2 microplates (Biolog(TM)) method is traditionally used for 
      bacteria identification and the evaluation of their ability to utilize different 
      carbon substrates. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no reports 
      concerning the use of this technical tool to determine fungicides resistance of 
      the Fusarium isolates. For this reason, the objectives of this study are to 
      develop a fast method for Fusarium resistance to fungicides detection and to 
      validate the effectiveness approach between both traditional hole-plate and MT2 
      microplates assays. In presented study MT2 microplate-based assay was evaluated 
      for potential use as an alternative resistance detection method. This was carried 
      out using three commercially available fungicides, containing following active 
      substances: triazoles (tebuconazole), benzimidazoles (carbendazim) and 
      strobilurins (azoxystrobin), in six concentrations (0, 0.0005, 0.005, 0.05, 0.1, 
      0.2%), for nine selected Fusarium isolates. In this study, the particular 
      concentrations of each fungicides was loaded into MT2 microplate wells. The wells 
      were inoculated with the Fusarium mycelium suspended in PM4-IF inoculating fluid. 
      Before inoculation the suspension was standardized for each isolates into 75% of 
      transmittance. Traditional hole-plate method was used as a control assay. The 
      fungicides concentrations in control method were the following: 0, 0.0005, 0.005, 
      0.05, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50%. Strong relationships between MT2 microplate 
      and traditional hole-plate methods were observed regarding to the detection of 
      Fusarium resistance to various fungicides and their concentrations. The 
      tebuconazole was most potent, providing increased efficiency in the growth 
      inhibition of all tested isolates. Almost all among tested isolates were 
      resistant to azoxystrobin-based fungicide. Overall, the MT2 microplates method 
      was effective and timesaving, alternative method for determining Fusarium 
      resistance/sensitivity to fungicides, compering to traditional hole-plate 
      approach.

LID - 914
AB  - We extend a model of ion and water transport through a root to describe transport 
      along and through a root exhibiting a complexity of differentiation zones. 
      Attention is focused on convective and diffusive transport, both radially and 
      longitudinally, through different root tissue types (radial differentiation) and 
      root developmental zones (longitudinal differentiation). Model transport 
      parameters are selected to mimic the relative abilities of the different tissues 
      and developmental zones to transport water and ions. For each transport scenario 
      in this extensive simulations study, we quantify the optimal 3D flow path taken 
      by water and ions, in response to internal barriers such as the Casparian strip 
      and suberin lamellae. We present and discuss both transient and steady state 
      results of ion concentrations as well as ion and water fluxes. We find that the 
      peak in passive uptake of ions and water occurs at the start of the 
      differentiation zone. In addition, our results show that the level of 
      transpiration has a significant impact on the distribution of ions within the 
      root as well as the rate of ion and water uptake in the differentiation zone, 
      while not impacting on transport in the elongation zone. From our model results 
      we infer information about the active transport of ions in the different 
      developmental zones. In particular, our results suggest that any uptake measured 
      in the elongation zone under steady state conditions is likely to be due to 
      active transport.

      times per day for photosynthesis, growth and spectral reflectance at eight 
      wavelengths. Using this unprecedented phenotyping capacity, we have been able to 
      detect significant genetic differences between Arabidopsis accessions for all 
      traits measured, across both temporal and environmental scales. The high 
      frequency of measurement allowed us to observe that heritability was not only 
      trait specific, but for some traits was also time specific. CONCLUSIONS: Such 
      continuous real-time non-destructive phenotyping will allow detailed genetic and 
      physiological investigations of the kinetics of plant homeostasis and 
      development. The success and ultimate outcome of a breeding program will depend 
      greatly on the genetic variance which is sampled. Our observation of temporal 
      fluctuations in trait heritability shows that the moment of measurement can have 
      lasting consequences. Ultimately such phenomic level technologies will provide 
      more dynamic insights into plant physiology, and the necessary data for the omics 
      revolution to reach its full potential.

TI  - Linking Dynamic Phenotyping with Metabolite Analysis to Study Natural Variation 
      in Drought Responses of Brachypodium distachyon.
PG  - 1751
LID - 1751
AB  - Drought is an important environmental stress limiting the productivity of major 
      crops worldwide. Understanding drought tolerance and possible mechanisms for 
      improving drought resistance is therefore a prerequisite to develop 
      drought-tolerant crops that produce significant yields with reduced amounts of 
      water. Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) is a key model species for cereals, 
      forage grasses, and energy grasses. In this study, initial screening of a 
      Brachypodium germplasm collection consisting of 138 different ecotypes exposed to 
      progressive drought, highlighted the natural variation in morphology, biomass 
      accumulation, and responses to drought stress. A core set of ten ecotypes, 
      classified as being either tolerant, susceptible or intermediate, in response to 
      drought stress, were exposed to mild or severe (respectively, 15 and 0% soil 
      water content) drought stress and phenomic parameters linked to growth and color 
      changes were assessed. When exposed to severe drought stress, phenotypic data and 
      metabolite profiling combined with multivariate analysis revealed a remarkable 
      consistency in separating the selected ecotypes into their different pre-defined 
      drought tolerance groups. Increases in several metabolites, including for the 
      phytohormones jasmonic acid and salicylic acid, and TCA-cycle intermediates, were 
      positively correlated with biomass yield and with reduced yellow pixel counts; 
      suggestive of delayed senescence, both key target traits for crop improvement to 
      drought stress. While metabolite analysis also separated ecotypes into the 
      distinct tolerance groupings after exposure to mild drought stress, similar 
      analysis of the phenotypic data failed to do so, confirming the value of 
      metabolomics to investigate early responses to drought stress. The results 
      highlight the potential of combining the analyses of phenotypic and metabolic 
      responses to identify key mechanisms and markers associated with drought 
      tolerance in both the Brachypodium model plant as well as agronomically important 
      crops.

TI  - Metabolism of Fructophilic Lactic Acid Bacteria Isolated from the Apis mellifera 
      L. Bee Gut: Phenolic Acids as External Electron Acceptors.
PG  - 6899-6911
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02194-16 [doi]
AB  - Fructophilic lactic acid bacteria (FLAB) are strongly associated with the 
      gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) of Apis mellifera L. worker bees due to the 
      consumption of fructose as a major carbohydrate. Seventy-seven presumptive lactic 
      acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from GITs of healthy A. mellifera L. adults, 
      which were collected from 5 different geographical locations of the Apulia region 
      of Italy. Almost all of the isolates showed fructophilic tendencies: these 
      isolates were identified as Lactobacillus kunkeei (69%) or Fructobacillus 
      fructosus (31%). A high-throughput phenotypic microarray targeting 190 carbon 
      sources was used to determine that 83 compounds were differentially consumed. 
      Phenotyping grouped the strains into two clusters, reflecting growth performance. 
      The utilization of phenolic acids, such as p-coumaric, caffeic, syringic, or 
      gallic acids, as electron acceptors was investigated in fructose-based medium. 
      Almost all FLAB strains showed tolerance to high phenolic acid concentrations. 
      p-Coumaric acid and caffeic acid were consumed by all FLAB strains through 
      reductases or decarboxylases. Syringic and gallic acids were partially 
      metabolized. The data collected suggest that FLAB require external electron 
      acceptors to regenerate NADH. The use of phenolic acids as external electron 
      acceptors by the 4 FLAB showing the highest phenolic acid reductase activity was 
      investigated in glucose-based medium supplemented with p-coumaric acid. Metabolic 
      responses observed through a phenotypic microarray suggested that FLAB may use 
      p-coumaric acid as an external electron acceptor, enhancing glucose dissimilation 
      but less efficiently than other external acceptors such as fructose or pyruvic 
      acid.IMPORTANCE Fructophilic lactic acid bacteria (FLAB) remain to be fully 
      explored. This study intends to link unique biochemical features of FLAB with 
      their habitat. The quite unique FLAB phenome within the group lactic acid 
      bacteria (LAB) may have practical relevance in food fermentations. The FLAB 
      phenome may have implications for the levels of hexose metabolism products in 
      fermented foods, as well as food probiotication. Due to the harsh conditions of 
      honeybees' GITs, these bacteria had to develop specific physiological and 
      biochemical characteristics, such as tolerance to phenolic acids. The screening 
      of FLAB strains based on metabolic pathways involving phenolic acids may allow 
      the selection of starter cultures with both technological and functional 
      beneficial attributes. Bioconversion of phenolic compounds may contribute to the 
      aroma attributes and biofunctionality of fermented foods. Thus, the selection of 
      FLAB strains as starter cultures with specific enzymatic activities involving 
      phenolic acids may have a promising role in food fermentations.

TI  - Fortune telling: metabolic markers of plant performance.
PG  - 158
LID - 158
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the last decade, metabolomics has emerged as a powerful diagnostic 
      and predictive tool in many branches of science. Researchers in microbes, animal, 
      food, medical and plant science have generated a large number of targeted or 
      non-targeted metabolic profiles by using a vast array of analytical methods 
      (GC-MS, LC-MS, (1)H-NMR….). Comprehensive analysis of such profiles using adapted 
      statistical methods and modeling has opened up the possibility of using single or 
      combinations of metabolites as markers. Metabolic markers have been proposed as 
      proxy, diagnostic or predictors of key traits in a range of model species and 
      accurate predictions of disease outbreak frequency, developmental stages, food 
      sensory evaluation and crop yield have been obtained. AIM OF REVIEW: (i) To 
      provide a definition of plant performance and metabolic markers, (ii) to 
      highlight recent key applications involving metabolic markers as tools for 
      monitoring or predicting plant performance, and (iii) to propose a workable and 
      cost-efficient pipeline to generate and use metabolic markers with a special 
      focus on plant breeding. KEY MESSAGE: Using examples in other models and domains, 
      the review proposes that metabolic markers are tending to complement and possibly 
      replace traditional molecular markers in plant science as efficient estimators of 
      performance.

TI  - PRECOG: a tool for automated extraction and visualization of fitness components 
      in microbial growth phenomics.
PG  - 249
LID - 10.1186/s12859-016-1134-2 [doi]
LID - 249
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phenomics is a field in functional genomics that records variation in 
      organismal phenotypes in the genetic, epigenetic or environmental context at a 
      massive scale. For microbes, the key phenotype is the growth in population size 
      because it contains information that is directly linked to fitness. Due to 
      technical innovations and extensive automation our capacity to record complex and 
      dynamic microbial growth data is rapidly outpacing our capacity to dissect and 
      visualize this data and extract the fitness components it contains, hampering 
      progress in all fields of microbiology. RESULTS: To automate visualization, 
      analysis and exploration of complex and highly resolved microbial growth data as 
      well as standardized extraction of the fitness components it contains, we 
      developed the software PRECOG (PREsentation and Characterization Of Growth-data). 
      PRECOG allows the user to quality control, interact with and evaluate microbial 
      growth data with ease, speed and accuracy, also in cases of non-standard growth 
      dynamics. Quality indices filter high- from low-quality growth experiments, 
      reducing false positives. The pre-processing filters in PRECOG are 
      computationally inexpensive and yet functionally comparable to more complex 
      neural network procedures. We provide examples where data calibration, project 
      design and feature extraction methodologies have a clear impact on the estimated 
      growth traits, emphasising the need for proper standardization in data analysis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: PRECOG is a tool that streamlines growth data pre-processing, 
      phenotypic trait extraction, visualization, distribution and the creation of vast 
      and informative phenomics databases.

AB  - Drought is one of the major abiotic stresses reducing crop yield. Since the 
      discovery of plant microRNAs (miRNAs), considerable progress has been made in 
      clarifying their role in plant responses to abiotic stresses, including drought. 
      miR827 was previously reported to confer drought tolerance in transgenic 
      Arabidopsis. We examined barley (Hordeum vulgare L. 'Golden Promise') plants 
      over-expressing miR827 for plant performance under drought. Transgenic plants 
      constitutively expressing CaMV-35S::Ath-miR827 and drought-inducible 
      Zm-Rab17::Hv-miR827 were phenotyped by non-destructive imaging for growth and 
      whole plant water use efficiency (WUE(wp)). We observed that the growth, WUE(wp), 
      time to anthesis and grain weight of transgenic barley plants expressing 
      CaMV-35S::Ath-miR827 were negatively affected in both well-watered and 
      drought-treated growing conditions compared with the wild-type plants. In 
      contrast, transgenic plants over-expressing Zm-Rab17::Hv-miR827 showed improved 
      WUE(wp) with no growth or reproductive timing change compared with the wild-type 
      plants. The recovery of Zm-Rab17::Hv-miR827 over-expressing plants also improved 
      following severe drought stress. Our results suggest that Hv-miR827 has the 
      potential to improve the performance of barley under drought and that the choice 
      of promoter to control the timing and specificity of miRNA expression is 
      critical.

TI  - Differential expression of microRNAs and potential targets under drought stress 
      in barley.
PG  - 11-24
LID - 10.1111/pce.12764 [doi]
AB  - Drought is a crucial environmental constraint limiting crop production in many 
      parts of the world. microRNA (miRNA) based gene regulation has been shown to act 
      in several pathways, including crop response to drought stress. Sequence based 
      profiling and computational analysis have revealed hundreds of miRNAs and their 
      potential targets in different plant species under various stress conditions, but 
      few have been biologically verified. In this study, 11 candidate miRNAs were 
      tested for their expression profiles in barley. Differences in accumulation of 
      only four miRNAs (Ath-miR169b, Osa-miR1432, Hv-miRx5 and Hv-miR166b/c) were 
      observed between drought-treated and well-watered barley in four genotypes. miRNA 
      targets were predicted using degradome analysis of two, different genotypes, and 
      genotype-specific target cleavage was observed. Inverse correlation of mature 
      miRNA accumulation with miRNA target transcripts was also genotype dependent 
      under drought treatment. Drought-responsive miRNAs accumulated predominantly in 
      mesophyll tissues. Our results demonstrate genotype-specific miRNA regulation 
      under drought stress and evidence for their role in mediating expression of 
      target genes for abiotic stress response in barley.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomic analyses have suggested that the LPA gene and its associated 
      plasma biomarker, lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), represent a causal risk factor for 
      coronary heart disease (CHD). As such, lowering Lp(a) levels has emerged as a 
      therapeutic strategy. Beyond target identification, human genetics may contribute 
      to the development of new therapies by defining the full spectrum of beneficial 
      and adverse consequences and by developing a dose-response curve of target 
      perturbation. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to establish the full 
      phenotypic impact of LPA gene variation and to estimate a dose-response curve 
      between genetically altered plasma Lp(a) and risk for CHD. METHODS: We leveraged 
      genetic variants at the LPA gene from 3 data sources: individual-level data from 
      112,338 participants in the U.K. Biobank; summary association results from 
      large-scale genome-wide association studies; and LPA gene sequencing results from 
      case subjects with CHD and control subjects free of CHD. RESULTS: One SD 
      genetically lowered Lp(a) level was associated with a 29% lower risk of CHD (odds 
      ratio [OR]: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69 to 0.73), a 31% lower risk 
      of peripheral vascular disease (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.80), a 13% lower risk 
      of stroke (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.96), a 17% lower risk of heart failure 
      (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.94), and a 37% lower risk of aortic stenosis (OR: 
      0.63; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.83). We observed no association with 31 other disorders, 
      including type 2 diabetes and cancer. Variants that led to gain of LPA gene 
      function increased the risk for CHD, whereas those that led to loss of gene 
      function reduced the CHD risk. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond CHD, genetically lowered Lp(a) 
      levels are associated with a lower risk of peripheral vascular disease, stroke, 
      heart failure, and aortic stenosis. As such, pharmacological lowering of plasma 
      Lp(a) may influence a range of atherosclerosis-related diseases.

AB  - Basmati rice is preferred internationally because of its appealing taste, mouth 
      feel and aroma. Pusa Basmati 1121 (PB1121) is a widely grown variety known for 
      its excellent grain and cooking quality in the international and domestic market. 
      It contributes approximately USD 3 billion to India's forex earning annually by 
      being the most traded variety. However, PB1121 is highly susceptible to bacterial 
      blight (BB) disease. A novel BB resistance gene Xa38 was incorporated in PB1121 
      from donor parent PR114-Xa38 using a modified marker-assisted backcross breeding 
      (MABB) scheme. Phenotypic selection prior to background selection was 
      instrumental in identifying the novel recombinants with maximum recovery of 
      recurrent parent phenome. The strategy was effective in delimiting the linkage 
      drag to <0.5 mb upstream and <1.9 mb downstream of Xa38 with recurrent parent 
      genome recovery upto 96.9% in the developed NILs. The NILs of PB1121 carrying 
      Xa38 were compared with PB1121 NILs carrying xa13 + Xa21 (developed earlier in 
      our lab) for their resistance to BB. Both NILs showed resistance against the Xoo 
      races 1, 2, 3 and 6. Additionally, Xa38 also resisted Xoo race 5 to which 
      xa13 + Xa21 was susceptible. The PB1121 NILs carrying Xa38 gene will provide 
      effective control of BB in the Basmati growing region.

AB  - Phenomic experiments are carried out in large-scale plant phenotyping facilities 
      that acquire a large number of pictures of hundreds of plants simultaneously. 
      With the aid of automated image processing, the data are converted into 
      genotype-feature matrices that cover many consecutive days of development. Here, 
      we explore the possibility of predicting the biomass of the fully grown plant 
      from early developmental stage image-derived features. We performed phenomic 
      experiments on 195 inbred and 382 hybrid maizes varieties and followed their 
      progress from 16 days after sowing (DAS) to 48 DAS with 129 image-derived 
      features. By applying sparse regression methods, we show that 73% of the variance 
      in hybrid fresh weight of fully-grown plants is explained by about 20 features at 
      the three-leaf-stage or earlier. Dry weight prediction explained over 90% of the 
      variance. When phenomic features of parental inbred lines were used as predictors 
      of hybrid biomass, the proportion of variance explained was 42 and 45%, for fresh 
      weight and dry weight models consisting of 35 and 36 features, respectively. 
      These models were very robust, showing only a small amount of variation in 
      performance over the time scale of the experiment. We also examined mid-parent 
      heterosis in phenomic features. Feature heterosis displayed a large degree of 
      variance which resulted in prediction performance that was less robust than 
      models of either parental or hybrid predictors. Our results show that phenomic 
      prediction is a viable alternative to genomic and metabolic prediction of hybrid 
      performance. In particular, the utility of early-stage parental lines is very 
      encouraging.

TI  - Carbohydrate and fatty acid perturbations in the amniotic fluid of the recipient 
      twin of pregnancies complicated by twin-twin transfusion syndrome in relation to 
      treatment and fetal cardiovascular risk.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) complicates 15% of 
      monochorionic twin pregnancies, often being associated with recipient cardiac 
      dysfunction. Untreated, it has a fetal mortality rate of at least 90%; although 
      treatment by fetoscopic laser coagulation significantly improves prognosis. 
      Measurement of recipient amniotic fluid metabolites, such as cardiac Troponin T 
      and atrial natriuretic polypeptide, correlate with cardiac function in this 
      fetus. The aim of this study is to describe the amniotic fluid metabolomic 
      profile in TTTS, relate this to fetal recipient cardiac function and assess the 
      metabolomic changes induced by fetoscopic laser coagulation. METHODS: Prospective 
      single centre cohort study. The metabolomics profile of the amniotic fluid from 
      the recipient sac of TTTS pregnancies was assessed using ultra high performance 
      liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Profiles were compared pre- and 
      post-laser coagulation and related to fetal recipient cardiac function, as 
      assessed using Doppler ultrasound within 4 h of treatment. RESULTS: Eleven 
      metabolites had significant associations with recipient fetal right and left 
      ventricular myocardial performance index pre-laser. 200 metabolites in recipient 
      amniotic fluid demonstrated a change in relative concentrations when comparing 
      pre- and post-laser coagulation (p < 0.005). The most prominent change is in the 
      balance of carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolic profile contributing to fetal or 
      placental energy metabolism. These changes were also associated with the 
      echocardiographic measures of recipient cardiac function. DISCUSSION: Changes in 
      carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolic profiles are noted in recipients with 
      cardiac dysfunction, and further changes are noted after treatment. Validation 
      and investigation may identify targets for potential pharmacological treatment.

PG  - 759-68
LID - 10.1210/jc.2015-3780 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common complex genetic disease. It 
      is characterized by hyperandrogenism, gonadotropin secretory changes, polycystic 
      ovarian morphology, and insulin resistance. The etiology of PCOS remains unknown, 
      but modern genetic approaches, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), 
      Mendelian randomization, and next-generation sequencing, promise to identify the 
      pathways that are primarily disrupted. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The literature on 
      PCOS, including the author's research, is discussed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Recent 
      genetic analyses are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable progress has been made 
      mapping PCOS susceptibility genes. GWAS have implicated gonadotropin secretion 
      and action as important primary defects in disease pathogenesis in European and 
      Han Chinese PCOS cohorts, respectively. European women with the National 
      Institutes of Health and Rotterdam phenotypes as well as those with self-reported 
      PCOS have some gene regions in common, such as chromosome 11p14.1 region 
      containing the FSH B polypeptide (FSHB) gene, suggesting shared genetic 
      susceptibility. Several chromosomal signals are significant in both Han Chinese 
      and European PCOS cohorts, suggesting that the susceptibility genes in these 
      regions are evolutionarily conserved. In addition, GWAS have suggested that 
      DENND1A, epidermal growth factor signaling, and DNA repair pathways play a role 
      in PCOS pathogenesis. Only a small amount of the heritability of PCOS is 
      accounted for by the common susceptibility variants mapped so far. Future studies 
      should clarify the contribution of rare genetic variants and epigenetic factors 
      to the PCOS phenotype. Furthermore, Mendelian randomization can be used to 
      clarify causal relationships, and phenome-wide association studies can provide 
      insight into health risks associated with PCOS susceptibility variants.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite substantial research progress in concurrent 
      diseases, for instance comorbidities involving anxiety state (AS) and mitral 
      valve disorders (MVD), the current measures and care are limited and no consensus 
      about their association has yet been reached. Hence, this study aims to analyze 
      the prevalence and association between AS and MVD among Taiwanese population. 
      METHODS: We employed phenome-wide association study (PWAS) portal to investigate 
      the association between AS and MVD using claim data of Taiwan's National Health 
      Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) from year 2000 to 2002. Association strength 
      between AS and MVD was analyzed among overall age and gender groups. RESULTS: We 
      found an overall stronger association between AS and MVD, which was significantly 
      higher in younger age group (OR 15, 95% CI 14.82-16.88) than in the elderly age 
      group (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.76-2.24). Also, the study reveals a higher incidence of 
      co-occurrence in females than males, particularly in age group of 40-49. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results showing considerable strength of association 
      between AS and MVD, this study suggests the necessity of MVD assessment in all 
      patients with AS, particularly in younger females. Moreover, we also propose 
      psychotherapeutic as well as pharmacologic intervention for comorbidity-based 
      pathologies to better the quality care for high-need Taiwanese population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetics of depression has been explored in genome-wide 
      association studies that focused on either major depressive disorder or 
      depressive symptoms with mostly negative findings. A broad depression phenotype 
      including both phenotypes has not been tested previously using a genome-wide 
      association approach. We aimed to identify genetic polymorphisms significantly 
      associated with a broad phenotype from depressive symptoms to major depressive 
      disorder. METHODS: We analyzed two prior studies of 70,017 participants of 
      European ancestry from general and clinical populations in the discovery stage. 
      We performed a replication meta-analysis of 28,328 participants. Single 
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability and genetic correlations were 
      calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression. Discovery and 
      replication analyses were performed using a p-value-based meta-analysis. Lifetime 
      major depressive disorder and depressive symptom scores were used as the outcome 
      measures. RESULTS: The SNP-based heritability of major depressive disorder was 
      0.21 (SE = 0.02), the SNP-based heritability of depressive symptoms was 0.04 (SE 
      = 0.01), and their genetic correlation was 1.001 (SE = 0.2). We found one 
      genome-wide significant locus related to the broad depression phenotype 
      (rs9825823, chromosome 3: 61,082,153, p = 8.2 × 10(-9)) located in an intron of 
      the FHIT gene. We replicated this SNP in independent samples (p = .02) and the 
      overall meta-analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts (1.0 × 10(-9)). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This large study identified a new locus for depression. Our results 
      support a continuum between depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder. A 
      phenotypically more inclusive approach may help to achieve the large sample sizes 
      needed to detect susceptibility loci for depression.

TI  - Automated Detection of Retinal Cell Nuclei in 3D Micro-CT Images of Zebrafish 
      using Support Vector Machine Classification.

AB  - Our group is developing a method to examine biological specimens in cellular 
      detail using synchrotron microCT. The method can acquire 3D images of tissue at 
      micrometer-scale resolutions, allowing for individual cell types to be visualized 
      in the context of the entire specimen. For model organism research, this tool 
      will enable the rapid characterization of tissue architecture and cellular 
      morphology from every organ system. This characterization is critical for 
      proposed and ongoing "phenome" projects that aim to phenotype whole-organism 
      mutants and diseased tissues from different organisms including humans. With the 
      envisioned collection of hundreds to thousands of images for a phenome project, 
      it is important to develop quantitative image analysis tools for the automated 
      scoring of organism phenotypes across organ systems. Here we present a first step 
      towards that goal, demonstrating the use of support vector machines (SVM) in 
      detecting retinal cell nuclei in 3D images of wild-type zebrafish. In addition, 
      we apply the SVM classifier on a mutant zebrafish to examine whether SVMs can be 
      used to capture phenotypic differences in these images. The long-term goal of 
      this work is to allow cellular and tissue morphology to be characterized 
      quantitatively for many organ systems, at the level of the whole-organism.

AB  - Plants are constantly exposed to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses that 
      reduce their fitness and performance. At the molecular level, the perception of 
      extracellular stimuli and the subsequent activation of defense responses require 
      a complex interplay of signaling cascades, in which protein phosphorylation plays 
      a central role. Several studies have shown that some members of the Leucine-Rich 
      Repeat Receptor-Like Kinase (LRR-RLK) family are involved in stress and 
      developmental pathways. We report here a systematic analysis of the role of the 
      members of this gene family by mutant phenotyping in the monocotyledon model 
      plant rice, Oryza sativa. We have then targeted 176 of the ∼320 LRR-RLK genes 
      (55.7%) and genotyped 288 mutant lines. Position of the insertion was confirmed 
      in 128 lines corresponding to 100 LRR-RLK genes (31.6% of the entire family). All 
      mutant lines harboring homozygous insertions have been screened for phenotypes 
      under normal conditions and under various abiotic stresses. Mutant plants have 
      been observed at several stages of growth, from seedlings in Petri dishes to 
      flowering and grain filling under greenhouse conditions. Our results show that 37 
      of the LRR-RLK rice genes are potential targets for improvement especially in the 
      generation of abiotic stress tolerant cereals.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms involved in the side effects of fatty acid amide hydrolase 
      inhibitors: a structural phenomics approach to proteome-wide cellular off-target 
      deconvolution and disease association.
PG  - 16023
LID - 10.1038/npjsba.2016.23 [doi]
AB  - Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a promising therapeutic target for the 
      treatment of pain and CNS disorders. However, the development of potent and safe 
      FAAH inhibitors is hindered by their off-target mediated side effect that leads 
      to brain cell death. Its physiological off-targets and their associations with 
      phenotypes may not be characterized using existing experimental and computational 
      techniques as these methods fail to have sufficient proteome coverage and/or 
      ignore native biological assemblies (BAs; i.e., protein quaternary structures). 
      To understand the mechanisms of the side effects from FAAH inhibitors and other 
      drugs, we develop a novel structural phenomics approach to identifying the 
      physiological off-targets binding profile in the cellular context and on a 
      structural proteome scale, and investigate the roles of these off-targets in 
      impacting human physiology and pathology using text mining-based phenomics 
      analysis. Using this integrative approach, we discover that FAAH inhibitors may 
      bind to the dimerization interface of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) and several other 
      BAs, and thus disrupt their cellular functions. Specifically, the malfunction of 
      the NMDAR is associated with a wide spectrum of brain disorders that are directly 
      related to the observed side effects of FAAH inhibitors. This finding is 
      consistent with the existing literature, and provides testable hypotheses for 
      investigating the molecular origin of the side effects of FAAH inhibitors. Thus, 
      the in silico method proposed here, which can for the first time predict 
      proteome-wide drug interactions with cellular BAs and link BA-ligand interaction 
      with clinical outcomes, can be valuable in off-target screening. The development 
      and application of such methods will accelerate the development of more safe and 
      effective therapeutics.

TI  - Non-targeted UHPLC-MS metabolomic data processing methods: a comparative 
      investigation of normalisation, missing value imputation, transformation and 
      scaling.
PG  - 93
LID - 93
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The generic metabolomics data processing workflow is constructed 
      with a serial set of processes including peak picking, quality assurance, 
      normalisation, missing value imputation, transformation and scaling. The 
      combination of these processes should present the experimental data in an 
      appropriate structure so to identify the biological changes in a valid and robust 
      manner. OBJECTIVES: Currently, different researchers apply different data 
      processing methods and no assessment of the permutations applied to UHPLC-MS 
      datasets has been published. Here we wish to define the most appropriate data 
      processing workflow. METHODS: We assess the influence of normalisation, missing 
      value imputation, transformation and scaling methods on univariate and 
      multivariate analysis of UHPLC-MS datasets acquired for different mammalian 
      samples. RESULTS: Our studies have shown that once data are filtered, missing 
      values are not correlated with m/z, retention time or response. Following an 
      exhaustive evaluation, we recommend PQN normalisation with no missing value 
      imputation and no transformation or scaling for univariate analysis. For PCA we 
      recommend applying PQN normalisation with Random Forest missing value imputation, 
      glog transformation and no scaling method. For PLS-DA we recommend PQN 
      normalisation, KNN as the missing value imputation method, generalised logarithm 
      transformation and no scaling. These recommendations are based on searching for 
      the biologically important metabolite features independent of their measured 
      abundance. CONCLUSION: The appropriate choice of normalisation, missing value 
      imputation, transformation and scaling methods differs depending on the data 
      analysis method and the choice of method is essential to maximise the biological 
      derivations from UHPLC-MS datasets.

AB  - Beginning in the early 2000s, the accumulation of biospecimens linked to 
      electronic health records (EHRs) made possible genome-phenome studies (i.e., 
      comparative analyses of genetic variants and phenotypes) using only data 
      collected as a by-product of typical health care. In addition to disease and 
      trait genetics, EHRs proved a valuable resource for analyzing pharmacogenetic 
      traits and developing reverse genetics approaches such as phenome-wide 
      association studies (PheWASs). PheWASs are designed to survey which of many 
      phenotypes may be associated with a given genetic variant. PheWAS methods have 
      been validated through replication of hundreds of known genotype-phenotype 
      associations, and their use has differentiated between true pleiotropy and 
      clinical comorbidity, added context to genetic discoveries, and helped define 
      disease subtypes, and may also help repurpose medications. PheWAS methods have 
      also proven to be useful with research-collected data. Future efforts that 
      integrate broad, robust collection of phenotype data (e.g., EHR data) with 
      purpose-collected research data in combination with a greater understanding of 
      EHR data will create a rich resource for increasingly more efficient and detailed 
      genome-phenome analysis to usher in new discoveries in precision medicine.

TI  - Methodology for High-Throughput Field Phenotyping of Canopy Temperature Using 
      Airborne Thermography.

AB  - Lower canopy temperature (CT), resulting from increased stomatal conductance, has 
      been associated with increased yield in wheat. Historically, CT has been measured 
      with hand-held infrared thermometers. Using the hand-held CT method on large 
      field trials is problematic, mostly because measurements are confounded by 
      temporal weather changes during the time required to measure all plots. The 
      hand-held CT method is laborious and yet the resulting heritability low, thereby 
      reducing confidence in selection in large scale breeding endeavors. We have 
      developed a reliable and scalable crop phenotyping method for assessing CT in 
      large field experiments. The method involves airborne thermography from a manned 
      helicopter using a radiometrically-calibrated thermal camera. Thermal image data 
      is acquired from large experiments in the order of seconds, thereby enabling 
      simultaneous measurement of CT on potentially 1000s of plots. Effects of temporal 
      weather variation when phenotyping large experiments using hand-held infrared 
      thermometers are therefore reduced. The method is designed for cost-effective and 
      large-scale use by the non-technical user and includes custom-developed software 
      for data processing to obtain CT data on a single-plot basis for analysis. 
      Broad-sense heritability was routinely >0.50, and as high as 0.79, for airborne 
      thermography CT measured near anthesis on a wheat experiment comprising 768 plots 
      of size 2 × 6 m. Image analysis based on the frequency distribution of 
      temperature pixels to remove the possible influence of background soil did not 
      improve broad-sense heritability. Total image acquisition and processing time was 
      ca. 25 min and required only one person (excluding the helicopter pilot). The 
      results indicate the potential to phenotype CT on large populations in genetics 
      studies or for selection within a plant breeding program.

AB  - Databases of organismal traits that aggregate information from one or multiple 
      sources can be leveraged for large-scale analyses in biology. Yet the differences 
      among these data streams and how well they capture trait diversity have never 
      been explored. We present the first analysis of the differences between 
      phenotypes captured in free text of descriptive publications ('monographs') and 
      those used in phylogenetic analyses ('matrices'). We focus our analysis on 
      osteological phenotypes of the limbs of four extinct vertebrate taxa critical to 
      our understanding of the fin-to-limb transition. We find that there is low 
      overlap between the anatomical entities used in these two sources of phenotype 
      data, indicating that phenotypes represented in matrices are not simply a subset 
      of those found in monographic descriptions. Perhaps as expected, compared to 
      characters found in matrices, phenotypes in monographs tend to emphasize 
      descriptive and positional morphology, be somewhat more complex, and relate to 
      fewer additional taxa. While based on a small set of focal taxa, these 
      qualitative and quantitative data suggest that either source of phenotypes alone 
      will result in incomplete knowledge of variation for a given taxon. As a broader 
      community develops to use and expand databases characterizing organismal trait 
      diversity, it is important to recognize the limitations of the data sources and 
      develop strategies to more fully characterize variation both within species and 
      across the tree of life.

AB  - With the development of platforms enabling the integration and use of phenome, 
      genome, and exposome data in the context of international research, data 
      management challenges are increasing, and scalable solutions for cross border and 
      cross domain semantic interoperability need to be developed. Reusing routinely 
      collected clinical data, especially, requires computable portable phenotype 
      algorithms running across different electronic health record (EHR) products and 
      healthcare systems. We propose a framework for describing and comparing mediation 
      platforms enabling cross border phenotype identification within federated EHRs. 
      This framework was used to describe the experience gained during the EHR4CR 
      project and the evaluation of the platform developed for accessing semantically 
      equivalent data elements across 11 European participating EHR systems from 5 
      countries. Developers of semantic interoperability platforms are beginning to 
      address a core set of requirements in order to reach the goal of developing cross 
      border semantic integration of data.

AB  - Understanding and improving the productivity and robustness of plant 
      photosynthesis requires high-throughput phenotyping under environmental 
      conditions that are relevant to the field. Here we demonstrate the dynamic 
      environmental photosynthesis imager (DEPI), an experimental platform for 
      integrated, continuous, and high-throughput measurements of photosynthetic 
      parameters during plant growth under reproducible yet dynamic environmental 
      conditions. Using parallel imagers obviates the need to move plants or sensors, 
      reducing artifacts and allowing simultaneous measurement on large numbers of 
      plants. As a result, DEPI can reveal phenotypes that are not evident under 
      standard laboratory conditions but emerge under progressively more dynamic 
      illumination. We show examples in mutants of Arabidopsis of such "emergent 
      phenotypes" that are highly transient and heterogeneous, appearing in different 
      leaves under different conditions and depending in complex ways on both 
      environmental conditions and plant developmental age. These emergent phenotypes 
      appear to be caused by a range of phenomena, suggesting that such previously 
      unseen processes are critical for plant responses to dynamic environments.

TI  - Reconsidering plant memory: Intersections between stress recovery, RNA turnover, 
      and epigenetics.
PG  - e1501340

LID - e1501340
AB  - Plants grow in dynamic environments where they can be exposed to a multitude of 
      stressful factors, all of which affect their development, yield, and, ultimately, 
      reproductive success. Plants are adept at rapidly acclimating to stressful 
      conditions and are able to further fortify their defenses by retaining memories 
      of stress to enable stronger or more rapid responses should an environmental 
      perturbation recur. Indeed, one mechanism that is often evoked regarding 
      environmental memories is epigenetics. Yet, there are relatively few examples of 
      such memories; neither is there a clear understanding of their duration, 
      considering the plethora of stresses in nature. We propose that this field would 
      benefit from investigations into the processes and mechanisms enabling recovery 
      from stress. An understanding of stress recovery could provide fresh insights 
      into when, how, and why environmental memories are created and regulated. Stress 
      memories may be maladaptive, hindering recovery and affecting development and 
      potential yield. In some circumstances, it may be advantageous for plants to 
      learn to forget. Accordingly, the recovery process entails a balancing act 
      between resetting and memory formation. During recovery, RNA metabolism, 
      posttranscriptional gene silencing, and RNA-directed DNA methylation have the 
      potential to play key roles in resetting the epigenome and transcriptome and in 
      altering memory. Exploration of this emerging area of research is becoming ever 
      more tractable with advances in genomics, phenomics, and high-throughput 
      sequencing methodology that will enable unprecedented profiling of 
      high-resolution stress recovery time series experiments and sampling of large 
      natural populations.

AB  - The use of controlled, structured vocabularies (ontologies) has become a critical 
      tool for scientists in the post-genomic era of massive datasets. Adoption and 
      integration of common vocabularies and annotation practices enables cross-species 
      comparative analyses and increases data sharing and reusability. The Plant 
      Ontology (PO; http://www.plantontology.org/ ) describes plant anatomy, 
      morphology, and the stages of plant development, and offers a database of plant 
      genomics annotations associated to the PO terms. The scope of the PO has grown 
      from its original design covering only rice, maize, and Arabidopsis, and now 
      includes terms to describe all green plants from angiosperms to green algae.This 
      chapter introduces how the PO and other related ontologies are constructed and 
      organized, including languages and software used for ontology development, and 
      provides an overview of the key features. Detailed instructions illustrate how to 
      search and browse the PO database and access the associated annotation data. 
      Users are encouraged to provide input on the ontology through the online term 
      request form and contribute datasets for integration in the PO database.

TI  - Leaf Growth Response to Mild Drought: Natural Variation in Arabidopsis Sheds 
      Light on Trait Architecture.
PG  - 2417-2434
AB  - Plant growth and crop yield are negatively affected by a reduction in water 
      availability. However, a clear understanding of how growth is regulated under 
      nonlethal drought conditions is lacking. Recent advances in genomics, phenomics, 
      and transcriptomics allow in-depth analysis of natural variation. In this study, 
      we conducted a detailed screening of leaf growth responses to mild drought in a 
      worldwide collection of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. The genetic architecture 
      of the growth responses upon mild drought was investigated by subjecting the 
      different leaf growth phenotypes to genome-wide association mapping and by 
      characterizing the transcriptome of young developing leaves. Although no major 
      effect locus was found to be associated with growth in mild drought, the 
      transcriptome analysis delivered further insight into the natural variation of 
      transcriptional responses to mild drought in a specific tissue. Coexpression 
      analysis indicated the presence of gene clusters that co-vary over different 
      genetic backgrounds, among others a cluster of genes with important regulatory 
      functions in the growth response to osmotic stress. It was found that the 
      occurrence of a mild drought stress response in leaves can be inferred with high 
      accuracy across accessions based on the expression profile of 283 genes. A 
      genome-wide association study on the expression data revealed that trans 
      regulation seems to be more important than cis regulation in the transcriptional 
      response to environmental perturbations.

PG  - S70-4
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000243 [doi]
AB  - Modern multianalyte "omics" technologies allow for the identification of 
      molecular signatures that confer significantly more information than measurement 
      of a single parameter as typically used in current medical diagnostics. 
      Proteomics and metabolomics bioanalytical assays capture a large set of proteins 
      and metabolites in body fluids, cells, or tissues and, complementing genomics, 
      assess the phenome. Proteomics and metabolomics contribute to the development of 
      novel predictive clinical biomarkers in transplantation in 2 ways: they can be 
      used to generate a diagnostic fingerprint or they can be used to discover 
      individual proteins and metabolites of diagnostic potential. Much fewer 
      metabolomics than proteomics biomarker studies in transplant patients have been 
      reported, and, in contrast to proteomics discovery studies, new lead metabolite 
      markers have yet to emerge. Most clinical proteomics studies have been discovery 
      studies. Several of these studies have assessed diagnostic sensitivity and 
      specificity. Nevertheless, none of these newly discovered protein biomarkers have 
      yet been implemented in clinical decision making in transplantation. The 
      currently most advanced markers discovered in proteomics studies in transplant 
      patients are the chemokines CXCL-9 and CXCL-10, which have successfully been 
      validated in larger multicenter trials in kidney transplant patients. These 
      chemokines can be measured using standard immunoassay platforms, which should 
      facilitate clinical implementation. Based on the published evidence, it is 
      reasonable to expect that these chemokine markers can help guiding and 
      individualizing immunosuppressive regimens, may be able to predict acute and 
      chronic T-cell-mediated and antibody-mediated rejection, and may be useful tools 
      for risk stratification of kidney transplant patients.

AB  - In this article we propose a novel tool that takes an initial segmented image and 
      returns a more accurate segmentation that accurately captures sharp features such 
      as leaf tips, twists and axils. Our algorithm utilizes basic a-priori information 
      about the shape of plant leaves and local image orientations to fit active 
      contour models to important plant features that have been missed during the 
      initial segmentation. We compare the performance of our approach with three 
      state-of-the-art segmentation techniques, using three error metrics. The results 
      show that leaf tips are detected with roughly one half of the original error, 
      segmentation accuracy is almost always improved and more than half of the leaf 
      breakages are corrected.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of fear to other 
      auras and to gender and age using a large database. METHODS: The Epilepsy 
      Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP) is a multicenter, multicontinental cross-sectional 
      study in which ictal symptomatology and other data were ascertained in a 
      standardized series of questionnaires then corroborated by epilepsy specialists. 
      Auras were classified into subgroups of symptoms, with ictal fear, panic, or 
      anxiety as a single category. RESULTS: Of 536 participants with focal epilepsy, 
      72 were coded as having ictal fear/panic/anxiety. Reviewing raw patient 
      responses, 12 participants were deemed not to have fear, and 24 had inadequate 
      data, leaving 36 (7%) of 512 with definite ictal fear. In univariate analyses, 
      fear was significantly associated with auras historically considered temporal 
      lobe in origin, including cephalic, olfactory, and visceral complaints; déjà vu; 
      and derealization. On both univariate and multivariate stepwise analyses, fear 
      was associated with jamais vu and auras with cardiac symptoms, dyspnea, and chest 
      tightening. Expressive aphasia was associated with fear on univariate analysis 
      only, but the general category of aphasias was associated with fear only in the 
      multivariate model. There was no age or gender relationship with fear when 
      compared to the overall population with focal epilepsy that was studied under the 
      EPGP. Patients with ictal fear were more likely to have a right hemisphere 
      seizure focus. CONCLUSIONS: Ictal fear was strongly associated with other auras 
      considered to originate from the limbic system. No relationship of fear with age 
      or gender was observed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease (PD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease without 
      curative drugs. The highly complex and heterogeneous disease mechanisms are still 
      unclear. Detecting novel PD associated genes not only contributes in revealing 
      the disease pathogenesis, but also facilitates discovering new targets for drugs. 
      METHODS: We propose a phenome-based gene prediction strategy to identify 
      disease-associated genes for PD. We integrated multiple disease phenotype 
      networks, a gene functional relationship network, and known PD genes to predict 
      novel candidate genes. Then we investigated the translational potential of the 
      predicted genes in drug discovery. RESULTS: In a cross validation analysis, the 
      average rank for 15 known PD genes is within top 0.8 %. We also tested the 
      algorithm with an independent validation set of 669 PD-associated genes detected 
      by genome-wide association studies. The top ranked genes predicted by our 
      approach are enriched for these validation genes. In addition, our approach 
      prioritized the target genes for FDA-approved PD drugs and the drugs that have 
      been tested for PD in clinical trials. Pathway analysis shows that the 
      prioritized drug target genes are closely associated with PD pathogenesis. The 
      result provides empirical evidence that our computational gene prediction 
      approach identifies novel candidate genes for PD, and has the potential to lead 
      to rapid drug discovery.

AB  - The plant metabolome is characterized by extensive diversity and is often 
      regarded as a bridge between genome and phenome. Here we report metabolic and 
      phenotypic genome-wide studies (mGWAS and pGWAS) in rice grain that, in addition 
      to previous metabolic GWAS in rice leaf and maize kernel, show both distinct and 
      overlapping aspects of genetic control of metabolism within and between species. 
      We identify new candidate genes potentially influencing important metabolic 
      and/or morphological traits. We show that the differential genetic architecture 
      of rice metabolism between different tissues is in part determined by tissue 
      specific expression. Using parallel mGWAS and pGWAS we identify new candidate 
      genes potentially responsible for variation in traits such as grain colour and 
      size, and provide evidence of metabotype-phenotype linkage. Our study 
      demonstrates a powerful strategy for interactive functional genomics and 
      metabolomics in plants, especially the cloning of minor QTLs for complex 
      phenotypic traits.

AB  - Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced growth arrest of hepatoma cells is 
      associated with metabolic disturbance. Our previous study has suggested that DHEA 
      may cause cellular energy drain. It is possible that mitochondrial dysfunction 
      may be mechanistically implicated in DHEA-induced changes in cellular phenotype. 
      Treatment of SK-Hep-1 cells with DHEA caused significant reduction in 
      proliferation, colony formation, and growth in semi-solid medium. Such changes in 
      cellular phenotype were associated with mitochondrial depolarization, increase in 
      mitochondrial mass, and decrease in respiratory activity. Level of reactive 
      oxygen species (ROS) increased in DHEA-treated cells. To explore the mechanistic 
      aspect of DHEA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, we employed SILAC approach to 
      study the changes in the mitoproteome of SK-Hep-1 cells after DHEA treatment. 
      Respiratory chain complex proteins such as NDUFB8 and SDHB were differentially 
      expressed. Of mitochondrial proteins with altered expression, FAST kinase 
      domain-containing protein 2 (FASTKD2) showed significantly reduced expression. 
      Exogenous expression of FASTKD2 in SK-Hep-1 cells increased their resistance to 
      growth-inhibitory effect of DHEA, though it alone did not affect cell growth. 
      FASTKD2 expression partially reversed the effect of DHEA on mitochondria, and 
      reduced DHEA-induced ROS generation. Our results suggest that DHEA induces 
      changes in mitochondrial proteins and respiratory activity, and contributes to 
      growth arrest. FASTKD2 may be an important regulator of mitochondrial physiology, 
      and represent a downstream target for DHEA.

AB  - Phenotype is defined as the state of an organism resulting from interactions 
      between genes, environment, disease, molecular mechanisms, and chance. The 
      purpose of the emerging field of phenomics is to systematically determine and 
      measure phenotypes across biology for the sake of understanding. Phenotypes can 
      affect more than one cell type and life stage, so ideal phenotyping would include 
      the state of every cell type within the context of both tissue architecture and 
      the whole organism at each life stage. In medicine, high-resolution anatomic 
      assessment of phenotype is obtained from histology. Histology's interpretative 
      power, codified by Virchow as cellular pathology, is derived from its ability to 
      discern diagnostic and characteristic cellular changes in diseased tissues. 
      Cellular pathology is observed in every major human disease and relies on the 
      ability of histology to detect cellular change in any cell type due to unbiased 
      pan-cellular staining, even in optically opaque tissues. Our laboratory has shown 
      that histology is far more sensitive than stereomicroscopy for detecting 
      phenotypes in zebrafish mutants. Those studies have also shown that more complete 
      sampling, greater consistency in sample orientation, and the inclusion of 
      phenotypes extending over longer length scales would provide greater coverage of 
      common phenotypes. We are developing technical approaches to achieve an ideal 
      detection of cellular pathology using an improved form of X-ray microtomography 
      that retains the strengths and addresses the weaknesses of histology as a 
      screening tool. We are using zebrafish as a vertebrate model based on the 
      overlaps between zebrafish and mammalian tissue architecture, and a body size 
      small enough to allow whole-organism, volumetric imaging at cellular resolution. 
      Automation of whole-organism phenotyping would greatly increase the value of 
      phenomics. Potential societal benefits would include reduction in the cost of 
      drug development, a reduction in the incidence of unexpected severe drug and 
      environmental toxicity, and more rapid elucidation of the contributions of genes 
      and the environment to phenotypes, including the validation of candidate disease 
      alleles identified in population and personal genetics.

TI  - Metabolic phenotyping for discovery of urinary biomarkers of diet, xenobiotics

AB  - The etiopathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is multifactorial. Adverse 
      blood pressure (BP) is a major independent risk factor for epidemic CVD affecting 
      ~40% of the adult population worldwide and resulting in significant morbidity and 
      mortality. Metabolic phenotyping of biological fluids has proven its application 
      in characterizing low-molecular-weight metabolites providing novel insights into 
      gene-environmental-gut microbiome interaction in relation to a disease state. In 
      this review, we synthesize key results from the INTERnational study of 
      MAcro/micronutrients and blood Pressure (INTERMAP) Study, a cross-sectional 
      epidemiologic study of 4680 men and women aged 40-59 years from Japan, the 
      People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom and the United States. We describe 
      the advancements we have made regarding the following: (1) analytical techniques 
      for high-throughput metabolic phenotyping; (2) statistical analyses for biomarker 
      identification; (3) discovery of unique food-specific biomarkers; and (4) 
      application of metabolome-wide association studies to gain a better understanding 
      into the molecular mechanisms of cross-cultural and regional BP differences.

      hepatitis C after viral clearance: transition at the crossroad of metabolism and 
      immunity.
PG  - 291-302
LID - 10.1007/s00726-016-2360-7 [doi]
AB  - Recovery of amino acid (AA) metabolism and the associated clinical implications 
      in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with sustained virological response (SVR) 
      following anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy remains elusive. A prospective 
      cohort study was conducted on 222 CHC patients with SVR. Eighty-two age-matched 
      male genotype 1 (G1) and G2 patients underwent paired serum metabolomics analyses 
      with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to examine AAs before and 
      24 weeks after anti-HCV therapy. Before anti-HCV therapy, G1 patients had a 
      higher HCV RNA level than G2 patients. Twenty-four weeks post-therapy versus 
      pre-therapy, repeated-measures ANOVA showed that the levels of alanine 
      aminotransferase and most AAs decreased while those of lipids, glutamine and 
      putrescine increased in CHC patients. The methionine sulfoxide/methionine ratio 
      decreased, while the asymmetric dimethylarginine/arginine, glutamine/glutamate, 
      citrulline/arginine, ornithine/arginine, kynurenine/tryptophan, 
      tyrosine/phenylalanine and Fisher's ratios increased. Genotype-specific subgroup 
      analyses showed that valine and serotonin/tyrosine increased in G1 and that 
      kynurenine and tyrosine/phenylalanine increased and sarcosine decreased in G2 
      patients. Viral clearance in CHC patients pan-genotypically restored fuel 
      utilization by decelerating the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Following improvement 
      in liver function, the urea, nitric oxide, methionine, and polyamine cycles were 
      accelerated. The cardiometabolic risk attenuated, but the augmented kynurenine 
      pathway activity could increase the oncogenesis risk. The trends in 
      neurotransmitter formation differed between G1 and G2 patients after SVR. 
      Moreover, the HCV-suppressing effect of valine was evident in G1 patients; with 
      the exception of prostate cancer, the oncogenesis risk increased, particularly in 
      G2 patients, at least within 24 weeks post-anti-HCV therapy.

TI  - Identification of a Bipolar Disorder Vulnerable Gene CHDH at 3p21.1.
PG  - 5166-5176
LID - 10.1007/s12035-016-0041-x [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide analysis (GWA) is an effective strategy to discover extreme effects 
      surpassing genome-wide significant levels in studying complex disorders; however, 
      when sample size is limited, the true effects may fail to achieve genome-wide 
      significance. In such case, there may be authentic results among the pools of 
      nominal candidates, and an alternative approach is to consider nominal candidates 
      but are replicable across different samples. Here, we found that mRNA expression 
      of the choline dehydrogenase gene (CHDH) was uniformly upregulated in the brains 
      of bipolar disorder (BPD) patients compared with healthy controls across 
      different studies. Follow-up genetic analyses of CHDH variants in multiple 
      independent clinical datasets (including 11,564 cases and 17,686 controls) 
      identified a risk SNP rs9836592 showing consistent associations with BPD (P 
      (meta) = 5.72 × 10(-4)), and the risk allele indicated an increased CHDH 
      expression in multiple neuronal tissues (lowest P = 6.70 × 10(-16)). These 
      converging results may identify a nominal but true BPD susceptibility gene CHDH. 
      Further exploratory analysis revealed suggestive associations of rs9836592 with 
      childhood intelligence (P = 0.044) and educational attainment (P = 0.0039), a 
      "proxy phenotype" of general cognitive abilities. Intriguingly, the CHDH gene is 
      located at chromosome 3p21.1, a risk region implicated in previous BPD 
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but CHDH is lying outside of the core 
      GWAS linkage disequilibrium (LD) region, and our studied SNP rs9836592 is ∼1.2 Mb 
      3' downstream of the previous GWAS loci (e.g., rs2251219) with no LD between 
      them; thus, the association observed here is unlikely a reflection of previous 
      GWAS signals. In summary, our results imply that CHDH may play a previously 
      unknown role in the etiology of BPD and also highlight the informative value of 
      integrating gene expression and genetic code in advancing our understanding of 
      its biological basis.

      terms and global understanding on metabolic and regulatory pathways affected by 
      dxr mutant having defects in light response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rice is one of the most important food crops for humans. To improve 
      the agronomical traits of rice, the functions of more than 1,000 rice genes have 
      been recently characterized and summarized. The completed, map-based sequence of 
      the rice genome has significantly accelerated the functional characterization of 
      rice genes, but progress remains limited in assigning functions to all predicted 
      non-transposable element (non-TE) genes, estimated to number 37,000-41,000. 
      RESULTS: The International Rice Functional Genomics Consortium (IRFGC) has 
      generated a huge number of gene-indexed mutants by using mutagens such as T-DNA, 
      Tos17 and Ds/dSpm. These mutants have been identified by 246,566 flanking 
      sequence tags (FSTs) and cover 65 % (25,275 of 38,869) of the non-TE genes in 
      rice, while the mutation ratio of TE genes is 25.7 %. In addition, almost 80 % of 
      highly expressed non-TE genes have insertion mutations, indicating that highly 
      expressed genes in rice chromosomes are more likely to have mutations by mutagens 
      such as T-DNA, Ds, dSpm and Tos17. The functions of around 2.5 % of rice genes 
      have been characterized, and studies have mainly focused on transcriptional and 
      post-transcriptional regulation. Slow progress in characterizing the function of 
      rice genes is mainly due to a lack of clues to guide functional studies or 
      functional redundancy. These limitations can be partially solved by a 
      well-categorized functional classification of FST genes. To create this 
      classification, we used the diverse overviews installed in the MapMan toolkit. 
      Gene Ontology (GO) assignment to FST genes supplemented the limitation of MapMan 
      overviews. CONCLUSION: The functions of 863 of 1,022 known genes can be evaluated 
      by current FST lines, indicating that FST genes are useful resources for 
      functional genomic studies. We assigned 16,169 out of 29,624 FST genes to 34 
      MapMan classes, including major three categories such as DNA, RNA and protein. To 
      demonstrate the MapMan application on FST genes, transcriptome analysis was done 
      from a rice mutant of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) gene 
      with FST. Mapping of 756 down-regulated genes in dxr mutants and their annotation 
      in terms of various MapMan overviews revealed candidate genes downstream of 
      DXR-mediating light signaling pathway in diverse functional classes such as the 
      methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphatepathway (MEP) pathway overview, photosynthesis, 
      secondary metabolism and regulatory overview. This report provides a useful guide 
      for systematic phenomics and further applications to enhance the key agronomic 
      traits of rice.

AB  - Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) has long been associated with the 
      production and export of a diverse range of agricultural commodities. Due to its 
      strategic geographic location, which encompasses a wide range of climates, it is 
      possible to produce almost any crop. The climate diversity in LAC is a major 
      factor in its agricultural potential but this also means climate change 
      represents a real threat to the region. Therefore, LAC farming must prepare and 
      quickly adapt to an environment that is likely to feature long periods of 
      drought, excessive rainfall and extreme temperatures. With the aim of moving 
      toward a more resilient agriculture, LAC scientists have created the Latin 
      American Plant Phenomics Network (LatPPN) which focuses on LAC's economically 
      important crops. LatPPN's key strategies to achieve its main goal are: (1) 
      training of LAC members on plant phenomics and phenotyping, (2) establish 
      international and multidisciplinary collaborations, (3) develop standards for 
      data exchange and research protocols, (4) share equipment and infrastructure, (5) 
      disseminate data and research results, (6) identify funding opportunities and (7) 
      develop strategies to guarantee LatPPN's relevance and sustainability across 
      time. Despite the challenges ahead, LatPPN represents a big step forward toward 
      the consolidation of a common mind-set in the field of plant phenotyping and 
      phenomics in LAC.

TI  - Determining Phenological Patterns Associated with the Onset of Senescence in a 
      Wheat MAGIC Mapping Population.
PG  - 1540
LID - 1540
AB  - The appropriate timing of developmental transitions is critical for adapting many 
      crops to their local climatic conditions. Therefore, understanding the genetic 
      basis of different aspects of phenology could be useful in highlighting 
      mechanisms underpinning adaptation, with implications in breeding for climate 
      change. For bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), the transition from vegetative to 
      reproductive growth, the start and rate of leaf senescence and the relative 
      timing of different stages of flowering and grain filling all contribute to plant 
      performance. In this study we screened under Smart house conditions a large, 
      multi-founder "NIAB elite MAGIC" wheat population, to evaluate the genetic 
      elements that influence the timing of developmental stages in European elite 
      varieties. This panel of recombinant inbred lines was derived from eight parents 
      that are or recently have been grown commercially in the UK and Northern Europe. 
      We undertook a detailed temporal phenotypic analysis under Smart house conditions 
      of the population and its parents, to try to identify known or novel Quantitative 
      Trait Loci associated with variation in the timing of key phenological stages in 
      senescence. This analysis resulted in the detection of QTL interactions with 
      novel traits such the time between "half of ear emergence above flag leaf ligule" 
      and the onset of senescence at the flag leaf as well as traits associated with 
      plant morphology such as stem height. In addition, strong correlations between 
      several traits and the onset of senescence of the flag leaf were identified. This 
      work establishes the value of systematically phenotyping genetically unstructured 
      populations to reveal the genetic architecture underlying morphological variation 
      in commercial wheat.

AB  - Leaf senescence, an indicator of plant age and ill health, is an important 
      phenotypic trait for the assessment of a plant's response to stress. Manual 
      inspection of senescence, however, is time consuming, inaccurate and subjective. 
      In this paper we propose an objective evaluation of plant senescence by color 
      image analysis for use in a high throughput plant phenotyping pipeline. As high 
      throughput phenotyping platforms are designed to capture whole-of-plant features, 
      camera lenses and camera settings are inappropriate for the capture of fine 
      detail. Specifically, plant colors in images may not represent true plant colors, 
      leading to errors in senescence estimation. Our algorithm features a color 
      distortion correction and image restoration step prior to a senescence analysis. 
      We apply our algorithm to two time series of images of wheat and chickpea plants 
      to quantify the onset and progression of senescence. We compare our results with 
      senescence scores resulting from manual inspection. We demonstrate that our 
      procedure is able to process images in an automated way for an accurate 
      estimation of plant senescence even from color distorted and blurred images 
      obtained under high throughput conditions.

AB  - Advances in genotyping technology have, over the past decade, enabled the focused 
      search for common genetic variation associated with human diseases and traits. 
      With the recently increased availability of detailed phenotypic data from 
      electronic health records and epidemiological studies, the impact of one or more 
      genetic variants on the phenome is starting to be characterized both in clinical 
      and population-based settings using phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). 
      These studies reveal a number of challenges that will need to be overcome to 
      unlock the full potential of PheWAS for the characterization of the complex human 
      genome-phenome relationship.

AB  - Research on biotechnology applications for cultural heritage restoration has 
      shown how microorganisms can be efficient at cleaning particularly complex or 
      ingrained substances through the process called "biocleaning". Bacteria are able 
      to synthesize groups of specific enzymes for the degradation of complex materials 
      present on artwork. Biocleaning has been shown to be less hazardous than some 
      traditional mechanical or chemical techniques for the artwork, to be 
      environmentally-friendly and safe for restorers to use. In order to improve our 
      knowledge of the metabolic mechanisms involved in biocleaning, we analyzed the 
      relationship between the genome and phenome of Pseudomonas stutzeri 5190 in order 
      to identify and confirm the benefits and drawbacks of this bacterium used on 
      on-site artwork as a biocleaning agent. Main phenotype microarray (PM) assays 
      showed that P. stutzeri 5190 was able to use: i) 51 of the 190 carbon sources 
      tested, where 32 were used efficiently, among which there were six amino acids 
      (l-proline, l-alanine, d-alanine, l-glutamic acid, l-asparagine and l-glutamine); 
      ii) 74 of the 95 nitrogen sources tested, where 50 compounds were used 
      efficiently, among which were 28 amino acids and the inorganic nitrate and 
      nitrite compounds, supporting the hypothesis of the strain's ability to remove 
      nitrate salt efflorescence from frescoes. Furthermore, high tolerance to osmotic 
      stress, to basic pH and to toxic compounds was revealed by PM. Putative genes 
      compatible with these phenotypes are described.

AB  - Understanding the source of genetic variation in aging and using this variation 
      to define the molecular mechanisms of healthy aging require deep and broad 
      quantification of a host of physiological, morphological, and behavioral 
      endpoints. The murine model is a powerful system in which to understand the 
      relations across age-related phenotypes and to identify research models with 
      variation in life span and health span. The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock 
      Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging has performed broad 
      characterization of aging in genetically diverse laboratory mice and has placed 
      these data, along with data from several other major aging initiatives, into the 
      interactive Mouse Phenome Database. The data may be accessed and analyzed by 
      researchers interested in finding mouse models for specific aging processes, 
      age-related health and disease states, and for genetic analysis of aging 
      variation and trait covariation. We expect that by placing these data in the 
      hands of the aging community that there will be (a) accelerated genetic analyses 
      of aging processes, (b) discovery of genetic loci regulating life span, (c) 
      identification of compelling correlations between life span and susceptibility 
      for age-related disorders, and (d) discovery of concordant genomic loci 
      influencing life span and aging phenotypes between mouse and humans.

TI  - Assay Establishment and Validation of a High-Throughput Screening Platform for 
      Three-Dimensional Patient-Derived Colon Cancer Organoid Cultures.
PG  - 931-41

AB  - The application of patient-derived three-dimensional culture systems as 
      disease-specific drug sensitivity models has enormous potential to connect 
      compound screening and clinical trials. However, the implementation of complex 
      cell-based assay systems in drug discovery requires reliable and robust screening 
      platforms. Here we describe the establishment of an automated platform in 
      384-well format for three-dimensional organoid cultures derived from colon cancer 
      patients. Single cells were embedded in an extracellular matrix by an automated 
      workflow and subsequently self-organized into organoid structures within 4 days 
      of culture before being exposed to compound treatment. We performed validation of 
      assay robustness and reproducibility via plate uniformity and 
      replicate-experiment studies. After assay optimization, the patient-derived 
      organoid platform passed all relevant validation criteria. In addition, we 
      introduced a streamlined plate uniformity study to evaluate patient-derived colon 
      cancer samples from different donors. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of 
      using patient-derived tumor samples for high-throughput assays and their 
      integration as disease-specific models in drug discovery.

TI  - MicrO: an ontology of phenotypic and metabolic characters, assays, and culture 
      media found in prokaryotic taxonomic descriptions.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1186/s13326-016-0060-6 [doi]
LID - 18
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicrO is an ontology of microbiological terms, including prokaryotic 
      qualities and processes, material entities (such as cell components), chemical 
      entities (such as microbiological culture media and medium ingredients), and 
      assays. The ontology was built to support the ongoing development of a natural 
      language processing algorithm, MicroPIE (or, Microbial Phenomics Information 
      Extractor). During the MicroPIE design process, we realized there was a need for 
      a prokaryotic ontology which would capture the evolutionary diversity of 
      phenotypes and metabolic processes across the tree of life, capture the diversity 
      of synonyms and information contained in the taxonomic literature, and relate 
      microbiological entities and processes to terms in a large number of other 
      ontologies, most particularly the Gene Ontology (GO), the Phenotypic Quality 
      Ontology (PATO), and the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI). We 
      thus constructed MicrO to be rich in logical axioms and synonyms gathered from 
      the taxonomic literature. RESULTS: MicrO currently has ~14550 classes (~2550 of 
      which are new, the remainder being microbiologically-relevant classes imported 
      from other ontologies), connected by ~24,130 logical axioms (5,446 of which are 
      new), and is available at (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MicrO.owl) and on the 
      project website at https://github.com/carrineblank/MicrO. MicrO has been 
      integrated into the OBO Foundry Library 
      (http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/micro.html), so that other ontologies can 
      borrow and re-use classes. Term requests and user feedback can be made using 
      MicrO's Issue Tracker in GitHub. We designed MicrO such that it can support the 
      ongoing and future development of algorithms that can leverage the controlled 
      vocabulary and logical inference power provided by the ontology. CONCLUSIONS: By 
      connecting microbial classes with large numbers of chemical entities, material 
      entities, biological processes, molecular functions, and qualities using a dense 
      array of logical axioms, we intend MicrO to be a powerful new tool to increase 
      the computing power of bioinformatics tools such as the automated text mining of 
      prokaryotic taxonomic descriptions using natural language processing. We also 
      intend MicrO to support the development of new bioinformatics tools that aim to 
      develop new connections between microbial phenotypes and genotypes (i.e., the 
      gene content in genomes). Future ontology development will include incorporation 
      of pathogenic phenotypes and prokaryotic habitats.

TI  - Power Analysis and Sample Size Determination in Metabolic Phenotyping.
PG  - 5179-88
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b00188 [doi]
AB  - Estimation of statistical power and sample size is a key aspect of experimental 
      design. However, in metabolic phenotyping, there is currently no accepted 
      approach for these tasks, in large part due to the unknown nature of the expected 
      effect. In such hypothesis free science, neither the number or class of important 
      analytes nor the effect size are known a priori. We introduce a new approach, 
      based on multivariate simulation, which deals effectively with the highly 
      correlated structure and high-dimensionality of metabolic phenotyping data. 
      First, a large data set is simulated based on the characteristics of a pilot 
      study investigating a given biomedical issue. An effect of a given size, 
      corresponding either to a discrete (classification) or continuous (regression) 
      outcome is then added. Different sample sizes are modeled by randomly selecting 
      data sets of various sizes from the simulated data. We investigate different 
      methods for effect detection, including univariate and multivariate techniques. 
      Our framework allows us to investigate the complex relationship between sample 
      size, power, and effect size for real multivariate data sets. For instance, we 
      demonstrate for an example pilot data set that certain features achieve a power 
      of 0.8 for a sample size of 20 samples or that a cross-validated predictivity 
      QY(2) of 0.8 is reached with an effect size of 0.2 and 200 samples. We exemplify 
      the approach for both nuclear magnetic resonance and liquid chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry data from humans and the model organism C. elegans.

TI  - Bandwagons I, too, have known.
PG  - 2323-2332
AB  - Bandwagons come in waves. A plant breeder, just like a surfer, needs to carefully 
      choose which waves to be on. A bandwagon is an idea, activity, or cause that 
      becomes increasingly fashionable as more and more people adopt it. In a 1991 
      article entitled Bandwagons I Have Known, Professor N. W. Simmonds described 
      several bandwagons that he encountered in his career, beginning with induced 
      polyploidy and mutation breeding and ending with the then-new field of 
      biotechnology. This article reviews and speculates about post-1990 bandwagons in 
      plant improvement, including transgenic cultivars, quantitative trait locus (QTL) 
      mapping, association mapping, genomewide (or genomic) selection, phenomics, 
      envirotyping, and genome editing. The life cycle of a bandwagon includes an 
      excitement phase of hype and funding; a realization phase when the initial hype 
      is either tempered or the initial expectations are found to have been too low; 
      and a reality phase when the useful aspects of a bandwagon become part of 
      mainstream thinking and practice, or when an unsuccessful bandwagon is largely 
      abandoned. During the realization phase, a new bandwagon that draws our attention 
      and gives us renewed optimism typically arises. The most popular bandwagons, such 
      as QTL mapping, are those for which the needed experimental resources are 
      accessible, the required technical knowledge and skills can be easily learned, 
      and the outputs can almost always be reported. The favorite bandwagon of any 
      plant breeder has, in one way or another, resulted from Mendel's seminal 
      discoveries 150 years ago. Our community of plant breeders needs to be 
      continually diligent in welcoming new bandwagons, but also in hopping off from 
      those that do not prove useful.

TI  - Male and female hypertrophic rat cardiac myocyte functional responses to ischemic 
      stress and β-adrenergic challenge are different.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1186/s13293-016-0084-8 [doi]
LID - 32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac hypertrophy is the most potent cardiovascular risk factor 
      after age, and relative mortality risk linked with cardiac hypertrophy is greater 
      in women. Ischemic heart disease is the most common form of cardiovascular 
      pathology for both men and women, yet significant differences in incidence and 
      outcomes exist between the sexes. Cardiac hypertrophy and ischemia are frequently 
      occurring dual pathologies. Whether the cellular (cardiomyocyte) mechanisms 
      underlying myocardial damage differ in women and men remains to be determined. In 
      this study, utilizing an in vitro experimental approach, our goal was to examine 
      the proposition that responses of male/female cardiomyocytes to ischemic (and 
      adrenergic) stress may be differentially modulated by the presence of 
      pre-existing cardiac hypertrophy. METHODS: We used a novel normotensive 
      custom-derived hypertrophic heart rat (HHR; vs control strain normal heart rat 
      (NHR)). Cardiomyocyte morphologic and electromechanical functional studies were 
      performed using microfluorimetric techniques involving simulated 
      ischemia/reperfusion protocols. RESULTS: HHR females exhibited pronounced 
      cardiac/cardiomyocyte enlargement, equivalent to males. Under basal conditions, a 
      lower twitch amplitude in female myocytes was prominent in normal but not in 
      hypertrophic myocytes. The cardiomyocyte Ca(2+) responses to β-adrenergic 
      challenge differed in hypertrophic male and female cardiomyocytes, with the 
      accentuated response in males abrogated in females-even while contractile 
      responses were similar. In simulated ischemia, a marked and selective elevation 
      of end-ischemia Ca(2+) in normal female myocytes was completely suppressed in 
      hypertrophic female myocytes-even though all groups demonstrated similar shifts 
      in myocyte contractile performance. After 30 min of simulated reperfusion, the 
      Ca(2+) desensitization characterizing the male response was distinctively absent 
      in female cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cardiac 
      hypertrophy produces dramatically different basal and stress-induced 
      pathophenotypes in female- and male-origin cardiomyocytes. The lower Ca(2+) 
      operational status characteristic of female (vs male) cardiomyocytes comprising 
      normal hearts is not exhibited by myocytes of hypertrophic hearts. After 
      ischemia/reperfusion, availability of activator Ca(2+) is suppressed in female 
      hypertrophic myocytes, whereas sensitivity to Ca(2+) is blunted in male 
      hypertrophic myocytes. These findings demonstrate that selective intervention 
      strategies should be pursued to optimize post-ischemic electromechanical support 
      for male and female hypertrophic hearts.

TI  - Metabolomics enables precision medicine: "A White Paper, Community Perspective".
PG  - 149
LID - 149
AB  - INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND TO METABOLOMICS: Metabolomics is the comprehensive study 
      of the metabolome, the repertoire of biochemicals (or small molecules) present in 
      cells, tissues, and body fluids. The study of metabolism at the global or 
      "-omics" level is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to have a 
      profound impact upon medical practice. At the center of metabolomics, is the 
      concept that a person's metabolic state provides a close representation of that 
      individual's overall health status. This metabolic state reflects what has been 
      encoded by the genome, and modified by diet, environmental factors, and the gut 
      microbiome. The metabolic profile provides a quantifiable readout of biochemical 
      state from normal physiology to diverse pathophysiologies in a manner that is 
      often not obvious from gene expression analyses. Today, clinicians capture only a 
      very small part of the information contained in the metabolome, as they routinely 
      measure only a narrow set of blood chemistry analytes to assess health and 
      disease states. Examples include measuring glucose to monitor diabetes, measuring 
      cholesterol and high density lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein ratio to assess 
      cardiovascular health, BUN and creatinine for renal disorders, and measuring a 
      panel of metabolites to diagnose potential inborn errors of metabolism in 
      neonates. OBJECTIVES OF WHITE PAPER—EXPECTED TREATMENT OUTCOMES AND METABOLOMICS 
      ENABLING TOOL FOR PRECISION MEDICINE: We anticipate that the narrow range of 
      chemical analyses in current use by the medical community today will be replaced 
      in the future by analyses that reveal a far more comprehensive metabolic 
      signature. This signature is expected to describe global biochemical aberrations 
      that reflect patterns of variance in states of wellness, more accurately describe 
      specific diseases and their progression, and greatly aid in differential 
      diagnosis. Such future metabolic signatures will: (1) provide predictive, 
      prognostic, diagnostic, and surrogate markers of diverse disease states; (2) 
      inform on underlying molecular mechanisms of diseases; (3) allow for 
      sub-classification of diseases, and stratification of patients based on metabolic 
      pathways impacted; (4) reveal biomarkers for drug response phenotypes, providing 
      an effective means to predict variation in a subject's response to treatment 
      (pharmacometabolomics); (5) define a metabotype for each specific genotype, 
      offering a functional read-out for genetic variants: (6) provide a means to 
      monitor response and recurrence of diseases, such as cancers: (7) describe the 
      molecular landscape in human performance applications and extreme environments. 
      Importantly, sophisticated metabolomic analytical platforms and informatics tools 
      have recently been developed that make it possible to measure thousands of 
      metabolites in blood, other body fluids, and tissues. Such tools also enable more 
      robust analysis of response to treatment. New insights have been gained about 
      mechanisms of diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders, cardiovascular 
      disease, cancers, diabetes and a range of pathologies. A series of ground 
      breaking studies supported by National Institute of Health (NIH) through the 
      Pharmacometabolomics Research Network and its partnership with the 
      Pharmacogenomics Research Network illustrate how a patient's metabotype at 
      baseline, prior to treatment, during treatment, and post-treatment, can inform 
      about treatment outcomes and variations in responsiveness to drugs (e.g., 
      statins, antidepressants, antihypertensives and antiplatelet therapies). These 
      studies along with several others also exemplify how metabolomics data can 
      complement and inform genetic data in defining ethnic, sex, and gender basis for 
      variation in responses to treatment, which illustrates how pharmacometabolomics 
      and pharmacogenomics are complementary and powerful tools for precision medicine. 
      CONCLUSIONS KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRECISION MEDICINE: 
      Our metabolomics community believes that inclusion of metabolomics data in 
      precision medicine initiatives is timely and will provide an extremely valuable 
      layer of data that compliments and informs other data obtained by these important 
      initiatives. Our Metabolomics Society, through its "Precision Medicine and 
      Pharmacometabolomics Task Group", with input from our metabolomics community at 
      large, has developed this White Paper where we discuss the value and approaches 
      for including metabolomics data in large precision medicine initiatives. This 
      White Paper offers recommendations for the selection of state of-the-art 
      metabolomics platforms and approaches that offer the widest biochemical coverage, 
      considers critical sample collection and preservation, as well as standardization 
      of measurements, among other important topics. We anticipate that our 
      metabolomics community will have representation in large precision medicine 
      initiatives to provide input with regard to sample acquisition/preservation, 
      selection of optimal omics technologies, and key issues regarding data 
      collection, interpretation, and dissemination. We strongly recommend the 
      collection and biobanking of samples for precision medicine initiatives that will 
      take into consideration needs for large-scale metabolic phenotyping studies.

TI  - High-Throughput Phenotyping of Wheat and Barley Plants Grown in Single or Few 
      Rows in Small Plots Using Active and Passive Spectral Proximal Sensing.
LID - 1860
AB  - In the early stages of plant breeding, breeders evaluate a large number of 
      varieties. Due to limited availability of seeds and space, plot sizes may range 
      from one to four rows. Spectral proximal sensors can be used in place of 
      labour-intensive methods to estimate specific plant traits. The aim of this study 
      was to test the performance of active and passive sensing to assess single and 
      multiple rows in a breeding nursery. A field trial with single cultivars of 
      winter barley and winter wheat with four plot designs (single-row, wide 
      double-row, three rows, and four rows) was conducted. A GreenSeeker RT100 and a 
      passive bi-directional spectrometer were used to assess biomass fresh and dry 
      weight, as well as aboveground nitrogen content and uptake. Generally, spectral 
      passive sensing and active sensing performed comparably in both crops. Spectral 
      passive sensing was enhanced by the availability of optimized ratio vegetation 
      indices, as well as by an optimized field of view and by reduced distance 
      dependence. Further improvements of both sensors in detecting the performance of 
      plants in single rows can likely be obtained by optimization of sensor 
      positioning or orientation. The results suggest that even in early selection 
      cycles, enhanced high-throughput phenotyping might be able to assess plant 
      performance within plots comprising single or multiple rows. This method has 
      significant potential for advanced breeding.

AB  - With the implementation of novel automated, high throughput methods and 
      facilities in the last years, plant phenomics has developed into a highly 
      interdisciplinary research domain integrating biology, engineering and 
      bioinformatics. Here we present a dataset of a non-invasive high throughput plant 
      phenotyping experiment, which uses image- and image analysis- based approaches to 
      monitor the growth and development of 484 Arabidopsis thaliana plants (thale 
      cress). The result is a comprehensive dataset of images and extracted 
      phenotypical features. Such datasets require detailed documentation, standardized 
      description of experimental metadata as well as sustainable data storage and 
      publication in order to ensure the reproducibility of experiments, data reuse and 
      comparability among the scientific community. Therefore the here presented 
      dataset has been annotated using the standardized ISA-Tab format and considering 
      the recently published recommendations for the semantical description of plant 
      phenotyping experiments.

AB  - Plant genomics and phenomics represents the most promising tools for accelerating 
      yield gains and overcoming emerging crop productivity bottlenecks. However, 
      accessing this wealth of plant diversity requires the characterization of this 
      material using state-of-the-art genomic, phenomic and molecular technologies and 
      the release of subsequent research data via a long-term stable, open-access 
      portal. Although several international consortia and public resource centres 
      offer services for plant research data management, valuable digital assets 
      remains unpublished and thus inaccessible to the scientific community. Recently, 
      the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research and the German 
      Plant Phenotyping Network have jointly initiated the Plant Genomics and Phenomics 
      Research Data Repository (PGP) as infrastructure to comprehensively publish plant 
      research data. This covers in particular cross-domain datasets that are not being 
      published in central repositories because of its volume or unsupported data 
      scope, like image collections from plant phenotyping and microscopy, unfinished 
      genomes, genotyping data, visualizations of morphological plant models, data from 
      mass spectrometry as well as software and documents.The repository is hosted at 
      Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research using e!DAL as 
      software infrastructure and a Hierarchical Storage Management System as data 
      archival backend. A novel developed data submission tool was made available for 
      the consortium that features a high level of automation to lower the barriers of 
      data publication. After an internal review process, data are published as citable 
      digital object identifiers and a core set of technical metadata is registered at 
      DataCite. The used e!DAL-embedded Web frontend generates for each dataset a 
      landing page and supports an interactive exploration. PGP is registered as 
      research data repository at BioSharing.org, re3data.org and OpenAIRE as valid EU 
      Horizon 2020 open data archive. Above features, the programmatic interface and 
      the support of standard metadata formats, enable PGP to fulfil the FAIR data 
      principles-findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable.Database

AB  - In this article, we present the progress driven by the recent technological 
      advances and new revolutionary massive sequencing technologies in the field of 
      human genetics. We discuss this knowledge in relation with drug response 
      prediction, from the germline genetic variation compiled in the 1000 Genomes 
      Project or in the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, to the phenome-genome 
      archives, the international cancer projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas or 
      the International Cancer Genome Consortium, and the epigenetic variation and its 
      influence in gene expression, including the regulation of drug metabolism. This 
      review is based on the lectures presented by the speakers of the Symposium "Human 
      Genetics: International Projects & New Technologies" from the VII Conference of 
      the Spanish Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Society, held on the 20th and 
      21st of April 2015.

TI  - Large-scale phenome analysis defines a behavioral signature for Huntington's 
      disease genotype in mice.
PG  - 838-44
LID - 10.1038/nbt.3587 [doi]
AB  - Rapid technological advances for the frequent monitoring of health parameters 
      have raised the intriguing possibility that an individual's genotype could be 
      predicted from phenotypic data alone. Here we used a machine learning approach to 
      analyze the phenotypic effects of polymorphic mutations in a mouse model of 
      Huntington's disease that determine disease presentation and age of onset. The 
      resulting model correlated variation across 3,086 behavioral traits with seven 
      different CAG-repeat lengths in the huntingtin gene (Htt). We selected behavioral 
      signatures for age and CAG-repeat length that most robustly distinguished between 
      mouse lines and validated the model by correctly predicting the repeat length of 
      a blinded mouse line. Sufficient discriminatory power to accurately predict 
      genotype required combined analysis of >200 phenotypic features. Our results 
      suggest that autosomal dominant disease-causing mutations could be predicted 
      through the use of subtle behavioral signatures that emerge in large-scale, 
      combinatorial analyses. Our work provides an open data platform that we now share 
      with the research community to aid efforts focused on understanding the pathways 
      that link behavioral consequences to genetic variation in Huntington's disease.

TI  - Environmental factors, life events, and trauma in the course of bipolar disorder.
PG  - 6-17
LID - 10.1111/pcn.12433 [doi]
AB  - The etiology and clinical course of bipolar disorder are considered to be 
      determined by genetic and environmental factors. Although the kindling hypothesis 
      emphasizes the impact of environmental factors on initial onset, their connection 
      to the outcome and clinical course have been poorly established. Hence, there 
      have been numerous research efforts to investigate the impact of environmental 
      factors on the clinical course of illness. Our aim is to outline recent research 
      on the impact of environmental determinants on the clinical course of bipolar 
      disorder. We carried out a computer-aided search to find publications on an 
      association between environmental factors, life events, and the clinical course 
      of bipolar disorder. Publications in the reference lists of suitable papers have 
      also been taken into consideration. We performed a narrative overview on all 
      eligible publications. The available body of data supports an association between 
      environmental factors and the clinical course of bipolar disorder. These factors 
      comprise prenatal, early-life, and entire lifespan aspects. Given varying sample 
      sizes and several methodological limitations, the reported quality and extent of 
      the association between environmental factors and the clinical course of bipolar 
      disorder should be interpreted with utmost caution. Systematic longitudinal 
      long-term follow-up trials are needed to obtain a clearer and more robust 
      picture.

AB  - During times of rapid environmental change, survival of most vertebrate 
      populations depends on their phenomic plasticity. Although differential 
      gene-expression and post-transcriptional processes of the host genome receive 
      focus as the main molecular mechanisms, growing evidence points to the gut 
      microbiota as a key driver defining hosts' phenotypes. We propose that the 
      plasticity of the gut microbiota might be an essential factor determining 
      phenomic plasticity of vertebrates, and that it might play a pivotal role when 
      vertebrates acclimate and adapt to fast environmental variation. We contemplate 
      some key questions and suggest methodological approaches and experimental designs 
      that can be used to evaluate whether gut microorganisms provide a boost of 
      plasticity to vertebrates' phenomes, thereby increasing their acclimation and 
      adaptation capacity.

AB  - High-throughput phenotyping produces multiple measurements over time, which 
      require new methods of analyses that are flexible in their quantification of 
      plant growth and transpiration, yet are computationally economic. Here we develop 
      such analyses and apply this to a rice population genotyped with a 700k SNP 
      high-density array. Two rice diversity panels, indica and aus, containing a total 
      of 553 genotypes, are phenotyped in waterlogged conditions. Using cubic smoothing 
      splines to estimate plant growth and transpiration, we identify four time 
      intervals that characterize the early responses of rice to salinity. Relative 
      growth rate, transpiration rate and transpiration use efficiency (TUE) are 
      analysed using a new association model that takes into account the interaction 
      between treatment (control and salt) and genetic marker. This model allows the 
      identification of previously undetected loci affecting TUE on chromosome 11, 
      providing insights into the early responses of rice to salinity, in particular 
      into the effects of salinity on plant growth and transpiration.

PG  - 788-803
AB  - Phenomics is a field of science at the junction of biology and informatics which 
      solves the problems of rapid, accurate estimation of the plant phenotype; it was 
      rapidly developed because of the need to analyze phenotypic characteristics in 
      large scale genetic and breeding experiments in plants. It is based on using the 
      methods of computer image analysis and integration of biological data. Owing to 
      automation, new approaches make it possible to considerably accelerate the 
      process of estimating the characteristics of a phenotype, to increase its 
      accuracy, and to remove a subjectivism (inherent to humans). The main 
      technologies of high-throughput plant phenotyping in both controlled and field 
      conditions, their advantages and disadvantages, and also the prospects of their 
      use for the efficient solution of problems of plant genetics and breeding are 
      presented in the review.

TI  - Moderate to severe water limitation differentially affects the phenome and ionome 
      of Arabidopsis.
PG  - 94-106
LID - 10.1071/FP16172 [doi]
AB  - Food security is currently one of the major challenges that we are facing as a 
      species. Understanding plant responses and adaptations to limited water 
      availability is key to maintain or improve crop yield, and this is even more 
      critical considering the different projections of climate change. In this work, 
      we combined two high-throughput -'omic' platforms ('phenomics' and 'ionomics') to 
      begin dissecting time-dependent effects of water limitation in Arabidopsis leaves 
      and ultimately seed yield. As proof of concept, we acquired high-resolution 
      images with visible, fluorescence, and near infrared cameras and used commercial 
      and open source algorithms to extract the information contained in those images. 
      At a defined point, samples were also taken for elemental profiling. Our results 
      show that growth, biomass and photosynthetic efficiency were affected mostly 
      under severe water limitation regimes and these differences were exacerbated at 
      later developmental stages. The elemental composition and seed yield, however, 
      changed across the different water regimes tested and these changes included 
      under- and over- accumulation of elements compared with well-watered plants. Our 
      results demonstrate that the combination of phenotyping techniques can be 
      successfully used to identify specific bottlenecks during plant development that 
      could compromise biomass, yield, and the nutritional quality of plants.
