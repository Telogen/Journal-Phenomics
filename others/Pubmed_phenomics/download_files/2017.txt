TI  - Salmonella typhimurium Infection Reduces Schistosoma japonicum Worm Burden in

AB  - Coinfection of microorganisms is a common phenomenon in humans and animals. In 
      order to further our understanding of the progress of coinfection and the 
      possible interaction between different pathogens, we have built a coinfection 
      mouse model with Schistosoma japonicum and Salmonella typhimurium, and used this 
      model to investigate the systemic metabolic and immune responses using NMR-based 
      metabonomics and immunological techniques. Our results show that Salmonella 
      typhimurium (ATCC14028) infection reduces the number of adult schistosomal worms 
      and eggs, relieves symptoms of schistosomiasis and also abates the mortality of 
      mice infected by Schistosoma japonicum. In addition, Salmonella typhimurium 
      infection counteracts the metabolic disturbances associated with schistosomiasis, 
      which was reflected by the reverted levels of metabolites in coinfected mice, 
      compared with the Schistosoma japonicum infected mice. Furthermore, immune 
      analyses also indicate that shift of the immune response to different pathogens 
      is a result of indirect interactions between Schistosoma japonicum and Salmonella 
      typhimurium within the host. Salmonella typhimurium infection can ameliorate 
      Schistosoma japonicum-caused schistosomiasis in BALB/c mice, which is most likely 
      due to inverse immune polarization. Our work provides an insight into coinfection 
      between Schistosoma japonicum and Salmonella typhimurium, and may further 
      contribute to the development of new tools for controlling Schistosoma 
      japonicum-associated diseases.

TI  - Leaf-GP: an open and automated software application for measuring growth 
      phenotypes for arabidopsis and wheat.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plants demonstrate dynamic growth phenotypes that are determined by 
      genetic and environmental factors. Phenotypic analysis of growth features over 
      time is a key approach to understand how plants interact with environmental 
      change as well as respond to different treatments. Although the importance of 
      measuring dynamic growth traits is widely recognised, available open software 
      tools are limited in terms of batch image processing, multiple traits analyses, 
      software usability and cross-referencing results between experiments, making 
      automated phenotypic analysis problematic. RESULTS: Here, we present Leaf-GP 
      (Growth Phenotypes), an easy-to-use and open software application that can be 
      executed on different computing platforms. To facilitate diverse scientific 
      communities, we provide three software versions, including a graphic user 
      interface (GUI) for personal computer (PC) users, a command-line interface for 
      high-performance computer (HPC) users, and a well-commented interactive Jupyter 
      Notebook (also known as the iPython Notebook) for computational biologists and 
      computer scientists. The software is capable of extracting multiple growth traits 
      automatically from large image datasets. We have utilised it in Arabidopsis 
      thaliana and wheat (Triticum aestivum) growth studies at the Norwich Research 
      Park (NRP, UK). By quantifying a number of growth phenotypes over time, we have 
      identified diverse plant growth patterns between different genotypes under 
      several experimental conditions. As Leaf-GP has been evaluated with noisy image 
      series acquired by different imaging devices (e.g. smartphones and digital 
      cameras) and still produced reliable biological outputs, we therefore believe 
      that our automated analysis workflow and customised computer vision based feature 
      extraction software implementation can facilitate a broader plant research 
      community for their growth and development studies. Furthermore, because we 
      implemented Leaf-GP based on open Python-based computer vision, image analysis 
      and machine learning libraries, we believe that our software not only can 
      contribute to biological research, but also demonstrates how to utilise existing 
      open numeric and scientific libraries (e.g. Scikit-image, OpenCV, SciPy and 
      Scikit-learn) to build sound plant phenomics analytic solutions, in a efficient 
      and effective way. CONCLUSIONS: Leaf-GP is a sophisticated software application 
      that provides three approaches to quantify growth phenotypes from large image 
      series. We demonstrate its usefulness and high accuracy based on two biological 
      applications: (1) the quantification of growth traits for Arabidopsis genotypes 
      under two temperature conditions; and (2) measuring wheat growth in the 
      glasshouse over time. The software is easy-to-use and cross-platform, which can 
      be executed on Mac OS, Windows and HPC, with open Python-based scientific 
      libraries preinstalled. Our work presents the advancement of how to integrate 
      computer vision, image analysis, machine learning and software engineering in 
      plant phenomics software implementation. To serve the plant research community, 
      our modulated source code, detailed comments, executables (.exe for Windows; .app 
      for Mac), and experimental results are freely available at 
      https://github.com/Crop-Phenomics-Group/Leaf-GP/releases.

TI  - A machine learning-based framework to identify type 2 diabetes through electronic 
      health records.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discover diverse genotype-phenotype associations affiliated with 
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) via genome-wide association study (GWAS) and 
      phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), more cases (T2DM subjects) and controls 
      (subjects without T2DM) are required to be identified (e.g., via Electronic 
      Health Records (EHR)). However, existing expert based identification algorithms 
      often suffer in a low recall rate and could miss a large number of valuable 
      samples under conservative filtering standards. The goal of this work is to 
      develop a semi-automated framework based on machine learning as a pilot study to 
      liberalize filtering criteria to improve recall rate with a keeping of low false 
      positive rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose a data informed framework for 
      identifying subjects with and without T2DM from EHR via feature engineering and 
      machine learning. We evaluate and contrast the identification performance of 
      widely-used machine learning models within our framework, including 
      k-Nearest-Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector 
      Machine and Logistic Regression. Our framework was conducted on 300 patient 
      samples (161 cases, 60 controls and 79 unconfirmed subjects), randomly selected 
      from 23,281 diabetes related cohort retrieved from a regional distributed EHR 
      repository ranging from 2012 to 2014. RESULTS: We apply top-performing machine 
      learning algorithms on the engineered features. We benchmark and contrast the 
      accuracy, precision, AUC, sensitivity and specificity of classification models 
      against the state-of-the-art expert algorithm for identification of T2DM 
      subjects. Our results indicate that the framework achieved high identification 
      performances (∼0.98 in average AUC), which are much higher than the 
      state-of-the-art algorithm (0.71 in AUC). DISCUSSION: Expert algorithm-based 
      identification of T2DM subjects from EHR is often hampered by the high missing 
      rates due to their conservative selection criteria. Our framework leverages 
      machine learning and feature engineering to loosen such selection criteria to 
      achieve a high identification rate of cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      proposed framework demonstrates a more accurate and efficient approach for 
      identifying subjects with and without T2DM from EHR.

TI  - Recent Developments in Mendelian Randomization Studies.
PG  - 330-345
LID - 10.1007/s40471-017-0128-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mendelian randomization (MR) is a strategy for evaluating 
      causality in observational epidemiological studies. MR exploits the fact that 
      genotypes are not generally susceptible to reverse causation and confounding, due 
      to their fixed nature and Mendel's First and Second Laws of Inheritance. MR has 
      the potential to provide information on causality in many situations where 
      randomized controlled trials are not possible, but the results of MR studies must 
      be interpreted carefully to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      In this review, we outline the principles behind MR, as well as assumptions and 
      limitations of the method. Extensions to the basic approach are discussed, 
      including two-sample MR, bidirectional MR, two-step MR, multivariable MR, and 
      factorial MR. We also consider some new applications and recent developments in 
      the methodology, including its ability to inform drug development, automation of 
      the method using tools such as MR-Base, and phenome-wide and hypothesis-free MR. 
      SUMMARY: In conjunction with the growing availability of large-scale genomic 
      databases, higher level of automation and increased robustness of the methods, MR 
      promises to be a valuable strategy to examine causality in complex 
      biological/omics networks, inform drug development and prioritize intervention 
      targets for disease prevention in the future.

AB  - Genome mutually interacts with internal and external environmental factors to 
      result in different phenome that contains two important elements of proteins and 
      metabolites, which link genome to predictive, preventive and personalized 
      medicine (PPPM) or precision medicine (PM). Proteomic variations are the final 
      presentation of the genomic and transcriptomic variations, and are involved in a 
      wide range of variations including copy number of protein, splicing, 
      post-translational modifications, translocation/re-distribution, spatial 
      conformation, and pathway-network systems. Metabolomic variations are the 
      comprehensive results originated from all types of in vivo substances, and are 
      involved in a wide range of alterations of metabolites generated from sugars, 
      lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, and metabolic network systems. Currently the 
      studies on variations in proteome and in metabolome are much insufficient in the 
      width and depth in the fields of proteomics and metabolomics. The development of 
      high-throughput, high-sensitivity, and especially high-reproducibility approaches 
      is necessary to maximize the coverage of variations in proteome and in 
      metabolome. The studies of proteomic and metabolomic variations directly result 
      in the discovery of effective biomarkers to clarify molecular mechanisms of a 
      disease, determine reliable therapeutic targets, and benefit precise prediction, 
      diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. It has more important scientific values in 
      PPPM or PM. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE.

TI  - High-Throughput Phenotyping and QTL Mapping Reveals the Genetic Architecture of 
      Maize Plant Growth.
PG  - 1554-1564
LID - 10.1104/pp.16.01516 [doi]
AB  - With increasing demand for novel traits in crop breeding, the plant research 
      community faces the challenge of quantitatively analyzing the structure and 
      function of large numbers of plants. A clear goal of high-throughput phenotyping 
      is to bridge the gap between genomics and phenomics. In this study, we quantified 
      106 traits from a maize (Zea mays) recombinant inbred line population (n = 167) 
      across 16 developmental stages using the automatic phenotyping platform. 
      Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping with a high-density genetic linkage map, 
      including 2,496 recombinant bins, was used to uncover the genetic basis of these 
      complex agronomic traits, and 988 QTLs have been identified for all investigated 
      traits, including three QTL hotspots. Biomass accumulation and final yield were 
      predicted using a combination of dissected traits in the early growth stage. 
      These results reveal the dynamic genetic architecture of maize plant growth and 
      enhance ideotype-based maize breeding and prediction.

AB  - The colon ascendens stent peritonitis (CASP) surgery induces a leakage of gut 
      contents, causing polymicrobial sepsis related to post-operative multiple organ 
      failure and death in surgical patient. To evaluate the effects of CASP on 
      multiple organs, we analyzed the systemic metabolic consequences in liver, 
      kidney, lung, and heart of rats after CASP by employing a combination of 
      metabolomics, clinical chemistry, and biological assays. We found that CASP 
      surgery after 18 h resulted in striking elevations of lipid, amino acids, 
      acetate, choline, PC, and GPC in rat liver together with significant depletion of 
      glucose and glycogen. Marked elevations of organic acids including lactate, 
      acetate, and creatine and amino acids accompanied by decline of glucose, betaine, 
      TMAO, choline metabolites (PC and GPC) nucleotides, and a range of organic 
      osmolytes such as myo-inositol are observed in the kidney of 18 h post-operative 
      rat. Furthermore, 18 h post-operative rats exhibited accumulations of lipid, 
      amino acids, and depletions of taurine, myo-inositol, choline, PC, and GPC and 
      some nucleotides including uridine, inosine, and adenosine in the lung. In 
      addition, significant elevations of some amino acids, uracil, betaine, and 
      choline metabolites, together with depletion of inosine-5'-monophosphate, were 
      only observed in the heart of 18 h post-operative rats. These results provide new 
      insights into pathological consequences of CASP surgery, which are important for 
      timely prognosis of sepsis.

TI  - Systematically linking tranSMART, Galaxy and EGA for reusing human translational 
      research data.
LID - ELIXIR-1488 [pii]
LID - 10.12688/f1000research.12168.1 [doi]
AB  - The availability of high-throughput molecular profiling techniques has provided 
      more accurate and informative data for regular clinical studies. Nevertheless, 
      complex computational workflows are required to interpret these data. Over the 
      past years, the data volume has been growing explosively, requiring robust human 
      data management to organise and integrate the data efficiently. For this reason, 
      we set up an ELIXIR implementation study, together with the Translational 
      research IT (TraIT) programme, to design a data ecosystem that is able to link 
      raw and interpreted data. In this project, the data from the TraIT Cell Line Use 
      Case (TraIT-CLUC) are used as a test case for this system. Within this ecosystem, 
      we use the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) to store raw molecular profiling 
      data; tranSMART to collect interpreted molecular profiling data and clinical data 
      for corresponding samples; and Galaxy to store, run and manage the computational 
      workflows. We can integrate these data by linking their repositories 
      systematically. To showcase our design, we have structured the TraIT-CLUC data, 
      which contain a variety of molecular profiling data types, for storage in both 
      tranSMART and EGA. The metadata provided allows referencing between tranSMART and 
      EGA, fulfilling the cycle of data submission and discovery; we have also designed 
      a data flow from EGA to Galaxy, enabling reanalysis of the raw data in Galaxy. In 
      this way, users can select patient cohorts in tranSMART, trace them back to the 
      raw data and perform (re)analysis in Galaxy. Our conclusion is that the majority 
      of metadata does not necessarily need to be stored (redundantly) in both 
      databases, but that instead FAIR persistent identifiers should be available for 
      well-defined data ontology levels: study, data access committee, physical sample, 
      data sample and raw data file. This approach will pave the way for the stable 
      linkage and reuse of data.

TI  - Genome-wide Regional Heritability Mapping Identifies a Locus Within the TOX2 Gene 
      Associated With Major Depressive Disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the second largest cause of global 
      disease burden. It has an estimated heritability of 37%, but published 
      genome-wide association studies have so far identified few risk loci. 
      Haplotype-block-based regional heritability mapping (HRHM) estimates the 
      localized genetic variance explained by common variants within haplotype blocks, 
      integrating the effects of multiple variants, and may be more powerful for 
      identifying MDD-associated genomic regions. METHODS: We applied HRHM to 
      Generation Scotland: The Scottish Family Health Study, a large family- and 
      population-based Scottish cohort (N = 19,896). Single-single nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) and haplotype-based association tests were used to localize 
      the association signal within the regions identified by HRHM. Functional 
      prediction was used to investigate the effect of MDD-associated SNPs within the 
      regions. RESULTS: A haplotype block across a 24-kb region within the TOX2 gene 
      reached genome-wide significance in HRHM. Single-SNP- and haplotype-based 
      association tests demonstrated that five of nine genotyped SNPs and two 
      haplotypes within this block were significantly associated with MDD. The 
      expression of TOX2 and a brain-specific long noncoding RNA RP1-269M15.3 in 
      frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens basal ganglia, respectively, were 
      significantly regulated by MDD-associated SNPs within this region. Both the 
      regional heritability and single-SNP associations within this block were 
      replicated in the UK-Ireland group of the most recent release of the Psychiatric 
      Genomics Consortium (PGC), the PGC2-MDD (Major Depression Dataset). The SNP 
      association was also replicated in a depressive symptom sample that shares some 
      individuals with the PGC2-MDD. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the value of 
      HRHM for MDD and provides an important target within TOX2 for further functional 
      studies.

TI  - Models of microbiome evolution incorporating host and microbial selection.
PG  - 127
LID - 10.1186/s40168-017-0343-x [doi]
LID - 127
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous empirical studies suggest that hosts and microbes exert 
      reciprocal selective effects on their ecological partners. Nonetheless, we still 
      lack an explicit framework to model the dynamics of both hosts and microbes under 
      selection. In a previous study, we developed an agent-based forward-time 
      computational framework to simulate the neutral evolution of host-associated 
      microbial communities in a constant-sized, unstructured population of hosts. 
      These neutral models allowed offspring to sample microbes randomly from parents 
      and/or from the environment. Additionally, the environmental pool of available 
      microbes was constituted by fixed and persistent microbial OTUs and by 
      contributions from host individuals in the preceding generation. METHODS: In this 
      paper, we extend our neutral models to allow selection to operate on both hosts 
      and microbes. We do this by constructing a phenome for each microbial OTU 
      consisting of a sample of traits that influence host and microbial fitnesses 
      independently. Microbial traits can influence the fitness of hosts ("host 
      selection") and the fitness of microbes ("trait-mediated microbial selection"). 
      Additionally, the fitness effects of traits on microbes can be modified by their 
      hosts ("host-mediated microbial selection"). We simulate the effects of these 
      three types of selection, individually or in combination, on microbiome 
      diversities and the fitnesses of hosts and microbes over several thousand 
      generations of hosts. RESULTS: We show that microbiome diversity is strongly 
      influenced by selection acting on microbes. Selection acting on hosts only 
      influences microbiome diversity when there is near-complete direct or indirect 
      parental contribution to the microbiomes of offspring. Unsurprisingly, microbial 
      fitness increases under microbial selection. Interestingly, when host selection 
      operates, host fitness only increases under two conditions: (1) when there is a 
      strong parental contribution to microbial communities or (2) in the absence of a 
      strong parental contribution, when host-mediated selection acts on microbes 
      concomitantly. CONCLUSIONS: We present a computational framework that integrates 
      different selective processes acting on the evolution of microbiomes. Our 
      framework demonstrates that selection acting on microbes can have a strong effect 
      on microbial diversities and fitnesses, whereas selection on hosts can have 
      weaker outcomes.

TI  - Association of ZFHX3 gene variation with atrial fibrillation, cerebral 
      infarction, and lung thromboembolism: An autopsy study.

AB  - AIM: We aimed to study a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2106261, in the 
      transcription factor gene, ZFHX3, in atrial fibrillation (AF) and other related 
      phenotypes by phenome scanning in a Japanese population. METHOD: We retrieved 
      consecutive autopsy data (n=2433, mean age=80 years) from the Japanese SNP 
      database for geriatric diseases (JG-SNP). Clinical data, including an AF 
      diagnosis, were collected from medical charts. Genotyping was performed with the 
      DNA chip method. We also analyzed 42 pathological and 26 clinical phenotypes, 
      including cerebral infarctions (CIs) and lung thromboembolisms (LTs), diagnosed 
      by macroscopic inspection during the autopsy. RESULT: Among the 2433 patients 
      with available data, 18.6% had AF, 29.4% had CI, and 4.9% had LT phenotypes. The 
      A allele of the rs2106261 SNP was significantly associated with AF, after 
      adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking (AA+AG/GG, OR=1.51, 
      95%CI: 1.16-1.97, p=0.002). In the entire cohort, CI was not associated with 
      rs2106261 (p=0.14). However, among patients under 80 years old, rs2106261 was 
      significantly associated with CI (AA+AG/GG, OR=1.57, 95%CI: 1.09-2.26, p=0.01). 
      LT was also associated with rs2106261 (AA+AG/GG, OR=1.99, 95%CI: 1.31-3.01, 
      p=0.001). Associations between rs2106261 and CI and LT remained positive after 
      adjusting for the presence of AF, which indicated that this SNP variant might 
      serve as an independent risk marker. CONCLUSION: We showed that the ZFHX3 
      polymorphism, rs2106261 (A allele), was a risk marker for AF and AF-related 
      phenotypes. The roles of this variant in the development of AF and its related 
      phenotypes warrant further investigation.

TI  - Combination of Metabolomic and Proteomic Analysis Revealed Different Features 
      among Lactobacillus delbrueckii Subspecies bulgaricus and lactis Strains While In 
      Vivo Testing in the Model Organism Caenorhabditis elegans Highlighted Probiotic 
      Properties.

AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii represents a technologically relevant member of lactic 
      acid bacteria, since the two subspecies bulgaricus and lactis are widely 
      associated with fermented dairy products. In the present work, we report the 
      characterization of two commercial strains belonging to L. delbrueckii subspecies 
      bulgaricus, lactis and a novel strain previously isolated from a traditional 
      fermented fresh cheese. A phenomic approach was performed by combining 
      metabolomic and proteomic analysis of the three strains, which were subsequently 
      supplemented as food source to the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, with 
      the final aim to evaluate their possible probiotic effects. Restriction analysis 
      of 16S ribosomal DNA revealed that the novel foodborne strain belonged to L. 
      delbrueckii subspecies lactis. Proteomic and metabolomic approaches showed 
      differences in folate, aminoacid and sugar metabolic pathways among the three 
      strains. Moreover, evaluation of C. elegans lifespan, larval development, brood 
      size, and bacterial colonization capacity demonstrated that L. delbrueckii subsp. 
      bulgaricus diet exerted beneficial effects on nematodes. On the other hand, both 
      L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strains affected lifespan and larval development. We 
      have characterized three strains belonging to L. delbrueckii subspecies 
      bulgaricus and lactis highlighting their divergent origin. In particular, the two 
      closely related isolates L. delbrueckii subspecies lactis display different 
      galactose metabolic capabilities. Moreover, the L. delbrueckii subspecies 
      bulgaricus strain demonstrated potential probiotic features. Combination of omic 
      platforms coupled with in vivo screening in the simple model organism C. elegans 
      is a powerful tool to characterize industrially relevant bacterial isolates.

AB  - In silico network-based methods have shown promising results in the field of drug 
      development. Yet, most of networks used in the previous research have not 
      included context information even though biological associations actually do 
      appear in the specific contexts. Here, we reconstruct an anatomical 
      context-specific network by assigning contexts to biological associations using 
      protein expression data and scientific literature. Furthermore, we employ the 
      context-specific network for the analysis of drug effects with a proximity 
      measure between drug targets and diseases. Distinct from previous 
      context-specific networks, intercellular associations and phenomic level entities 
      such as biological processes are included in our network to represent the human 
      body. It is observed that performances in inferring drug-disease associations are 
      increased by adding context information and phenomic level entities. In 
      particular, hypertension, a disease related to multiple organs and associated 
      with several phenomic level entities, is analyzed in detail to investigate how 
      our network facilitates the inference of drug-disease associations. Our results 
      indicate that the inclusion of context information, intercellular associations, 
      and phenomic level entities can contribute towards a better prediction of 
      drug-disease associations and provide detailed insight into understanding of how 
      drugs affect diseases in the human body.

AB  - Polarized vesicle transport plays an important role in cell polarization, but the 
      mechanisms underlying this process and its role in innate immune responses are 
      not well understood. Here, we describe a phosphorylation-regulated polarization 
      mechanism that is important for neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells during 
      inflammatory responses. We show that the protein kinase PKN1 phosphorylates 
      RPH3A, which enhances binding of RPH3A to guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound 
      RAB21. These interactions are important for polarized localization of RAB21 and 
      RPH3A in neutrophils, which leads to PIP5K1C90 polarization. Consistent with the 
      roles of PIP5K1C90 polarization, the lack of PKN1 or RPH3A impairs neutrophil 
      integrin activation, adhesion to endothelial cells, and infiltration in 
      inflammatory models. Furthermore, myeloid-specific loss of PKN1 decreases tissue 
      injury in a renal ischemia-reperfusion model. Thus, this study characterizes a 
      mechanism for protein polarization in neutrophils and identifies a potential 
      protein kinase target for therapeutic intervention in reperfusion-related tissue 
      injury.

TI  - The Lung is a Host Defense Niche for Immediate Neutrophil-Mediated Vascular 
      Protection.

LID - 10.1126/sciimmunol.aam8929 [doi]
AB  - Bloodstream infection is a hallmark of sepsis, a medically emergent condition 
      requiring rapid treatment. However, upregulation of host defense proteins through 
      toll-like receptors and NFκB requires hours after endotoxin detection. Using 
      confocal pulmonary intravital microscopy, we identified that the lung provides a 
      TLR4-Myd88-and abl tyrosine kinase-dependent niche for immediate CD11b-dependent 
      neutrophil responses to endotoxin and Gram-negative bloodstream pathogens. In an 
      in vivo model of bacteremia, neutrophils crawled to and rapidly phagocytosed 
      Escherichia coli sequestered to the lung endothelium. Therefore, the lung 
      capillaries provide a vascular defensive niche whereby endothelium and 
      neutrophils cooperate for immediate detection and capture of disseminating 
      pathogens.

TI  - Predictive value of 1H MR spectroscopy and 18F-FDG PET/CT for local control of 
      advanced oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma receiving 
      chemoradiotherapy: a prospective study.
PG  - 115513-115525
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.23306 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether pretreatment in vivo 1H magnetic resonance (MR) 
      spectroscopy at 3 Tesla (T) and 18F-FDG PET/CT can offer predictive power 
      regarding the local control of oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal squamous cell 
      carcinoma (OHSCC) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: (1)H MR spectroscopy was 
      performed in addition to conventional MR imaging before definitive 
      chemoradiotherapy in 58 patients with advanced OHSCC. The relationship of local 
      control with the (1)H MR spectroscopy and (18)F-FDG PET/CT parameters was 
      analyzed. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 17.6 months, 13 (22.4%) patients 
      exhibited local failure; whereas the remaining 45 achieved local control. 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis identified age > 60 years, creatine level on MRS ≦ 6.02 mM, 
      glutamine and glutamate (Glx) level on MRS > 3.31 mM, and total lesion glycolysis 
      (TLG) on (18)F-FDG PET/CT > 217.18 g/mL × mL as significant adverse predictors 
      for 2-year local control. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age 
      (p=0.017), Glx level on MRS (p=0.021), and TLG on (18)F-FDG PET/CT (p=0.028) 
      retained their independent prognostic significance. A scoring system was 
      constructed based on the sum of these three factors. We found that patients with 
      scores of 2-3 had significantly poorer local control rates than patients with 
      scores of 0-1 (33.3% versus 86.8%, p=0.003). CONCLUSION: We conclude that Glx on 
      (1)H MR spectroscopy at 3 T was the independent prognostic factor for local 
      control of OHSCC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy, and its combination 
      with age and TLG may help identify a subgroup of patients at high risk for 
      developing local failure.

TI  - PhenoCurve: capturing dynamic phenotype-environment relationships using phenomics 
      data.
PG  - 1370-1378
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btw673 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Phenomics is essential for understanding the mechanisms that regulate 
      or influence growth, fitness, and development. Techniques have been developed to 
      conduct high-throughput large-scale phenotyping on animals, plants and humans, 
      aiming to bridge the gap between genomics, gene functions and traits. Although 
      new developments in phenotyping techniques are exciting, we are limited by the 
      tools to analyze fully the massive phenotype data, especially the dynamic 
      relationships between phenotypes and environments. RESULTS: We present a new 
      algorithm called PhenoCurve, a knowledge-based curve fitting algorithm, aiming to 
      identify the complex relationships between phenotypes and environments, thus 
      studying both values and trends of phenomics data. The results on both real and 
      simulated data showed that PhenoCurve has the best performance among all the six 
      tested methods. Its application to photosynthesis hysteresis pattern 
      identification reveals new functions of core genes that control photosynthetic 
      efficiency in response to varying environmental conditions, which are critical 
      for understanding plant energy storage and improving crop productivity.

      phenomics.uky.edu/PhenoCurve. CONTACT: chen.jin@uky.edu or kramerd8@cns.msu.edu.

TI  - MicroRNA-29a Alleviates Bile Duct Ligation Exacerbation of Hepatic Fibrosis in 
      Mice through Epigenetic Control of Methyltransferases.
LID - 10.3390/ijms18010192 [doi]
LID - 192
AB  - MicroRNA-29 (miR-29) is found to modulate hepatic stellate cells' (HSCs) 
      activation and, thereby, reduces liver fibrosis pathogenesis. Histone 
      methyltransferase regulation of epigenetic reactions reportedly participates in 
      hepatic fibrosis. This study is undertaken to investigate the miR-29a regulation 
      of the methyltransferase signaling and epigenetic program in hepatic fibrosis 
      progression. miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates 
      were subjected to bile duct-ligation (BDL) to develop cholestatic liver fibrosis. 
      Primary HSCs were transfected with a miR-29a mimic and antisense inhibitor. 
      Profibrogenic gene expression, histone methyltransferases and global genetic 
      methylation were probed with real-time quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemical 
      stain, Western blot and ELISA. Hepatic tissue in miR-29aTg mice displayed weak 
      fibrotic matrix as evidenced by Sirius Red staining concomitant with low fibrotic 
      matrix collagen 1α1 expression within affected tissues compared to the wild-type 
      mice. miR-29a overexpression reduced the BDL exaggeration of methyltransferases, 
      DNMT1, DNMT3b and SET domain containing 1A (SET1A) expression. It also elevated 
      phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) signaling within 
      liver tissue. In vitro, miR-29a mimic transfection lowered collagen 1α1, DNMT1, 
      DNMT3b and SET1A expression in HSCs. Gain of miR-29a signaling resulted in DNA 
      hypomethylation and high PTEN expression. This study shines a new light on 
      miR-29a inhibition of methyltransferase, a protective effect to maintain the DNA 
      hypomethylation state that decreases fibrogenic activities in HSC. These robust 
      analyses also highlight the miR-29a regulation of epigenetic actions to 
      ameliorate excessive fibrosis during cholestatic liver fibrosis development.

AB  - Phenotyping plays an important role in crop science research; the accurate and 
      rapid acquisition of phenotypic information of plants or cells in different 
      environments is helpful for exploring the inheritance and expression patterns of 
      the genome to determine the association of genomic and phenotypic information to 
      increase the crop yield. Traditional methods for acquiring crop traits, such as 
      plant height, leaf color, leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll content, biomass and 
      yield, rely on manual sampling, which is time-consuming and laborious. Unmanned 
      aerial vehicle remote sensing platforms (UAV-RSPs) equipped with different 
      sensors have recently become an important approach for fast and non-destructive 
      high throughput phenotyping and have the advantage of flexible and convenient 
      operation, on-demand access to data and high spatial resolution. UAV-RSPs are a 
      powerful tool for studying phenomics and genomics. As the methods and 
      applications for field phenotyping using UAVs to users who willing to derive 
      phenotypic parameters from large fields and tests with the minimum effort on 
      field work and getting highly reliable results are necessary, the current status 
      and perspectives on the topic of UAV-RSPs for field-based phenotyping were 
      reviewed based on the literature survey of crop phenotyping using UAV-RSPs in the 
      Web of Science™ Core Collection database and cases study by NERCITA. The 
      reference for the selection of UAV platforms and remote sensing sensors, the 
      commonly adopted methods and typical applications for analyzing phenotypic traits 
      by UAV-RSPs, and the challenge for crop phenotyping by UAV-RSPs were considered. 
      The review can provide theoretical and technical support to promote the 
      applications of UAV-RSPs for crop phenotyping.

TI  - miRNA-miRNA crosstalk: from genomics to phenomics.
PG  - 1002-1011
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbw073 [doi]
AB  - The discovery of microRNA (miRNA)-miRNA crosstalk has greatly improved our 
      understanding of complex gene regulatory networks in normal and disease-specific 
      physiological conditions. Numerous approaches have been proposed for modeling 
      miRNA-miRNA networks based on genomic sequences, miRNA-mRNA regulation, 
      functional information and phenomics alone, or by integrating heterogeneous data. 
      In addition, it is expected that miRNA-miRNA crosstalk can be reprogrammed in 
      different tissues or specific diseases. Thus, transcriptome data have also been 
      integrated to construct context-specific miRNA-miRNA networks. In this review, we 
      summarize the state-of-the-art miRNA-miRNA network modeling methods, which range 
      from genomics to phenomics, where we focus on the need to integrate heterogeneous 
      types of omics data. Finally, we suggest future directions for studies of 
      crosstalk of noncoding RNAs. This comprehensive summarization and discussion 
      elucidated in this work provide constructive insights into miRNA-miRNA crosstalk.

TI  - Synchrotron microCT imaging of soft tissue in juvenile zebrafish reveals 
      retinotectal projections.

LID - 10.1117/12.2267477 [doi]
AB  - Biomedical research and clinical diagnosis would benefit greatly from full volume 
      determinations of anatomical phenotype. Comprehensive tools for morphological 
      phenotyping are central for the emerging field of phenomics, which requires 
      high-throughput, systematic, accurate, and reproducible data collection from 
      organisms affected by genetic, disease, or environmental variables. 
      Theoretically, complete anatomical phenotyping requires the assessment of every 
      cell type in the whole organism, but this ideal is presently untenable due to the 
      lack of an unbiased 3D imaging method that allows histopathological assessment of 
      any cell type despite optical opacity. Histopathology, the current clinical 
      standard for diagnostic phenotyping, involves the microscopic study of tissue 
      sections to assess qualitative aspects of tissue architecture, disease 
      mechanisms, and physiological state. However, quantitative features of tissue 
      architecture such as cellular composition and cell counting in tissue volumes can 
      only be approximated due to characteristics of tissue sectioning, including 
      incomplete sampling and the constraints of 2D imaging of 5 micron thick tissue 
      slabs. We have used a small, vertebrate organism, the zebrafish, to test the 
      potential of microCT for systematic macroscopic and microscopic morphological 
      phenotyping. While cell resolution is routinely achieved using methods such as 
      light sheet fluorescence microscopy and optical tomography, these methods do not 
      provide the pancellular perspective characteristic of histology, and are 
      constrained by the limited penetration of visible light through pigmented and 
      opaque specimens, as characterizes zebrafish juveniles. Here, we provide an 
      example of neuroanatomy that can be studied by microCT of stained soft tissue at 
      1.43 micron isotropic voxel resolution. We conclude that synchrotron microCT is a 
      form of 3D imaging that may potentially be adopted towards more reproducible, 
      large-scale, morphological phenotyping of optically opaque tissues. Further 
      development of soft tissue microCT, visualization and quantitative tools will 
      enhance its utility.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BPD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are primary major mood 
      disorders. Recent studies suggest that they share certain psychopathological 
      features and common risk genes, but unraveling the full genetic architecture 
      underlying the risk of major mood disorders remains an important scientific task. 
      The public genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets offer the opportunity 
      to examine this topic by utilizing large amounts of combined genetic data, which 
      should ultimately allow a better understanding of the onset and development of 
      these illnesses. Genome-wide meta-analysis was performed by combining two GWAS 
      data sets on BPD and MDD (19,637 cases and 18,083 controls), followed by 
      replication analyses for the loci of interest in independent 12,364 cases and 
      76,633 controls from additional samples that were not included in the two GWAS 
      data sets. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10791889 at 11q13.2 was 
      significant in both discovery and replication samples. When combining all 
      samples, this SNP and multiple other SNPs at 2q11.2 (rs717454), 8q21.3 
      (rs10103191), and 11q13.2 (rs2167457) exhibited genome-wide significant 
      association with major mood disorders. The SNPs in 2q11.2 and 8q21.3 were novel 
      risk SNPs that were not previously reported, and SNPs at 11q13.2 were in high LD 
      with potential BPD risk SNPs implicated in a previous GWAS. The genome-wide 
      significant loci at 2q11.2 and 11q13.2 exhibited strong effects on the mRNA 
      expression of certain nearby genes in cerebellum. In conclusion, we have 
      identified several novel loci associated with major mood disorders, adding 
      further support for shared genetic risk between BPD and MDD. Our study highlights 
      the necessity and importance of mining public data sets to explore risk genes for 
      complex diseases such as mood disorders.

TI  - Genetic Architecture of Phenomic-Enabled Canopy Coverage in Glycine max.
PG  - 1081-1089
LID - 10.1534/genetics.116.198713 [doi]
AB  - Digital imagery can help to quantify seasonal changes in desirable crop 
      phenotypes that can be treated as quantitative traits. Because limitations in 
      precise and functional phenotyping restrain genetic improvement in the 
      postgenomic era, imagery-based phenomics could become the next breakthrough to 
      accelerate genetic gains in field crops. Whereas many phenomic studies focus on 
      exploratory analysis of spectral data without obvious interpretative value, we 
      used field images to directly measure soybean canopy development from 
      phenological stage V2 to R5. Over 3 years, we collected imagery using ground and 
      aerial platforms of a large and diverse nested association panel comprising 5555 
      lines. Genome-wide association analysis of canopy coverage across sampling dates 
      detected a large quantitative trait locus (QTL) on soybean (Glycine max, L. 
      Merr.) chromosome 19. This QTL provided an increase in yield of 47.3 kg ha(-1) 
      Variance component analysis indicated that a parameter, described as average 
      canopy coverage, is a highly heritable trait (h(2) = 0.77) with a promising 
      genetic correlation with grain yield (0.87), enabling indirect selection of yield 
      via canopy development parameters. Our findings indicate that fast canopy 
      coverage is an early season trait that is inexpensive to measure and has great 
      potential for application in breeding programs focused on yield improvement. We 
      recommend using the average canopy coverage in multiple trait schemes, especially 
      for the early stages of the breeding pipeline (including progeny rows and 
      preliminary yield trials), in which the large number of field plots makes 
      collection of grain yield data challenging.

TI  - Massively parallel sequencing and genome-wide copy number analysis revealed a 
      clonal relationship in benign metastasizing leiomyoma.
PG  - 47547-47554
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.17708 [doi]
AB  - Benign metastasizing leiomyoma (BML) is a rare disease entity typically 
      presenting as multiple extrauterine leiomyomas associated with a uterine 
      leiomyoma. It has been hypothesized that the extrauterine leiomyomata represent 
      distant metastasis of the uterine leiomyoma. To date, the only molecular evidence 
      supporting this hypothesis was derived from clonality analyses based on 
      X-chromosome inactivation assays. Here, we sought to address this issue by 
      examining paired specimens of synchronous pulmonary and uterine leiomyomata from 
      three patients using targeted massively parallel sequencing and molecular 
      inversion probe array analysis for detecting somatic mutations and copy number 
      aberrations. We detected identical non-hot-spot somatic mutations and similar 
      patterns of copy number aberrations (CNAs) in paired pulmonary and uterine 
      leiomyomata from two patients, indicating the clonal relationship between 
      pulmonary and uterine leiomyomata. In addition to loss of chromosome 22q found in 
      the literature, we identified additional recurrent CNAs including losses of 
      chromosome 3q and 11q. In conclusion, our findings of the clonal relationship 
      between synchronous pulmonary and uterine leiomyomas support the hypothesis that 
      BML represents a condition wherein a uterine leiomyoma disseminates to distant 
      extrauterine locations.

TI  - Flux balance analysis predicts Warburg-like effects of mouse hepatocyte deficient 
      in miR-122a.

LID - e1005618
AB  - The liver is a vital organ involving in various major metabolic functions in 
      human body. MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) plays an important role in the regulation of 
      liver metabolism, but its intrinsic physiological functions require further 
      clarification. This study integrated the genome-scale metabolic model of 
      hepatocytes and mouse experimental data with germline deletion of Mir122a 
      (Mir122a-/-) to infer Warburg-like effects. Elevated expression of MiR-122a 
      target genes in Mir122a-/-mice, especially those encoding for metabolic enzymes, 
      was applied to analyze the flux distributions of the genome-scale metabolic model 
      in normal and deficient states. By definition of the similarity ratio, we 
      compared the flux fold change of the genome-scale metabolic model computational 
      results and metabolomic profiling data measured through a liquid-chromatography 
      with mass spectrometer, respectively, for hepatocytes of 2-month-old mice in 
      normal and deficient states. The Ddc gene demonstrated the highest similarity 
      ratio of 95% to the biological hypothesis of the Warburg effect, and similarity 
      of 75% to the experimental observation. We also used 2, 6, and 11 months of 
      mir-122 knockout mice liver cell to examined the expression pattern of DDC in the 
      knockout mice livers to show upregulated profiles of DDC from the data. 
      Furthermore, through a bioinformatics (LINCS program) prediction, BTK inhibitors 
      and withaferin A could downregulate DDC expression, suggesting that such drugs 
      could potentially alter the early events of metabolomics of liver cancer cells.

AB  - Rice, Oryza sativa L., is one of the most important crops in the world. With the 
      rising world population, feeding people in a more sustainable and environmentally 
      friendly way becomes increasingly important. Therefore, the rice research 
      community needs to share resources to better understand the functions of rice 
      genes that are the foundation for future agricultural biotechnology development, 
      and one way to achieve this goal is via the extensive study of insertional 
      mutants. We have constructed a large rice insertional mutant population in a 
      japonica rice variety, Tainung 67. The collection contains about 93 000 mutant 
      lines, among them 85% with phenomics data and 65% with flanking sequence data. We 
      screened the phenotypes of 12 individual plants for each line grown under field 
      conditions according to 68 subcategories and 3 quantitative traits. Both 
      phenotypes and integration sites are searchable in the Taiwan Rice Insertional 
      Mutants Database. Detailed analyses of phenomics data, T-DNA flanking sequences, 
      and whole-genome sequencing data for rice insertional mutants can lead to the 
      discovery of novel genes. In addition, studies of mutant phenotypes can reveal 
      relationships among varieties, cultivation locations, and cropping seasons.

AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of conditions 
      that include steatohepatitis and fibrosis that are thought to emanate from 
      hepatic steatosis. Few robust biomarkers or diagnostic tests have been developed 
      for hepatic steatosis in the setting of obesity. We have developed a 
      multi-component classifier for hepatic steatosis comprised of phenotypic, 
      genomic, and proteomic variables using data from 576 adults with extreme obesity 
      who underwent bariatric surgery and intra-operative liver biopsy. Using a 443 
      patient training set, protein biomarker discovery was performed using the highly 
      multiplexed SOMAscan(®) proteomic assay, a set of 19 clinical variables, and the 
      steatosis predisposing PNPLA3 rs738409 single nucleotide polymorphism genotype 
      status. The most stable markers were selected using a stability selection 
      algorithm with a L(1)-regularized logistic regression kernel and were then fitted 
      with logistic regression models to classify steatosis, that were then tested 
      against a 133 sample blinded verification set. The highest area under the ROC 
      curve (AUC) for steatosis of PNPLA3 rs738409 genotype, 8 proteins, or 19 
      phenotypic variables was 0.913, whereas the final classifier that included 
      variables from all three domains had an AUC of 0.935. These data indicate that 
      multi-domain modeling has better predictive power than comprehensive analysis of 
      variables from a single domain.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of borderline personality disorder reveals genetic 
      overlap with bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia.
PG  - e1155
LID - 10.1038/tp.2017.115 [doi]
AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BOR) is determined by environmental and genetic 
      factors, and characterized by affective instability and impulsivity, diagnostic 
      symptoms also observed in manic phases of bipolar disorder (BIP). Up to 20% of 
      BIP patients show comorbidity with BOR. This report describes the first 
      case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BOR, performed in one of the 
      largest BOR patient samples worldwide. The focus of our analysis was (i) to 
      detect genes and gene sets involved in BOR and (ii) to investigate the genetic 
      overlap with BIP. As there is considerable genetic overlap between BIP, major 
      depression (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) and a high comorbidity of BOR and MDD, 
      we also analyzed the genetic overlap of BOR with SCZ and MDD. GWAS, gene-based 
      tests and gene-set analyses were performed in 998 BOR patients and 1545 controls. 
      Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to detect the genetic overlap 
      between BOR and these disorders. Single marker analysis revealed no significant 
      association after correction for multiple testing. Gene-based analysis yielded 
      two significant genes: DPYD (P=4.42 × 10(-7)) and PKP4 (P=8.67 × 10(-7)); and 
      gene-set analysis yielded a significant finding for exocytosis (GO:0006887, 
      P(FDR)=0.019; FDR, false discovery rate). Prior studies have implicated DPYD, 
      PKP4 and exocytosis in BIP and SCZ. The most notable finding of the present study 
      was the genetic overlap of BOR with BIP (r(g)=0.28 [P=2.99 × 10(-3)]), SCZ 
      (r(g)=0.34 [P=4.37 × 10(-5)]) and MDD (r(g)=0.57 [P=1.04 × 10(-3)]). We believe 
      our study is the first to demonstrate that BOR overlaps with BIP, MDD and SCZ on 
      the genetic level. Whether this is confined to transdiagnostic clinical symptoms 
      should be examined in future studies.

TI  - The First Organ-Based Ontology for Arthropods (Ontology of Arthropod Circulatory 
      Systems - OArCS) and its Integration into a Novel Formalization Scheme for 
      Morphological Descriptions.
PG  - 754-768
LID - 10.1093/sysbio/syw108 [doi]
AB  - Morphology, the oldest discipline in the biosciences, is currently experiencing a 
      renaissance in the field of comparative phenomics. However, 
      morphological/phenotypic research still suffers on various levels from a lack of 
      standards. This shortcoming, first highlighted as the "linguistic problem of 
      morphology", concerns the usage of terminology and also the need for 
      formalization of morphological descriptions themselves, something of paramount 
      importance not only to the field of morphology but also when it comes to the use 
      of phenotypic data in systematics and evolutionary biology. We therefore argue, 
      that for morphological descriptions, the basis of all systematic and evolutionary 
      interpretations, ontologies need to be utilized which are based exclusively on 
      structural qualities/properties and which in no case include statements about 
      homology and/or function. Statements about homology and function constitute 
      interpretations on a different or higher level. Based on these "anatomy 
      ontologies", further ontological dimensions (e.g., referring to functional 
      properties or homology) may be exerted for a broad use in evolutionary phenomics. 
      To this end we present the first organ-based ontology for the most species-rich 
      animal group, the Arthropoda. Our Ontology of Arthropod Circulatory Systems 
      (OArCS) contains a comprehensive collection of 383 terms (i.e., labels) tied to 
      296 concepts (i.e., definitions) collected from the literature on phenotypic 
      aspects of circulatory organ features in arthropods. All of the concepts used in 
      OArCS are based exclusively on structural features, and in the context of the 
      ontology are independent of homology and functional assumptions. We cannot rule 
      out that in some cases, terms are used which in traditional usage and previous 
      accounts might have implied homology and/or function (e.g. heart, sternal 
      artery). Concepts are composed of descriptive elements that are used to classify 
      observed instances into the organizational framework of the ontology. That is, 
      descriptions in ontologies are only descriptions of individuals if they are 
      necessary/and or sufficient representations of attributes (independently) 
      observed and recorded for an individual. In addition, we here present for the 
      first time an entirely new approach to formalizing phenotypic research, a 
      semantic model for the description of a complex organ system in a highly 
      disparate taxon, the arthropods. We demonstrate this with a formalized 
      morphological description of the hemolymph vascular system in one specimen of the 
      European garden spider Araneus diadematus. Our description targets five 
      categories of descriptive statement: "position", "spatial relationships", 
      "shape", "constituents", and "connections", as the corresponding formalizations 
      constitute exemplary patterns useful not only when talking about the circulatory 
      system, but also in descriptions in general. The downstream applications of 
      computer-parsable morphological descriptions are widespread, with their core 
      utility being the fact that they make it possible to compare collective 
      description sets in computational time, that is, very quickly. Among other 
      things, this facilitates the identification of phenotypic plasticity and 
      variation when single individuals are compared, the identification of those 
      traits which correlate between and within taxa, and the identification of links 
      between morphological traits and genetic (using GO, Gene Ontology) or 
      environmental (using ENVO, Environmental Ontology) factors. [Arthropoda; concept; 
      function; hemolymph vascular system; homology; terminology.].

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer survivors face dual challenges: long term sequelae of 
      treatment, and risk of recurrent disease. Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle 
      complicate both challenges. The WISER Survivor trial assessed the effects of 
      exercise and/or weight-loss on lymphedema, biomarkers of breast cancer 
      recurrence, and quality of life. We report on the innovative transdisciplinary 
      design of this trial and report attrition rates. METHODS: This one year trial 
      randomized breast cancer survivors who had a BMI of ≥25kg/m(2), were sedentary 
      and had breast-cancer-related-lymphedema to 1) exercise (weight training and 
      aerobic exercise) 2) weight-loss 3) exercise and weight-loss 4) or control group. 
      Innovative aspects included: adaptation of a community-based weight training 
      program to a largely home-based program; use of a commercial meal replacement 
      system as part of the lifestyle modification weight-loss program; inclusion of 
      measures of cost-effectiveness to enable economic evaluations; and alignment with 
      a parallel mouse model for breast cancer recurrence to enable transdisciplinary 
      research. In this model, mice bearing dormant residual tumor cells, which 
      spontaneously relapse, were placed on a high-fat diet. Overweight animals were 
      randomly assigned to exercise, calorie restriction, both, or control group and 
      followed for cancer recurrence. The animal model will guide mechanistic 
      biomarkers to be tested in the human trial. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: 351 
      participants were randomized; 13 experienced breast cancer recurrence during the 
      trial. Of the 338 participants without recurrence, 83% completed the trial. The 
      WISER Survivor trial will show the effects of exercise and weight-loss on 
      lymphedema outcomes, biomarkers of recurrence and quality of life. NCT 
      ClinicalTrials.gov registration #: NCT01515124.

AB  - Molecular mass distribution measurements by pulsed gradient spin echo nuclear 
      magnetic resonance (PGSE NMR) spectroscopy currently require prior knowledge of 
      scaling parameters to convert from polymer self-diffusion coefficient to 
      molecular mass. Reversing the problem, we utilize the scaling relation as prior 
      knowledge to uncover the scaling exponent from within the PGSE data. Thus, the 
      scaling exponent-a measure of polymer conformation and solvent quality-and the 
      dispersity (M(w)/M(n)) are obtainable from one simple PGSE experiment. The method 
      utilizes constraints and parametric distribution models in a two-step fitting 
      routine involving first the mass-weighted signal and second the number-weighted 
      signal. The method is developed using lognormal and gamma distribution models and 
      tested on experimental PGSE attenuation of the terminal methylene signal and on 
      the sum of all methylene signals of polyethylene glycol in D(2)O. Scaling 
      exponent and dispersity estimates agree with known values in the majority of 
      instances, leading to the potential application of the method to polymers for 
      which characterization is not possible with alternative techniques.

TI  - Severe clinical events in 100 patients with schizophrenia: a retrospective 
      clinical description using a system-specific psychopathological approach.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1080/08039488.2017.1368701 [doi]
AB  - Catatonic states and numerous other severe clinical events can complicate the 
      course of schizophrenia. Whether these severe courses are associated with 
      particular system-specific symptom dimensions remain unclear. Aim is to assess 
      the frequency of severe clinical events in a clinical population and to 
      investigate the association of these events with sociodemographic data and 
      system-specific psychopathology, combining qualitative and quantitative data. We 
      performed a comprehensive retrospective description of a well-described and 
      geographically stable sample of 100 patients with schizophrenia or 
      schizoaffective disorder and linked severe clinical events with sociodemographic 
      data at inclusion into the study (as indicators of social functioning) and 
      symptoms at first admission, classified with the Bern Psychopathology Scale 
      (BPS). We found 12 mentions of catatonic stupor or excitement, 45 of suicide 
      attempts, 26 of suicidality, 18 of deliberate self-harm, 18 of self-threatening 
      behaviour other than deliberate self-harm, 34 of violence against other persons, 
      18 of violence against objects and six of sexual harassment. Disinhibited 
      language on first admission seemed to be a protective factor against suicidality 
      and disinhibited motor behaviour seemed to predict self-threatening and violent 
      behaviour. Catatonia and violence in particular seemed to be socially disabling. 
      This exploratory study showed that the BPS is a promising instrument and might 
      represent a system-specific approach in identifying patients at risk for severe 
      sequelae of schizophrenia. This will have to be tested in future prospective 
      studies.

TI  - Evaluating phecodes, clinical classification software, and ICD-9-CM codes for

PG  - e0175508
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0175508 [doi]
LID - e0175508
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare three groupings of Electronic Health Record (EHR) billing 
      codes for their ability to represent clinically meaningful phenotypes and to 
      replicate known genetic associations. The three tested coding systems were the 
      International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
      (ICD-9-CM) codes, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical 
      Classification Software for ICD-9-CM (CCS), and manually curated "phecodes" 
      designed to facilitate phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) in EHRs. METHODS 
      AND MATERIALS: We selected 100 disease phenotypes and compared the ability of 
      each coding system to accurately represent them without performing additional 
      groupings. The 100 phenotypes included 25 randomly-chosen clinical phenotypes 
      pursued in prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and another 75 common 
      disease phenotypes mentioned across free-text problem lists from 189,289 
      individuals. We then evaluated the performance of each coding system to replicate 
      known associations for 440 SNP-phenotype pairs. RESULTS: Out of the 100 tested 
      clinical phenotypes, phecodes exactly matched 83, compared to 53 for ICD-9-CM and 
      32 for CCS. ICD-9-CM codes were typically too detailed (requiring custom 
      groupings) while CCS codes were often not granular enough. Among 440 tested known 
      SNP-phenotype associations, use of phecodes replicated 153 SNP-phenotype pairs 
      compared to 143 for ICD-9-CM and 139 for CCS. Phecodes also generally produced 
      stronger odds ratios and lower p-values for known associations than ICD-9-CM and 
      CCS. Finally, evaluation of several SNPs via PheWAS identified novel potential 
      signals, some seen in only using the phecode approach. Among them, rs7318369 in 
      PEPD was associated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Our results 
      suggest that the phecode groupings better align with clinical diseases mentioned 
      in clinical practice or for genomic studies. ICD-9-CM, CCS, and phecode groupings 
      all worked for PheWAS-type studies, though the phecode groupings produced 
      superior results.

AB  - Enhanced NRG1-ERBB4 signaling is a risk pathway in schizophrenia, and 
      corresponding mouse models display several endophenotypes of the disease. 
      Nonetheless, pathway-directed treatment strategies with clinically applicable 
      compounds have not been identified. Here, we applied a cell-based assay using the 
      split TEV technology to screen a library of clinically applicable compounds to 
      identify modulators of NRG1-ERBB4 signaling for repurposing. We recovered 
      spironolactone, known as antagonist of corticosteroids, as an inhibitor of the 
      ERBB4 receptor and tested it in pharmacological and biochemical assays to assess 
      secondary compound actions. Transgenic mice overexpressing Nrg1 type III display 
      cortical Erbb4 hyperphosphorylation, a condition observed in postmortem brains 
      from schizophrenia patients. Spironolactone treatment reverted 
      hyperphosphorylation of activated Erbb4 in these mice. In behavioral tests, 
      spironolactone treatment of Nrg1 type III transgenic mice ameliorated 
      schizophrenia-relevant behavioral endophenotypes, such as reduced sensorimotor 
      gating, hyperactivity, and impaired working memory. Moreover, spironolactone 
      increases spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in cortical slices 
      supporting an ERBB4-mediated mode-of-action. Our findings suggest that 
      spironolactone, a clinically safe drug, provides an opportunity for new treatment 
      options for schizophrenia.

AB  - Quantitative characterization of (13)C-labeled metabolites is an important part 
      of the stable isotope tracing method widely used in metabolic flux analysis. 
      Given the long relaxation time and low sensitivity of (13)C nuclei, direct 
      measurement of (13)C-labeled metabolites using one-dimensional (13)C NMR often 
      fails to meet the demand of metabolomics studies, especially with large numbers 
      of samples and metabolites having low abundance. Although HSQC-based 2D NMR 
      methods have improved sensitivity with inversion detection, they are 
      time-consuming and thus unsuitable for high-throughput absolute quantification of 
      (13)C-labeled metabolites. In this study, we developed a method for absolute 
      quantification of (13)C-labeled metabolites using naturally abundant TSP as a 
      reference with the first increment of the HMQC pulse sequence, taking 
      polarization transfer efficiencies into consideration. We validated this method 
      using a mixture of (13)C-labeled alanine, methionine, glucose, and formic acid 
      together with a mixture of alanine, lactate, glycine, uridine, cytosine, and 
      hypoxanthine, which have natural (13)C abundance with known concentrations. We 
      subsequently applied this method to analyze the flux of glucose in HepG2 cells 
      infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). The results showed that HBV infection 
      increased the cellular uptake of glucose, stimulated glycolysis, and enhanced the 
      pentose phosphate and hexosamine pathways for biosynthesis of RNA and DNA and 
      nucleotide sugars to facilitate HBV replication. This method saves experimental 
      time and provides a possibility for absolute quantitative tracking of the 
      (13)C-labeled metabolites for high-throughput studies.

TI  - Dedifferentiation, Proliferation, and Redifferentiation of Adult Mammalian 
      Cardiomyocytes After Ischemic Injury.
PG  - 834-848
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024307 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adult mammalian hearts have a limited ability to generate new 
      cardiomyocytes. Proliferation of existing adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs) is a 
      potential source of new cardiomyocytes. Understanding the fundamental biology of 
      ACM proliferation could be of great clinical significance for treating myocardial 
      infarction (MI). We aim to understand the process and regulation of ACM 
      proliferation and its role in new cardiomyocyte formation of post-MI mouse 
      hearts. METHODS: β-Actin-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice and 
      fate-mapping Myh6-MerCreMer-tdTomato/lacZ mice were used to trace the fate of 
      ACMs. In a coculture system with neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, ACM 
      proliferation was documented with clear evidence of cytokinesis observed with 
      time-lapse imaging. Cardiomyocyte proliferation in the adult mouse post-MI heart 
      was detected by cell cycle markers and 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine incorporation 
      analysis. Echocardiography was used to measure cardiac function, and histology 
      was performed to determine infarction size. RESULTS: In vitro, mononucleated and 
      bi/multinucleated ACMs were able to proliferate at a similar rate (7.0%) in the 
      coculture. Dedifferentiation proceeded ACM proliferation, which was followed by 
      redifferentiation. Redifferentiation was essential to endow the daughter cells 
      with cardiomyocyte contractile function. Intercellular propagation of Ca(2+) from 
      contracting neonatal rat ventricular myocytes into ACM daughter cells was 
      required to activate the Ca(2+)-dependent calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated 
      T-cell signaling pathway to induce ACM redifferentiation. The properties of 
      neonatal rat ventricular myocyte Ca(2+) transients influenced the rate of ACM 
      redifferentiation. Hypoxia impaired the function of gap junctions by 
      dephosphorylating its component protein connexin 43, the major mediator of 
      intercellular Ca(2+) propagation between cardiomyocytes, thereby impairing ACM 
      redifferentiation. In vivo, ACM proliferation was found primarily in the MI 
      border zone. An ischemia-resistant connexin 43 mutant enhanced the 
      redifferentiation of ACM-derived new cardiomyocytes after MI and improved cardiac 
      function. CONCLUSIONS: Mature ACMs can reenter the cell cycle and form new 
      cardiomyocytes through a 3-step process: dedifferentiation, proliferation, and 
      redifferentiation. Intercellular Ca(2+) signal from neighboring functioning 
      cardiomyocytes through gap junctions induces the redifferentiation process. This 
      novel mechanism contributes to new cardiomyocyte formation in post-MI hearts in 
      mammals.

AB  - The linkage between electronic health records (EHRs) and genotype data makes it 
      plausible to study the genetic susceptibility of a wide range of disease 
      phenotypes. Despite that EHR-derived phenotype data are subjected to 
      misclassification, it has been shown useful for discovering susceptible genes, 
      particularly in the setting of phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). It is 
      essential to characterize discovered associations using gold standard phenotype 
      data by chart review. In this work, we propose a genotype stratified case-control 
      sampling strategy to select subjects for phenotype validation. We develop a 
      closed-form maximum-likelihood estimator for the odds ratio parameters and a 
      score statistic for testing genetic association using the combined validated and 
      error-prone EHR-derived phenotype data, and assess the extent of power 
      improvement provided by this approach. Compared with case-control sampling based 
      only on EHR-derived phenotype data, our genotype stratified strategy maintains 
      nominal type I error rates, and result in higher power for detecting 
      associations. It also corrects the bias in the odds ratio parameter estimates, 
      and reduces the corresponding variance especially when the minor allele frequency 
      is small.

TI  - Simultaneous Quantification of Amino Metabolites in Multiple Metabolic Pathways 
      Using Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Tandem-mass Spectrometry.
PG  - 1423

AB  - Metabolites containing amino groups cover multiple pathways and play important 
      roles in redox homeostasis and biosyntheses of proteins, nucleotides and 
      neurotransmitters. Here, we report a new method for simultaneous quantification 
      of 124 such metabolites. This is achieved by derivatization-assisted sensitivity 
      enhancement with 5-aminoisoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (5-AIQC) 
      followed with comprehensive analysis using ultra-high performance liquid 
      chromatography and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry 
      (UHPLC-MS/MS). In an one-pot manner, this quantification method enables 
      simultaneous coverage of 20 important metabolic pathways including protein 
      biosynthesis/degradation, biosyntheses of catecholamines, arginine and 
      glutathione, metabolisms of homocysteine, taurine-hypotaurine etc. Compared with 
      the reported ones, this method is capable of simultaneously quantifying thiols, 
      disulfides and other oxidation-prone analytes in a single run and suitable for 
      quantifying aromatic amino metabolites. This method is also much more sensitive 
      for all tested metabolites with LODs well below 50 fmol (at sub-fmol for most 
      tested analytes) and shows good precision for retention time and quantitation 
      with inter-day and intra-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 15% and 
      good recovery from renal cancer tissue, rat urine and plasma. The method was 
      further applied to quantify the amino metabolites in silkworm hemolymph from 
      multiple developmental stages showing its applicability in metabolomics and 
      perhaps some clinical chemistry studies.

TI  - Histone demethylase UTX counteracts glucocorticoid deregulation of osteogenesis 
      by modulating histone-dependent and -independent pathways.

AB  - Excess glucocorticoid administration impairs osteogenic activities, which raises 
      the risk of osteoporotic disorders. Epigenetic methylation of DNA and histone 
      regulates the lineage commitment of progenitor cells. This study was undertaken 
      to delineate the actions of histone lysine demethylase 6a (UTX) with regard to 
      the glucocorticoid impediment of osteogenic differentiation. Osteogenic 
      progenitor cells responded to supraphysiological glucocorticoid by elevating CpG 
      dinucleotide methylation proximal to transcription start sites within Runx2 and 
      osterix promoters and Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) expression concomitant with 
      low UTX expression. 5'-Aza-deoxycystidine demethylation of Runx2 and osterix 
      promoters abolished the glucocorticoid inhibition of mineralized matrix 
      accumulation. Gain of UTX function attenuated the glucocorticoid-induced loss of 
      osteogenic differentiation, whereas UTX silencing escalated adipogenic gene 
      expression and adipocyte formation. UTX sustained osteogenic gene transcription 
      through maintaining its occupancy to Runx2 and osterix promoters. It also 
      mitigated the trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), which reduced 
      H3K27me3 enrichment to Dkk1 promoter and thereby lowered Dkk1 transcription. 
      Modulation of β-catenin and Dkk1 actions restored UTX signaling in 
      glucocorticoid-stressed cells. In vivo, UTX inhibition by exogenous 
      methylprednisolone and GSK-J4 administration, an effect that disturbed H3K27me3, 
      β-catenin, Dkk1, Runx2, and osterix levels, exacerbated trabecular 
      microarchitecture loss and marrow adiposity. Taken together, glucocorticoid 
      reduction of UTX function hindered osteogenic differentiation. Epigenetic 
      hypomethylation of osteogenic transcription factor promoters and H3K27 
      contributed to the UXT alleviation of Dkk1 transcription and osteogenesis in 
      glucocorticoid-stressed osteogenic progenitor cells. Control of UTX action has an 
      epigenetic perspective of curtailing glucocorticoid impairment of osteogenic 
      differentiation and bone mass. KEY MESSAGES: UTX attenuates glucocorticoid 
      deregulation of osteogenesis and adipogenesis. UTX reduces Runx2 promoter 
      methylation and H3K27me3 enrichment in the Dkk1 promoter. β-catenin and Dkk1 
      modulate the glucocorticoid inhibition of UTX signaling. UTX inhibition 
      exacerbates bone mass, trabecular microstructure and fatty marrow. UTX signaling 
      is indispensable in fending off glucocorticoid-impaired osteogenesis.

TI  - Morphological phenotyping and genetic analyses of a new chemical-mutagenized 
      population of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.).
PG  - 149-163

AB  - A novel tobacco mutant library was constructed, screened, and characterized as a 
      crucial genetic resource for functional genomics and applied research. A 
      comprehensive mutant library is a fundamental resource for investigating gene 
      functions, especially after the completion of genome sequencing. A new tobacco 
      mutant population induced by ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis was developed 
      for functional genomics applications. We isolated 1607 mutant lines and 8610 
      mutant plants with altered morphological phenotypes from 5513 independent M2 
      families that consisted of 69,531 M2 plants. The 2196 mutations of abnormal 
      phenotypes in the M2 putative mutants were classified into four groups with 17 
      major categories and 51 subcategories. More than 60% of the abnormal phenotypes 
      observed fell within the five major categories including plant height, leaf 
      shape, leaf surface, leaf color, and flowering time. The 465 M2 mutants exhibited 
      multiple phenotypes, and 1054 of the 2196 mutations were pleiotropic. 
      Verification of the phenotypes in advanced generations indicated that 70.63% of 
      the M3 lines, 84.87% of the M4 lines, and 95.75% of the M5 lines could transmit 
      original mutant phenotypes of the corresponding M2, M3, and M4 mutant plants. 
      Along with the increased generation of mutants, the ratios of lines inheriting 
      OMPs increased and lines with emerging novel mutant phenotypes decreased. Genetic 
      analyses of 18 stably heritable mutants showed that two mutants were double 
      recessive, five were monogenic recessive, eight presented monogenic dominant 
      inheritance, and three presented semi-dominant inheritance. The pleiotropy 
      pattern, saturability evaluation, research prospects of genome, and phenome of 
      the mutant populations were also discussed. Simultaneously, this novel mutant 
      library provided a fundamental resource for investigating gene functions in 
      tobacco.

TI  - Semi-supervised determination of pseudocryptic morphotypes using observer-free 
      characterizations of anatomical alignment and shape.
PG  - 5041-5055

AB  - Accurate, quantitative characterization of complex shapes is recognized as a key 
      methodological challenge in biology. Recent development of automated 
      three-dimensional geometric morphometric protocols (auto3dgm) provides a 
      promising set of tools to help address this challenge. While auto3dgm has been 
      shown to be useful in characterizing variation across clades of morphologically 
      very distinct mammals, it has not been adequately tested in more problematic 
      cases where pseudolandmark placement error potentially confounds interpretation 
      of true shape variation. Here, we tested the sensitivity of auto3dgm to the 
      degree of variation and various parameterization settings using a simulation and 
      three microCT datasets that characterize mammal tooth crown morphology as 
      biological examples. The microCT datasets vary in degree of apparent 
      morphological differentiation, with two that include grossly similar 
      morphospecies and one that includes two laboratory strains of a single species. 
      Resulting alignments are highly sensitive to the number of pseudolandmarks used 
      to quantify shapes. The degree to which the surfaces were downsampled and the 
      apparent degree of morphological differentiation across the dataset also 
      influenced alignment repeatability. We show that previous critiques of auto3dgm 
      were based on poorly parameterized alignments and suggest that sample-specific 
      sensitivity analyses should be added to any research protocol including auto3dgm. 
      Auto3dgm is a useful tool for studying samples when pseudolandmark placement 
      error is small relative to the true differences between specimens. This method 
      therefore represents a promising avenue forward in morphometric studies at a wide 
      range of scales, from samples that differ by a single genetic locus to samples 
      that represent multiple phylogenetically diverse clades.

      are commonly associated with a more severe phenotype, compared to cardiac myosin 
      binding protein-C (MYBPC3) gene mutations with milder phenotype, incomplete 
      penetrance and later age of onset. Compound mutations can worsen the phenotype. 
      This study aimed to validate these comparative differences in a large cohort of 
      individuals and families with HCM. We performed genome-phenome correlation among 
      80 symptomatic HCM patients, 35 asymptomatic carriers and 35 non-carriers, using 
      an 18-gene clinical diagnostic HCM panel. A total of 125 mutations were 
      identified in 14 genes. MYBPC3 and MYH7 mutations contributed to 50.0% and 24.4% 
      of the HCM patients, respectively, suggesting that MYBPC3 mutations were the most 
      frequent cause of HCM in our cohort. Double mutations were found in only nine HCM 
      patients (7.8%) who were phenotypically indistinguishable from single-mutation 
      carriers. Comparisons of clinical parameters of MYBPC3 and MYH7 mutants were not 
      statistically significant, but asymptomatic carriers had high left ventricular 
      ejection fraction and diastolic dysfunction when compared to non-carriers. The 
      presence of double mutations increases the risk for symptomatic HCM with no 
      change in severity, as determined in this study subset. The pathologic effects of 
      MYBPC3 and MYH7 were found to be independent of gene mutation location. 
      Furthermore, HCM pathology is independent of protein domain disruption in both 
      MYBPC3 and MYH7. These data provide evidence that MYBPC3 mutations constitute the 
      preeminent cause of HCM and that they are phenotypically indistinguishable from 
      HCM caused by MYH7 mutations.

AB  - The metabolome describes the full complement of the tens to hundreds of thousands 
      of low molecular weight metabolites present within a biological system. 
      Identification of the metabolome is critical for discovering the maximum amount 
      of biochemical knowledge from metabolomics datasets. Yet no exhaustive 
      experimental characterisation of any organismal metabolome has been reported to 
      date, dramatically contrasting with the genome sequencing of thousands of plants, 
      animals and microbes. Here, we review the status of metabolome annotation and 
      describe advances in the analytical methodologies being applied. In part through 
      new international coordination, we conclude that we are now entering a new era of 
      metabolome annotation.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over many decades, researchers have been designing studies to 
      investigate the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes to gain an 
      understanding about the effect of genetics on disease. Recently, a 
      high-throughput approach called phenome-wide associations studies (PheWAS) have 
      been extensively used to identify associations between genetic variants and many 
      diseases and traits simultaneously. In this review, we describe the value of 
      PheWAS along with methodological issues and challenges in interpretation for 
      current applications of PheWAS. RECENT FINDINGS: PheWAS have uncovered a paradigm 
      to identify new associations for genetic loci across many diseases. The 
      application of PheWAS have been effective with phenotype data from electronic 
      health records, epidemiological studies, and clinical trials data. SUMMARY: The 
      key strength of a PheWAS is to identify the association of one or more genetic 
      variants with multiple phenotypes, which can showcase interconnections among the 
      phenotypes due to shared genetic associations. While the PheWAS approach appears 
      promising, there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed to provide 
      additional robustness to PheWAS findings.

AB  - Aging involves a progressive decline of metabolic function and an increased 
      incidence of late-onset degenerative disorders and cancer. To a large extent, 
      these processes are influenced by alterations affecting the integrity of genome 
      architecture and, ultimately, its phenotypic expression. Despite the progress 
      made towards establishing causal links between genomic and epigenomic changes and 
      aging, mechanisms underlying metabolic dysregulation and age-related phenotypes 
      remain obscure. Here, we present a model linking genome-wide changes and their 
      age-related phenotypic consequences via the alteration of macromolecular 
      complexes and cellular networks. This approach may provide a better understanding 
      of the dynamically changing genome-phenome map with age, but also deeper insights 
      to developing more targeted therapies to prevent and/or manage late-onset 
      degenerative disorders as well as decelerate aging.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polyphosphate (polyP) is a linear biopolymer found in all living 
      cells. In bacteria, mutants lacking polyphosphate kinase 1 (PPK1), the enzyme 
      responsible for synthesis of most polyP, have many structural and functional 
      defects. However, little is known about the causes of these pleiotropic 
      alterations. The link between ppk1 deletion and those numerous phenotypes 
      observed can be the result of complex molecular interactions that can be 
      elucidated via a systems biology approach. METHODS: By integrating different 
      omics levels (transcriptome, proteome and phenome), we described the functioning 
      of various metabolic pathways among Escherichia coli polyphosphate mutant strains 
      (Δppk1, Δppx, and ΔpolyP). Bioinformatic analyses reveal the complex metabolic 
      and regulatory bases of the phenotypes unique to polyP mutants. RESULTS: Our 
      results suggest that during polyP deficiency (Δppk1 mutant), metabolic pathways 
      needed for energy supply are up-regulated, including fermentation, aerobic and 
      anaerobic respiration. Transcriptomic and q-proteomic contrasting changes between 
      Δppk1 and Δppx mutant strains were observed in those central metabolic pathways 
      and confirmed by using Phenotypic microarrays. In addition, our results suggest a 
      regulatory connection between polyP, second messenger metabolism, alternative 
      Sigma/Anti-Sigma factors and type-II toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We suggest a broader role for polyP via regulation of ATP-dependent proteolysis 
      of type II toxin-antitoxin system and alternative Sigma/Anti-Sigma factors, that 
      could explain the multiple structural and functional deficiencies described due 
      to alteration of polyP metabolism. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding the 
      interplay of polyP in bacterial metabolism using a systems biology approach can 
      help to improve design of novel antimicrobials toward pathogens.

TI  - Microbial Detoxification of Deoxynivalenol (DON), Assessed via a Lemna minor L. 
      Bioassay, through Biotransformation to 3-epi-DON and 3-epi-DOM-1.
LID - 10.3390/toxins9020063 [doi]

AB  - Mycotoxins are toxic metabolites produced by fungi. To mitigate mycotoxins in 
      food or feed, biotransformation is an emerging technology in which microorganisms 
      degrade toxins into non-toxic metabolites. To monitor deoxynivalenol (DON) 
      biotransformation, analytical tools such as ELISA and liquid chromatography 
      coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) are typically used. However, these 
      techniques do not give a decisive answer about the remaining toxicity of possible 
      biotransformation products. Hence, a bioassay using Lemna minor L. was developed. 
      A dose-response analysis revealed significant inhibition in the growth of L. 
      minor exposed to DON concentrations of 0.25 mg/L and higher. Concentrations above 
      1 mg/L were lethal for the plant. This bioassay is far more sensitive than 
      previously described systems. The bioassay was implemented to screen microbial 
      enrichment cultures, originating from rumen fluid, soil, digestate and activated 
      sludge, on their biotransformation and detoxification capability of DON. The 
      enrichment cultures originating from soil and activated sludge were capable of 
      detoxifying and degrading 5 and 50 mg/L DON. In addition, the metabolites 
      3-epi-DON and the epimer of de-epoxy-DON (3-epi-DOM-1) were found as 
      biotransformation products of both consortia. Our work provides a new valuable 
      tool to screen microbial cultures for their detoxification capacity.

TI  - CXCL9-Derived Peptides Differentially Inhibit Neutrophil Migration In Vivo 
      through Interference with Glycosaminoglycan Interactions.
PG  - 530

AB  - Several acute and chronic inflammatory diseases are driven by accumulation of 
      activated leukocytes due to enhanced chemokine expression. In addition to 
      specific G protein-coupled receptor-dependent signaling, 
      chemokine-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) interactions are important for chemokine 
      activity in vivo. Therefore, the GAG-chemokine interaction has been explored as 
      target for inhibition of chemokine activity. It was demonstrated that 
      CXCL9(74-103) binds with high affinity to GAGs, competed with active chemokines 
      for GAG binding and thereby inhibited CXCL8- and monosodium urate (MSU) 
      crystal-induced neutrophil migration to joints. To evaluate the affinity and 
      specificity of the COOH-terminal part of CXCL9 toward different GAGs in detail, 
      we chemically synthesized several COOH-terminal CXCL9 peptides including the 
      shorter CXCL9(74-93). Compared to CXCL9(74-103), CXCL9(74-93) showed equally high 
      affinity for heparin and heparan sulfate (HS), but lower affinity for binding to 
      chondroitin sulfate (CS) and cellular GAGs. Correspondingly, both peptides 
      competed with equal efficiency for CXCL8 binding to heparin and HS but not to 
      cellular GAGs. In addition, differences in anti-inflammatory activity between 
      both peptides were detected in vivo. CXCL8-induced neutrophil migration to the 
      peritoneal cavity and to the knee joint were inhibited with similar potency by 
      intravenous or intraperitoneal injection of CXCL9(74-103) or CXCL9(74-93), but 
      not by CXCL9(86-103). In contrast, neutrophil extravasation in the MSU 
      crystal-induced gout model, in which multiple chemoattractants are induced, was 
      not affected by CXCL9(74-93). This could be explained by (1) the lower affinity 
      of CXCL9(74-93) for CS, the most abundant GAG in joints, and (2) by reduced 
      competition with GAG binding of CXCL1, the most abundant ELR(+) CXC chemokine in 
      this gout model. Mechanistically we showed by intravital microscopy that 
      fluorescent CXCL9(74-103) coats the vessel wall in vivo and that CXCL9(74-103) 
      inhibits CXCL8-induced adhesion of neutrophils to the vessel wall in the murine 
      cremaster muscle model. Thus, both affinity and specificity of chemokines and the 
      peptides for different GAGs and the presence of specific GAGs in different 
      tissues will determine whether competition can occur. In summary, both CXCL9 
      peptides inhibited neutrophil migration in vivo through interference with GAG 
      interactions in several animal models. Shortening CXCL9(74-103) from the 
      COOH-terminus limited its GAG-binding spectrum.

TI  - Genetic Divergence and Chemotype Diversity in the Fusarium Head Blight Pathogen 
      Fusarium poae.
LID - 10.3390/toxins9090255 [doi]
LID - 255
AB  - Fusarium head blight is a disease caused by a complex of Fusarium species. F. 
      poae is omnipresent throughout Europe in spite of its low virulence. In this 
      study, we assessed a geographically diverse collection of F. poae isolates for 
      its genetic diversity using AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism). 
      Furthermore, studying the mating type locus and chromosomal insertions, we 
      identified hallmarks of both sexual recombination and clonal spread of successful 
      genotypes in the population. Despite the large genetic variation found, all F. 
      poae isolates possess the nivalenol chemotype based on Tri7 sequence analysis. 
      Nevertheless, Tri gene clusters showed two layers of genetic variability. 
      Firstly, the Tri1 locus was highly variable with mostly synonymous mutations and 
      mutations in introns pointing to a strong purifying selection pressure. Secondly, 
      in a subset of isolates, the main trichothecene gene cluster was invaded by a 
      transposable element between Tri5 and Tri6. To investigate the impact of these 
      variations on the phenotypic chemotype, mycotoxin production was assessed on 
      artificial medium. Complex blends of type A and type B trichothecenes were 
      produced but neither genetic variability in the Tri genes nor variability in the 
      genome or geography accounted for the divergence in trichothecene production. In 
      view of its complex chemotype, it will be of utmost interest to uncover the role 
      of trichothecenes in virulence, spread and survival of F. poae.

AB  - Metabolomics, the youngest of the major omics technologies, is supported by an 
      active community of researchers and infrastructure developers across Europe. To 
      coordinate and focus efforts around infrastructure building for metabolomics 
      within Europe, a workshop on the "Future of metabolomics in ELIXIR" was organised 
      at Frankfurt Airport in Germany. This one-day strategic workshop involved 
      representatives of ELIXIR Nodes, members of the PhenoMeNal consortium developing 
      an e-infrastructure that supports workflow-based metabolomics analysis pipelines, 
      and experts from the international metabolomics community. The workshop 
      established metabolite identification as the critical area, where a maximal 
      impact of computational metabolomics and data management on other fields could be 
      achieved. In particular, the existing four ELIXIR Use Cases, where the 
      metabolomics community - both industry and academia - would benefit most, and 
      which could be exhaustively mapped onto the current five ELIXIR Platforms were 
      discussed. This opinion article is a call for support for a new ELIXIR 
      metabolomics Use Case, which aligns with and complements the existing and planned 
      ELIXIR Platforms and Use Cases.

TI  - The pathophysiology of human obstructive cholestasis is mimicked in cholestatic 
      Gold Syrian hamsters.

AB  - Obstructive cholestasis causes liver injury via accumulation of toxic bile acids 
      (BAs). Therapeutic options for cholestatic liver disease are limited, partially 
      because the available murine disease models lack translational value. Profiling 
      of time-related changes following bile duct ligation (BDL) in Gold Syrian 
      hamsters revealed a biochemical response similar to cholestatic patients in terms 
      of BA pool composition, alterations in hepatocyte BA transport and signaling, 
      suppression of BA production, and adapted BA metabolism. Hamsters tolerated 
      cholestasis well for up to 28days and progressed relatively slowly to fibrotic 
      liver injury. Hepatocellular necrosis was absent, which coincided with preserved 
      intrahepatic energy levels and only mild oxidative stress. The histological 
      response to cholestasis in hamsters was similar to the changes seen in 17 
      patients with prolonged obstructive cholestasis caused by cholangiocarcinoma. 
      Hamsters moreover upregulated hepatic fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15) 
      expression in response to BDL, which is a cytoprotective adaptation to 
      cholestasis that hitherto had only been documented in cholestatic human livers. 
      Hamster models should therefore be added to the repertoire of animal models used 
      to study the pathophysiology of cholestatic liver disease.

AB  - Plant phenomics has received increasing interest in recent years in an attempt to 
      bridge the genotype-to-phenotype knowledge gap. There is a need for expanded 
      high-throughput phenotyping capabilities to keep up with an increasing amount of 
      data from high-dimensional imaging sensors and the desire to measure more complex 
      phenotypic traits (Knecht et al., 2016). In this paper, we introduce an 
      open-source deep learning tool called Deep Plant Phenomics. This tool provides 
      pre-trained neural networks for several common plant phenotyping tasks, as well 
      as an easy platform that can be used by plant scientists to train models for 
      their own phenotyping applications. We report performance results on three plant 
      phenotyping benchmarks from the literature, including state of the art 
      performance on leaf counting, as well as the first published results for the 
      mutant classification and age regression tasks for Arabidopsis thaliana.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improve phenotype definition in genetic studies of epilepsy, we 
      assessed the familial aggregation of focal seizure types and of specific seizure 
      symptoms within the focal epilepsies in families from the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome 
      Project. METHODS: We studied 302 individuals with nonacquired focal epilepsy from 
      149 families. Familial aggregation was assessed by logistic regression analysis 
      of relatives' traits (dependent variable) by probands' traits (independent 
      variable), estimating the odds ratio for each symptom in a relative given 
      presence vs absence of the symptom in the proband. RESULTS: In families 
      containing multiple individuals with nonacquired focal epilepsy, we found 
      significant evidence for familial aggregation of ictal motor, autonomic, psychic, 
      and aphasic symptoms. Within these categories, ictal whole body posturing, 
      diaphoresis, dyspnea, fear/anxiety, and déjà vu/jamais vu showed significant 
      familial aggregation. Focal seizure type aggregated as well, including complex 
      partial, simple partial, and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results provide insight into genotype-phenotype correlation in 
      the nonacquired focal epilepsies and a framework for identifying subgroups of 
      patients likely to share susceptibility genes.

TI  - The Importance of Endophenotypes to Evaluate the Relationship between Genotype 
      and External Phenotype.
LID - 10.3390/ijms18020472 [doi]
LID - 472
AB  - With the exception of a few Mendelian traits, almost all phenotypes (traits) in 
      livestock science are quantitative or complex traits regulated by the expression 
      of many genes. For most of the complex traits, differential expression of genes, 
      rather than genomic variation in the gene coding sequences, is associated with 
      the genotype of a trait. The expression profiles of the animal's transcriptome, 
      proteome and metabolome represent endophenotypes that influence/regulate the 
      externally-observed phenotype. These expression profiles are generated by 
      interactions between the animal's genome and its environment that range from the 
      cellular, up to the husbandry environment. Thus, understanding complex traits 
      requires knowledge about not only genomic variation, but also environmental 
      effects that affect genome expression. Gene products act together in 
      physiological pathways and interaction networks (of pathways). Due to the lack of 
      annotation of the functional genome and ontologies of genes, our knowledge about 
      the various biological systems that contribute to the development of external 
      phenotypes is sparse. Furthermore, interaction with the animals' microbiome, 
      especially in the gut, greatly influences the external phenotype. We conclude 
      that a detailed understanding of complex traits requires not only understanding 
      of variation in the genome, but also its expression at all functional levels.

AB  - Major improvements in crop yield are needed to keep pace with population growth 
      and climate change. While plant breeding efforts have greatly benefited from 
      advances in genomics, profiling the crop phenome (i.e., the structure and 
      function of plants) associated with allelic variants and environments remains a 
      major technical bottleneck. Here, we review the conceptual and technical 
      challenges facing plant phenomics. We first discuss how, given plants' high 
      levels of morphological plasticity, crop phenomics presents distinct challenges 
      compared with studies in animals. Next, we present strategies for multi-scale 
      phenomics, and describe how major improvements in imaging, sensor technologies 
      and data analysis are now making high-throughput root, shoot, whole-plant and 
      canopy phenomic studies possible. We then suggest that research in this area is 
      entering a new stage of development, in which phenomic pipelines can help 
      researchers transform large numbers of images and sensor data into knowledge, 
      necessitating novel methods of data handling and modelling. Collectively, these 
      innovations are helping accelerate the selection of the next generation of crops 
      more sustainable and resilient to climate change, and whose benefits promise to 
      scale from physiology to breeding and to deliver real world impact for ongoing 
      global food security efforts.

AB  - Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) is a secretory protein that can be cleaved to form 
      an N-terminal and a C-terminal protein. Studies performed thus far have linked 
      ANGPTL4 to several cancer-related and metabolic processes. Notably, several point 
      mutations in the C-terminal ANGPTL4 (cANGPTL4) have been reported, although no 
      studies have been performed that ascribed these mutations to cancer-related and 
      metabolic processes. In this study, we compared the characteristics of tumors 
      with and without wild-type (wt) cANGPTL4 and tumors with cANGPTL4 bearing the 
      T266M mutation (T266M cANGPTL4). We found that T266M cANGPTL4 bound to integrin 
      α5β1 with a reduced affinity compared to wt, leading to weaker activation of 
      downstream signaling molecules. The mutant tumors exhibited impaired 
      proliferation, anoikis resistance, and migratory capability and had reduced 
      adenylate energy charge. Further investigations also revealed that cANGPTL4 
      regulated the expression of Glut2. These findings may explain the differences in 
      the tumor characteristics and energy metabolism observed with the cANGPTL4 T266M 
      mutation compared to tumors without the mutation.

      profiles of erythrocytes from heart failure (HF) patients are informative of 
      their disease risk. The lipidomes of erythrocytes from 10 control subjects and 29 
      patients at different HF stages were analyzed using liquid chromatography 
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The lipid composition of erythrocytes obtained 
      from HF patients was significantly different from that of normal controls. The 
      levels of phosphatidylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), and 
      sphingomyelins decreased in HF erythrocytes as compared with those of control 
      subjects; however, the levels of lysoPCs, lysoPEs, and ceramides increased in HF 
      erythrocytes. Notably, the oxidized cholesterol 7-ketocholesterol (7KCh) 
      accumulated to higher level in HF erythrocytes than in plasma from the same 
      patients. We further validated our findings with a cohort of 115 subjects of 
      control subjects (n=28) and patients (n=87). Mechanistically, 7KCh promoted 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in cardiomyocytes; and induced their 
      death, probably through an ATF4-dependent pathway. Our findings suggest that 
      erythrocytic 7KCh can be a risk factor for HF, and is probably implicated in its 
      pathophysiology.

AB  - Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is an inflammatory disease of the peripheral 
      nervous system. Given that plasma metabolic profiles in GBS patients have never 
      been explored, plasma samples of 38 GBS patients, 22 multiple sclerosis (MS) 
      patients, and 40 healthy controls were analyzed by using untargeted and targeted 
      metabolomics analysis. The untargeted analysis showed that levels of a set of 
      plasma lipid metabolites were significantly decreased in GBS patients compared to 
      the controls. Furthermore, the targeted analysis demonstrated that levels of 41 
      metabolites in GBS patients were significantly changed compared to either the 
      controls or MS patients. A further metabolic analysis showed that 12 of 41 
      metabolites were significantly lower in classical GBS patients compared to 
      Miller-Fisher syndrome. Among them, each of PCae C34:0, PCae C42:2, PCae C42:3, 
      and SM C24:0 was inversely correlated with Hughes functional grading scale of GBS 
      patients at both nadir and discharge. Receiver operating characteristic curve 
      analysis of combination of three metabolites (PCaa C42:2, PCae C36:0 and SM 
      C24:0) showed a good discrimination between the GBS and the controls (area under 
      curve = 0.86). This study has demonstrated disruption of lipid metabolites in GBS 
      may be potential biomarkers to indicate disease severity and prognosis of GBS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory polyneuropathy 
      resulting in demyelination in peripheral nervous system. Myelin enriched in 
      lipids is easily oxidized by reactive oxygen species during inflammation. 
      Oxidative stress and lipophilic anti-oxidative capacities in GBS patients have 
      not been fully explored. To evaluate the redox status of GBS patients, we 
      measured malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), lipophilic antioxidants, 
      and tocopherols concentrations in plasma from GBS patients and age-matched 
      healthy controls. RESULTS: Concentrations of γ-tocopherol and δ-tocopherol 
      decreased significantly, and α-carotene significantly increased in GBS patients 
      compared to healthy controls. However, no significant changes in MDA and MPO 
      concentrations were detected. In GBS patients, the γ-tocopherol concentration 
      correlated positively with concentrations of δ-tocopherol, α-tocopherol, lutein, 
      Q10, and γ-CEHC, respectively. Similarly, the δ-tocopherol concentration 
      correlated positively with γ-tocopherol, α-tocopherol, lutein, Q10, δ-CEHC, and 
      γ-CEHC concentrations, respectively. The receiver operating characteristics curve 
      analysis showed that γ-tocopherol may serve as a good predictor for GBS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Diminished lipophilic antioxidant defense, mainly γ-tocopherol and 
      δ-tocopherol, in GBS patients accounting for their lowered resistance to reactive 
      oxygen species is probably associated with pathogenesis of GBS, and potentially 
      useful for the development of therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Metabolite profiling in identifying metabolic biomarkers in older people with 
      late-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Regulation of blood glucose requires precise coordination between different 
      endocrine systems and multiple organs. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) arises from 
      a dysregulated response to elevated glucose levels in the circulation. Globally, 
      the prevalence of T2D has increased dramatically in all age groups. T2D in older 
      adults is associated with higher mortality and reduced functional status, leading 
      to higher rate of institutionalization. Despite the potential healthcare 
      challenges associated with the presence of T2D in the elderly, the pathogenesis 
      and phenotype of late-onset T2D is not well studied. Here we applied untargeted 
      metabolite profiling of urine samples from people with and without late-onset T2D 
      using ultra-performance liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to 
      identify urinary biomarkers for late-onset T2D in the elderly. Statistical 
      modeling of measurements and thorough validation of structural assignment using 
      liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) have led to the 
      identification of metabolite biomarkers associated with late-onset T2D. Lower 
      levels of phenylalanine, acetylhistidine, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
      (cAMP) were found in urine samples of T2D subjects validated with commercial 
      standards. Elevated levels of 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), which previously has 
      only been implicated in animal model of diabetes, was found in urine of older 
      people with T2D.

AB  - Salinity represents an abiotic stress constraint affecting growth and 
      productivity of plants in many regions of the world. One of the possible 
      solutions is to improve the level of salt resistance using natural genetic 
      variability within crop species. In the context of recent knowledge on salt 
      stress effects and mechanisms of salt tolerance, this review present useful 
      phenomic approach employing different non-invasive imaging systems for detection 
      of quantitative and qualitative changes caused by salt stress at the plant and 
      canopy level. The focus is put on hyperspectral imaging technique, which provides 
      unique opportunities for fast and reliable estimate of numerous characteristics 
      associated both with various structural, biochemical and physiological traits. 
      The method also provides possibilities to combine plant and canopy analyses with 
      a direct determination of salinity in soil. The future perspectives in salt 
      stress applications as well as some limits of the method are also identified.

TI  - Ci-AMBP: a highly conserved member of the microglobulin superfamily of proteinase 
      inhibitors in grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idellus.
PG  - 251-256
LID - 10.1266/ggs.16-00059 [doi]
AB  - A full-length cDNA clone encoding grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) 
      α1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor (Ci-AMBP) was isolated by subtracted 
      differential hybridization screening from a liver cDNA library. The deduced amino 
      acid sequence shared approximately 50% sequence identity with its mammalian 
      counterparts, but more than 90% identity with another fish species. AMBPs are the 
      precursors of the plasma glycoproteins α1-microglobulin (α1m) and bikunin. Both 
      peptide structures and their chromosomal organization were well conserved in 
      Ci-AMBP. The α1m and bikunin polypeptides are separated by the typical 
      tetrapeptide R-A-R-R that provides an endoproteolytic cleavage site for 
      maturation. The genetic organization of domains and functional motifs indicated 
      that Ci-AMBP is a typical member of the lipocalin and Kunitz-type protease 
      inhibitor superfamilies. Expression of the Ci-AMBP gene in different 
      tissues/organs was evaluated using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and, in contrast to 
      the restricted expression in other species, transcripts were detected in a wide 
      range of tissues. The most abundant expression occurred in the secretory organs, 
      which supports the roles of α1m and bikunin in the immune response to diseases 
      and in the stress response.

PG  - 77722-77733
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.20773 [doi]
AB  - Protein-bound uremic toxins, indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate, increase 
      oxidative stress and adversely affect chronic kidney disease progression and 
      cardiovascular complications. In this study, we examined whether mitochondria are 
      the target of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate intoxication in vivo and in 
      vitro. The kidneys of 10-week-old male B-6 mice with ½-nephrectomy treated with 
      indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate were used for the animal study. Cultured 
      human renal tubular cells were used for the in vitro study. Our results indicated 
      that indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate impaired aerobic and anaerobic 
      metabolism in vivo and in vitro. Indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate caused 
      mitochondrial fission by modulating the expression of mitochondrial 
      fission-fusion proteins. Mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired biogenesis could 
      be protected by treatment with antioxidants. The in vitro study also demonstrated 
      that indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate reduced mitochondrial mass by 
      activating autophagic machinery. In summary, our study suggests that 
      mitochondrial injury is one of the major pathological mechanisms for uremic 
      intoxication, which is related to chronic kidney disease and its complications.

TI  - Introgression from Populus balsamifera underlies adaptively significant variation 
      and range boundaries in P. trichocarpa.
PG  - 416-427
LID - 10.1111/nph.14779 [doi]
AB  - Introgression can be an important source of adaptive phenotypes, although 
      conversely it can have deleterious effects. Evidence for adaptive introgression 
      is accumulating but information on the genetic architecture of introgressed 
      traits lags behind. Here we determine trait architecture in Populus trichocarpa 
      under introgression from P. balsamifera using admixture mapping and phenotypic 
      analyses. Our results reveal that admixture is a key driver of clinal adaptation 
      and suggest that the northern range extension of P. trichocarpa depends, at least 
      in part, on introgression from P. balsamifera. However, admixture with 
      P. balsamifera can lead to potentially maladaptive early phenology, and a 
      reduction in growth and disease resistance in P. trichocarpa. Strikingly, an 
      introgressed chromosome 9 haplotype block from P. balsamifera restores the late 
      phenology and high growth parental phenotype in admixed P. trichocarpa. This 
      epistatic restorer block may be strongly advantageous in maximizing carbon 
      assimilation and disease resistance in the southernmost populations where 
      admixture has been detected. We also confirm a previously demonstrated case of 
      adaptive introgression in chromosome 15 and show that introgression generates a 
      transgressive chlorophyll-content phenotype. We provide strong support that 
      introgression provides a reservoir of genetic variation associated with adaptive 
      characters that allows improved survival in new environments.

TI  - Human chondroprogenitors in alginate-collagen hybrid scaffolds produce stable 
      cartilage in vivo.
PG  - 3014-3026
LID - 10.1002/term.2203 [doi]
AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate human epiphyseal chondroprogenitor cells 
      (ECPs) as a potential new cell source for cartilage regeneration. ECPs were 
      compared to human bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and human adult articular 
      chondrocytes (ACs) for their chondrogenic potential and phenotypic stability in 
      vitro and in vivo. The cells were seeded in Optimaix-3D scaffolds at 5 × 10(4) 
      cells/mm(3) and gene expression, matrix production and mechanical properties were 
      analysed up to 6 weeks. In vitro, ECPs synthesized consistently high collagen 2 
      and low collagen 10. AC-seeded constructs exhibited high donor variability in 
      GAG/DNA values as well as in collagen 2 staining, but showed low collagen 10 
      production. MSCs, on the other hand, expressed high levels of collagen 2 but also 
      of collagens 1 and 10, and were therefore not considered further. In vivo, there 
      was considerable loss of matrix proteins in ECPs compared to in vitro cultured 
      samples. To overcome this, a second implantation study investigated the effect of 
      mixing cells with alginate prior to seeding in the scaffold. ECPs in alginate 
      maintained their cartilage matrix and resisted mineralization and vessel 
      infiltration better 6 weeks after subcutaneous implantation, whereas ACs lost 
      their chondrogenic matrix completely. This study shows the great potential of 
      ECPs as an off-the-shelf, highly chondrogenic cell type that produces stable 
      cartilage in vivo. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Initiative (HipSci) isf establishing a 
      large catalogue of human iPSC lines, arguably the most well characterized 
      collection to date. The HipSci portal enables researchers to choose the right 
      cell line for their experiment, and makes HipSci's rich catalogue of assay data 
      easy to discover and reuse. Each cell line has genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic

AB  - Phenotyping for photosynthetic gas exchange parameters is limiting our ability to 
      select plants for enhanced photosynthetic carbon gain and to assess plant 
      function in current and future natural environments. This is due, in part, to the 
      time required to generate estimates of the maximum rate of 
      ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco) carboxylation (V(c,max) 
      ) and the maximal rate of electron transport (J(max) ) from the response of 
      photosynthesis (A) to the CO(2) concentration inside leaf air spaces (C(i) ). To 
      relieve this bottleneck, we developed a method for rapid photosynthetic carbon 
      assimilation CO(2) responses [rapid A-C(i) response (RACiR)] utilizing 
      non-steady-state measurements of gas exchange. Using high temporal resolution 
      measurements under rapidly changing CO(2) concentrations, we show that RACiR 
      techniques can obtain measures of V(c,max) and J(max) in ~5 min, and possibly 
      even faster. This is a small fraction of the time required for even the most 
      advanced gas exchange instrumentation. The RACiR technique, owing to its 
      increased throughput, will allow for more rapid screening of crops, mutants and 
      populations of plants in natural environments, bringing gas exchange into the 
      phenomic era.

      2-8-year-olds with autism spectrum disorder.
PG  - 121-132
LID - 10.1002/aur.1884 [doi]
AB  - We examined phenotypes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on trajectories of 
      intellectual development from early (ages 2-3 ½) to middle (ages 5-8) childhood 
      in a recent clinically ascertained cohort. Participants included 102 children (82 
      males) initially diagnosed with ASD from the Autism Phenome Project longitudinal 
      sample. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify distinct IQ 
      trajectories. Baseline and developmental course differences among groups were 
      assessed using univariate techniques and repeated measures regression models, 
      respectively. A four class model best represented the data. Using the highest 
      posterior probability, participants were assigned to High Challenges (25.5%), 
      Stable Low (17.6%), Changers (35.3%), and Lesser Challenges (21.6%) groups. The 
      High Challenges and Stable Low groups exhibited persistently low IQ, although, 
      the High Challenges group experienced declines while the Stable Low group's 
      scores remained more constant. Changers showed IQ improvement of > 2 standard 
      deviations. The Lesser Challenges group had IQs in the average range at both 
      times that were about 1 standard deviation higher at T2. In summation, 75% of the 
      participants experienced some relative improvements in intellectual and/or other 
      areas of functioning between ages 2 and 8 years. The Changers group demonstrated 
      the most significant IQ change that was accompanied by adaptive communication 
      improvement and declining externalizing symptoms. Only the Lesser Challenges 
      group showed a significant reduction in ASD symptom severity, such that by age 8, 
      14% of them no longer met ADOS-2 criteria for ASD. All groups showed reductions 
      in internalizing symptoms. Intervention history was not associated with group 
      status. Autism Res 2018, 11: 121-132. © 2017 International Society for Autism 
      Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: We examined how the IQs of 
      children with autism spectrum disorder change between ages 2 and 8, and 
      identified four patterns. Two groups exhibited persistently lower IQs. One group 
      showed IQ increases of greater than 30 points with improved communicate abilities 
      and declining disruptive behaviors. The final group had IQs in the average or 
      better range at both time points, and 14% of them lost their diagnoses. Over half 
      of the children experienced improved intellectual functioning between ages 2 and 
      8, whereas about 25% showed declines. Findings were not associated with 
      intervention history.

TI  - The use of electronic health records for psychiatric phenotyping and genomics.
PG  - 601-612
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32548 [doi]
AB  - The widespread adoption of electronic health record (EHRs) in healthcare systems 
      has created a vast and continuously growing resource of clinical data and 
      provides new opportunities for population-based research. In particular, the 
      linking of EHRs to biospecimens and genomic data in biobanks may help address 
      what has become a rate-limiting study for genetic research: the need for large 
      sample sizes. The principal roadblock to capitalizing on these resources is the 
      need to establish the validity of phenotypes extracted from the EHR. For 
      psychiatric genetic research, this represents a particular challenge given that 
      diagnosis is based on patient reports and clinician observations that may not be 
      well-captured in billing codes or narrative records. This review addresses the 
      opportunities and pitfalls in EHR-based phenotyping with a focus on their 
      application to psychiatric genetic research. A growing number of studies have 
      demonstrated that diagnostic algorithms with high positive predictive value can 
      be derived from EHRs, especially when structured data are supplemented by text 
      mining approaches. Such algorithms enable semi-automated phenotyping for 
      large-scale case-control studies. In addition, the scale and scope of EHR 
      databases have been used successfully to identify phenotypic subgroups and derive 
      algorithms for longitudinal risk prediction. EHR-based genomics are particularly 
      well-suited to rapid look-up replication of putative risk genes, studies of 
      pleiotropy (phenomewide association studies or PheWAS), investigations of genetic 
      networks and overlap across the phenome, and pharmacogenomic research. EHR 
      phenotyping has been relatively under-utilized in psychiatric genomic research 
      but may become a key component of efforts to advance precision psychiatry.

TI  - Structure and stability of genetic variance-covariance matrices: A Bayesian 
      sparse factor analysis of transcriptional variation in the three-spined 
      stickleback.
PG  - 5099-5113
LID - 10.1111/mec.14265 [doi]
AB  - The genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) is a quantity of central importance in 
      evolutionary biology due to its influence on the rate and direction of 
      multivariate evolution. However, the predictive power of empirically estimated 
      G-matrices is limited for two reasons. First, phenotypes are high-dimensional, 
      whereas traditional statistical methods are tuned to estimate and analyse 
      low-dimensional matrices. Second, the stability of G to environmental effects and 
      over time remains poorly understood. Using Bayesian sparse factor analysis (BSFG) 
      designed to estimate high-dimensional G-matrices, we analysed levels variation 
      and covariation in 10,527 expressed genes in a large (n = 563) half-sib breeding 
      design of three-spined sticklebacks subject to two temperature treatments. We 
      found significant differences in the structure of G between the treatments: 
      heritabilities and evolvabilities were higher in the warm than in the 
      low-temperature treatment, suggesting more and faster opportunity to evolve in 
      warm (stressful) conditions. Furthermore, comparison of G and its phenotypic 
      equivalent P revealed the latter is a poor substitute of the former. Most 
      strikingly, the results suggest that the expected impact of G on evolvability-as 
      well as the similarity among G-matrices-may depend strongly on the number of 
      traits included into analyses. In our results, the inclusion of only few traits 
      in the analyses leads to underestimation in the differences between the 
      G-matrices and their predicted impacts on evolution. While the results highlight 
      the challenges involved in estimating G, they also illustrate that by enabling 
      the estimation of large G-matrices, the BSFG method can improve predicted 
      evolutionary responses to selection.

TI  - Phenomic Approaches and Tools for Phytopathologists.
PG  - 6-17
AB  - Plant phenomics approaches aim to measure traits such as growth, performance, and 
      composition of plants using a suite of noninvasive technologies. The goal is to 
      link phenotypic traits to the genetic information for particular genotypes, thus 
      creating the bridge between the phenome and genome. Application of sensing 
      technologies for detecting specific phenotypic reactions occurring during 
      plant-pathogen interaction offers new opportunities for elucidating the 
      physiological mechanisms that link pathogen infection and disease symptoms in the 
      host, and also provides a faster approach in the selection of genetic material 
      that is resistant to specific pathogens or strains. Appropriate phenomics methods 
      and tools may also allow presymptomatic detection of disease-related changes in 
      plants or to identify changes that are not visually apparent. This review focuses 
      on the use of sensor-based phenomics tools in plant pathology such as those 
      related to digital imaging, chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, spectral imaging, 
      and thermal imaging. A brief introduction is provided for less used approaches 
      like magnetic resonance, soft x-ray imaging, ultrasound, and detection of 
      volatile compounds. We hope that this concise review will stimulate further 
      development and use of tools for automatic, nondestructive, and high-throughput 
      phenotyping of plant-pathogen interaction.

TI  - Functional characterization of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in the cereal head 
      blight fungus Fusarium graminearum.
PG  - 2053-2067
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.13730 [doi]
AB  - Fusarium graminearum is a prominent plant pathogenic fungus causing Fusarium head 
      blight in major cereal crops worldwide. To understand the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying fungal development and virulence, large collections of F. graminearum 
      mutants have been constructed. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are widely 
      distributed in organisms and are involved in a diverse array of 
      molecular/metabolic processes; however, no systematic functional analysis of 
      P450s has been attempted in filamentous fungi. In this study, we constructed a 
      genome-wide deletion mutant set covering 102 P450s and analyzed these mutants for 
      changes in 38 phenotypic categories, including fungal development, stress 
      responses and responses to several xenobiotics, to build a comprehensive 
      phenotypic dataset. Most P450 mutants showing defective phenotypes were impaired 
      in a single phenotypic trait, demonstrating that our mutant library is a good 
      genetic resource for further fungal genetic studies. In particular, we identified 
      novel P450s specifically involved in virulence (5) and both asexual (1) and 
      sexual development (2). Most P450s seem to play redundant roles in the 
      degradation of xenobiotics in F. graminearum. This study is the first 
      phenome-based functional analysis of P450s, and it provides a valuable genetic 
      resource for further basic and applied biological research in filamentous fungi 
      and other plant pathogens.

AB  - Here, we report the successful design, construction, and characterization of a 
      770-kilobase synthetic yeast chromosome II (synII). Our study incorporates 
      characterization at multiple levels-including phenomics, transcriptomics, 
      proteomics, chromosome segregation, and replication analysis-to provide a 
      thorough and comprehensive analysis of a synthetic chromosome. Our Trans-Omics 
      analyses reveal a modest but potentially relevant pervasive up-regulation of 
      translational machinery observed in synII, mainly caused by the deletion of 13 
      transfer RNAs. By both complementation assays and SCRaMbLE (synthetic chromosome 
      rearrangement and modification by loxP-mediated evolution), we targeted and 
      debugged the origin of a growth defect at 37°C in glycerol medium, which is 
      related to misregulation of the high-osmolarity glycerol response. Despite the 
      subtle differences, the synII strain shows highly consistent biological processes 
      comparable to the native strain.

TI  - PREDICTIVE MODELING OF HOSPITAL READMISSION RATES USING ELECTRONIC MEDICAL 
      RECORD-WIDE MACHINE LEARNING: A CASE-STUDY USING MOUNT SINAI HEART FAILURE 
      COHORT.
PG  - 276-287
LID - 10.1142/9789813207813_0027 [doi]
AB  - Reduction of preventable hospital readmissions that result from chronic or acute 
      conditions like stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction and pneumonia 
      remains a significant challenge for improving the outcomes and decreasing the 
      cost of healthcare delivery in the United States. Patient readmission rates are 
      relatively high for conditions like heart failure (HF) despite the implementation 
      of high-quality healthcare delivery operation guidelines created by regulatory 
      authorities. Multiple predictive models are currently available to evaluate 
      potential 30-day readmission rates of patients. Most of these models are 
      hypothesis driven and repetitively assess the predictive abilities of the same 
      set of biomarkers as predictive features. In this manuscript, we discuss our 
      attempt to develop a data-driven, electronic-medical record-wide (EMR-wide) 
      feature selection approach and subsequent machine learning to predict readmission 
      probabilities. We have assessed a large repertoire of variables from electronic 
      medical records of heart failure patients in a single center. The cohort included 
      1,068 patients with 178 patients were readmitted within a 30-day interval (16.66% 
      readmission rate). A total of 4,205 variables were extracted from EMR including 
      diagnosis codes (n=1,763), medications (n=1,028), laboratory measurements 
      (n=846), surgical procedures (n=564) and vital signs (n=4). We designed a 
      multistep modeling strategy using the Naïve Bayes algorithm. In the first step, 
      we created individual models to classify the cases (readmitted) and controls 
      (non-readmitted). In the second step, features contributing to predictive risk 
      from independent models were combined into a composite model using a 
      correlation-based feature selection (CFS) method. All models were trained and 
      tested using a 5-fold cross-validation method, with 70% of the cohort used for 
      training and the remaining 30% for testing. Compared to existing predictive 
      models for HF readmission rates (AUCs in the range of 0.6-0.7), results from our 
      EMR-wide predictive model (AUC=0.78; Accuracy=83.19%) and phenome-wide feature 
      selection strategies are encouraging and reveal the utility of such datadriven 
      machine learning. Fine tuning of the model, replication using multi-center 
      cohorts and prospective clinical trial to evaluate the clinical utility would 
      help the adoption of the model as a clinical decision system for evaluating 
      readmission status.

AB  - Colorectal carcinoma represents a heterogeneous entity, with only a fraction of 
      the tumours responding to available therapies, requiring a better molecular 
      understanding of the disease in precision oncology. To address this challenge, 
      the OncoTrack consortium recruited 106 CRC patients (stages I-IV) and developed a 
      pre-clinical platform generating a compendium of drug sensitivity data totalling 
      >4,000 assays testing 16 clinical drugs on patient-derived in vivo and in vitro 
      models. This large biobank of 106 tumours, 35 organoids and 59 xenografts, with 
      extensive omics data comparing donor tumours and derived models provides a 
      resource for advancing our understanding of CRC. Models recapitulate many of the 
      genetic and transcriptomic features of the donors, but defined less complex 
      molecular sub-groups because of the loss of human stroma. Linking molecular 
      profiles with drug sensitivity patterns identifies novel biomarkers, including a 
      signature outperforming RAS/RAF mutations in predicting sensitivity to the EGFR 
      inhibitor cetuximab.

AB  - Plant genetic resources are a substantial opportunity for plant breeding, 
      preservation and maintenance of biological diversity. As part of the German 
      Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI) the German Crop 
      BioGreenformatics Network (GCBN) focuses mainly on crop plants and provides both 
      data and software infrastructure which are tailored to the needs of the plant 
      research community. Our mission and key objectives include: (1) provision of 
      transparent access to germplasm seeds, (2) the delivery of improved workflows for 
      plant gene annotation, and (3) implementation of bioinformatics services that 
      link genotypes and phenotypes. This review introduces the GCBN's spectrum of 
      web-services and integrated data resources that address common research problems 
      in the plant genomics community.

AB  - Sculpins are predominantly benthic sit-and-wait predators that inhabit marine and 
      freshwaters of the Northern Hemisphere. In striking contrast to riverine 
      relatives, sculpins endemic to Lake Baikal have diversified in both form and 
      function, with multiple taxa having adaptations for pelagic and bathyal niches 
      within the world's deepest lake. Baikal Oilfishes (Comephorus spp.) represent a 
      highly apomorphic taxon with unique skeletal morphology, soft anatomy, and 
      reproductive ecology. Selection for novel behavior and life history may be 
      evident in genes responsible for organismal energy balance, including those 
      encoding subunits of the electron transport chain. Complete mitochondrial genomes 
      were sequenced for the Big Baikal Oilfish (Comephorus baicalensis) and Little 
      Baikal Oilfish (Comephorus dybowskii). Mitochondrial genomes encode genes 
      essential for electron transport, and data provided here will complement ongoing 
      investigations of genome-to-phenome maps for teleost respiration and metabolism. 
      Phylogenetic analyses including oilfish mitogenomes and all publicly available 
      cottoid representative sequences are largely concordant with previous studies.

TI  - Transition from a maternal to external nitrogen source in maize seedlings.
PG  - 261-274
LID - 10.1111/jipb.12525 [doi]
AB  - Maximizing NO(3)(-) uptake during seedling development is important as it has a 
      major influence on plant growth and yield. However, little is known about the 
      processes leading to, and involved in, the initiation of root NO(3)(-) uptake 
      capacity in developing seedlings. This study examines the physiological processes 
      involved in root NO(3)(-) uptake and metabolism, to gain an understanding of how 
      the NO(3)(-) uptake system responds to meet demand as maize seedlings transition 
      from seed N use to external N capture. The concentrations of seed-derived free 
      amino acids within root and shoot tissues are initially high, but decrease 
      rapidly until stabilizing eight days after imbibition (DAI). Similarly, shoot N% 
      decreases, but does not stabilize until 12-13 DAI. Following the decrease in free 
      amino acid concentrations, root NO(3)(-) uptake capacity increases until shoot N% 
      stabilizes. The increase in root NO(3)(-) uptake capacity corresponds with a 
      rapid rise in transcript levels of putative NO(3)(-) transporters, ZmNRT2.1 and 
      ZmNRT2.2. The processes underlying the increase in root NO(3)(-) uptake capacity 
      to meet N demand provide an insight into the processes controlling N uptake.

AB  - In experimental physiological research, a common study design for examining the 
      functional role of a gene or a genetic variant is to introduce that genetic 
      variant into a model organism (such as yeast or mouse) and then to search for 
      phenotypic consequences. The development of DNA biobanks linked to dense 
      phenotypic information enables such an experiment to be applied to human subjects 
      in the form of a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). The PheWAS paradigm 
      takes advantage of a curated medical phenome, often derived from electronic 
      health records, to search for associations between 'input functions' and 
      phenotypes in an unbiased fashion. The most commonly studied input function to 
      date has been single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but other inputs, such as 
      sets of SNPs or a disease or drug exposure, are now being explored to probe the 
      genetic and phenotypic architecture of human traits. Potential outcomes of these 
      approaches include defining subsets of complex diseases (that can then be 
      targeted by specific therapies) and drug repurposing.

TI  - Defining the complex phenotype of severe systemic loxoscelism using a large

PG  - e0174941

LID - e0174941
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Systemic loxoscelism is a rare illness resulting from the bite of the 
      recluse spider and, in its most severe form, can lead to widespread hemolysis, 
      coagulopathy, and death. We aim to describe the clinical features and outcomes of 
      the largest known cohort of individuals with moderate to severe loxoscelism. 
      METHODS: We performed a retrospective, cross sectional study from January 1, 
      1995, to December 31, 2015, at a tertiary-care academic medical center, to 
      determine individuals with clinical records consistent with moderate to severe 
      loxoscelism. Age-, sex-, and race-matched controls were compared. Demographics, 
      clinical characteristics, laboratory measures, and outcomes of individuals with 
      loxoscelism are described. Case and control groups were compared with descriptive 
      statistics and phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). RESULTS: During the time 
      period, 57 individuals were identified as having moderate to severe loxoscelism. 
      Of these, only 33% had an antecedent spider bite documented. Median age of 
      individuals diagnosed with moderate to severe loxoscelism was 14 years old (IQR 
      9.0-24.0 years). PheWAS confirmed associations of systemic loxoscelism with 29 
      other phenotypes, e.g., rash, hemolytic anemia, and sepsis. Hemoglobin level 
      dropped an average of 3.1 g/dL over an average of 2.0 days (IQR 2.0-6.0). Lactate 
      dehydrogenase and total bilirubin levels were on average over two times their 
      upper limit of normal values. Eighteen individuals of 32 tested had a positive 
      direct antiglobulin (Coombs') test. Mortality was 3.5% (2/57 individuals). 
      CONCLUSION: Systemic loxoscelism is a rare but devastating process with only a 
      minority of patients recalling the toxic exposure; hemolysis reaches a peak at 2 
      days after admission, with some cases taking more than a week before recovery. In 
      endemic areas, suspicion for systemic loxoscelism should be high in individuals, 
      especially children and younger adults, presenting with a cutaneous ulcer and 
      hemolysis or coagulopathy, even in the absence of a bite exposure history.

TI  - Hair Cortisol in Twins: Heritability and Genetic Overlap with Psychological 
      Variables and Stress-System Genes.
PG  - 15351

AB  - Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is a promising measure of long-term 
      hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Previous research has 
      suggested an association between HCC and psychological variables, and initial 
      studies of inter-individual variance in HCC have implicated genetic factors. 
      However, whether HCC and psychological variables share genetic risk factors 
      remains unclear. The aims of the present twin study were to: (i) assess the 
      heritability of HCC; (ii) estimate the phenotypic and genetic correlation between 
      HPA axis activity and the psychological variables perceived stress, depressive 
      symptoms, and neuroticism; using formal genetic twin models and molecular genetic 
      methods, i.e. polygenic risk scores (PRS). HCC was measured in 671 adolescents 
      and young adults. These included 115 monozygotic and 183 dizygotic twin-pairs. 
      For 432 subjects PRS scores for plasma cortisol, major depression, and 
      neuroticism were calculated using data from large genome wide association 
      studies. The twin model revealed a heritability for HCC of 72%. No significant 
      phenotypic or genetic correlation was found between HCC and the three 
      psychological variables of interest. PRS did not explain variance in HCC. The 
      present data suggest that HCC is highly heritable. However, the data do not 
      support a strong biological link between HCC and any of the investigated 
      psychological variables.

TI  - Non-Canonical Hedgehog Signaling Is a Positive Regulator of the WNT Pathway and 
      Is Required for the Survival of Colon Cancer Stem Cells.

AB  - Colon cancer is a heterogeneous tumor driven by a subpopulation of cancer stem 
      cells (CSCs). To study CSCs in colon cancer, we used limiting dilution spheroid 
      and serial xenotransplantation assays to functionally define the frequency of 
      CSCs in a panel of patient-derived cancer organoids. These studies demonstrated 
      cancer organoids to be enriched for CSCs, which varied in frequency between 
      tumors. Whole-transcriptome analysis identified WNT and Hedgehog signaling 
      components to be enhanced in CSC-enriched tumors and in aldehyde dehydrogenase 
      (ALDH)-positive CSCs. Canonical GLI-dependent Hedgehog signaling is a negative 
      regulator of WNT signaling in normal intestine and intestinal tumors. Here, we 
      show that Hedgehog signaling in colon CSCs is autocrine SHH-dependent, 
      non-canonical PTCH1 dependent, and GLI independent. In addition, using 
      small-molecule inhibitors and RNAi against SHH-palmitoylating Hedgehog 
      acyltransferase (HHAT), we demonstrate that non-canonical Hedgehog signaling is a 
      positive regulator of WNT signaling and required for colon CSC survival.

TI  - The role of the cancer stem cell marker CD271 in DNA damage response and drug 
      resistance of melanoma cells.
PG  - e291
LID - 10.1038/oncsis.2016.88 [doi]
AB  - Several lines of evidence have suggested that stemness and acquired resistance to 
      targeted inhibitors or chemotherapeutics are mechanistically linked. Here we 
      observed high cell surface and total levels of nerve growth factor 
      receptor/CD271, a marker of melanoma-initiating cells, in sub-populations of 
      chemoresistant cell lines. CD271 expression was increased in drug-sensitive cells 
      but not resistant cells in response to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics etoposide, 
      fotemustine and cisplatin. Comparative analysis of melanoma cells engineered to 
      stably express CD271 or a targeting short hairpin RNA by expression profiling 
      provided numerous genes regulated in a CD271-dependent manner. In-depth analysis 
      of CD271-responsive genes uncovered the association of CD271 with regulation of 
      DNA repair components. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis revealed 
      enrichment of CD271-responsive genes in drug-resistant cells, among them DNA 
      repair components. Moreover, our comparative screen identified the fibroblast 
      growth factor 13 (FGF13) as a target of CD271, highly expressed in chemoresistant 
      cells. Further we show that levels of CD271 determine drug response. Knock-down 
      of CD271 in fotemustine-resistant cells decreased expression of FGF13 and at 
      least partly restored sensitivity to fotemustine. Together, we demonstrate that 
      expression of CD271 is responsible for genes associated with DNA repair and drug 
      response. Further, we identified 110 CD271-responsive genes predominantly 
      expressed in melanoma metastases, among them were NEK2, TOP2A and RAD51AP1 as 
      potential drivers of melanoma metastasis. In addition, we provide mechanistic 
      insight in the regulation of CD271 in response to drugs. We found that CD271 is 
      potentially regulated by p53 and in turn is needed for a proper p53-dependent 
      response to DNA-damaging drugs. In summary, we provide for the first time insight 
      in a CD271-associated signaling network connecting CD271 with DNA repair, drug 
      response and metastasis.

TI  - Exploring the in vivo digestion of plant proteins in broiler chickens.
PG  - 1735-1747
LID - 10.3382/ps/pew444 [doi]
AB  - The use of various protein sources (industry by-products, proteaginous) in 
      poultry diets requires a greater understanding of protein digestion mechanisms. 
      The aim of this study was to characterize the molecular actors required for 
      protein digestion in broilers fed 4 different diets containing soybean meal, 
      rapeseed meal, pea, or corn distiller's dried grain with solubles as the only 
      protein source. The digesta of the digestive tract segments were collected and 
      soluble proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE analyses revealed 5 
      ubiquitous bands in digesta of all digestive tract segments regardless of the 
      diet, whereas 3 bands were diet-specific. The digesta of the jejunum were further 
      submitted to proteomic analysis. Forty-two proteins of chicken origin and 17 
      plant proteins were identified in digesta samples by mass spectrometry. Fifteen 
      proteins of chicken origin were specific to one diet and 18 were common to all 
      diets. By homology with mammals, these proteins are thought to be involved in 
      protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and nucleic acid metabolism and also in intestinal 
      homeostasis. Some of the 17 plant proteins were found to be not fully digested 
      (soybean meal, rapeseed meal, and pea diets) and others were identified as 
      protease inhibitors (soybean meal and pea diets). This study provides a 
      comprehensive analysis of the physiological proteins involved in the digestion of 
      4 protein sources used in broiler diets. Such an approach, combined with the 
      analysis of insoluble components of these different protein sources, would 
      contribute to define whether these protein sources could be more largely used in 
      poultry nutrition. It also would allow identifying ways to improve their 
      digestibility in broiler chickens (feed additives such as exogenous proteases or 
      processing to inactivate anti-nutritional factors, for instance).

TI  - Targeting a Proteinase-Activated Receptor 4 (PAR4) Carboxyl Terminal Motif to 
      Regulate Platelet Function.
PG  - 287-295
LID - 10.1124/mol.116.106526 [doi]
AB  - Thrombin initiates human platelet aggregation by coordinately activating 
      proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) 1 and 4. However, targeting PAR1 with an 
      orthosteric-tethered ligand binding-site antagonist results in bleeding, possibly 
      owing to the important role of PAR1 activation on cells other than platelets. 
      Because of its more restricted tissue expression profile, we have therefore 
      turned to PAR4 as an antiplatelet target. We have identified an intracellular 
      PAR4 C-terminal motif that regulates calcium signaling and β-arrestin 
      interactions. By disrupting this PAR4 calcium/β-arrestin signaling process with a 
      novel cell-penetrating peptide, we were able to inhibit both thrombin-triggered 
      platelet aggregation in vitro and clot consolidation in vivo. We suggest that 
      targeting PAR4 represents an attractive alternative to blocking PAR1 for 
      antiplatelet therapy in humans.

AB  - The need for rapid and efficient high throughput metabolic phenotyping 
      (metabotyping) in metabolomic/metabonomic studies often requires compromises to 
      be made between analytical speed and metabolome coverage. Here the effect of 
      column length (150, 75 and 30 mm) and gradient duration (15, 7.5 and 3 min 
      respectively) on the number of features detected when untargeted metabolic 
      profiling of human urine using reversed-phase gradient ultra performance 
      chromatography with, and without, ion mobility spectrometry, has been examined. 
      As would be expected, reducing column length from 150 to 30 mm, and gradient 
      duration, from 15 to 3 min, resulted in a reduction in peak capacity from 311 to 
      63 and a similar reduction in the number of features detected from over ca. 
      16,000 to ca. 6500. Under the same chromatographic conditions employing 
      UPLC/IMS/MS to provide an additional orthogonal separation resulted in an 
      increase in the number of MS features detected to nearly 20,000 and ca. 7500 for 
      the 150 mm and the 30 mm columns respectively. Based on this limited study the 
      potential of LC/IMS/MS as a tool for improving throughput and increasing 
      metabolome coverage clearly merits further in depth study.

TI  - Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice 
      Diversity Survey.
PG  - 248-258
LID - 10.1104/pp.17.00332 [doi]
AB  - Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve 
      crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic 
      parameters positively related to crop biomass accumulation through this approach 
      are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf 
      instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice 
      (Oryza sativa) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that 
      are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy 
      photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic 
      parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 
      204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally 
      and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key 
      components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a 
      stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although 
      there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters measured in different 
      environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A(low)) was 
      highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic 
      inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as 
      a target for future rice breeding programs. Large variations in A(low) among 
      modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter 
      in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield 
      potential.

TI  - Detecting spikes of wheat plants using neural networks with Laws texture energy.
PG  - 83
LID - 10.1186/s13007-017-0231-1 [doi]
LID - 83
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spike of a cereal plant is the grain-bearing organ whose physical 
      characteristics are proxy measures of grain yield. The ability to detect and 
      characterise spikes from 2D images of cereal plants, such as wheat, therefore 
      provides vital information on tiller number and yield potential. RESULTS: We have 
      developed a novel spike detection method for wheat plants involving, firstly, an 
      improved colour index method for plant segmentation and, secondly, a neural 
      network-based method using Laws texture energy for spike detection. The spike 
      detection step was further improved by removing noise using an area and height 
      threshold. The evaluation results showed an accuracy of over 80% in 
      identification of spikes. In the proposed method we also measure the area of 
      individual spikes as well as all spikes of individual plants under different 
      experimental conditions. The correlation between the final average grain yield 
      and spike area is also discussed in this paper. CONCLUSIONS: Our highly accurate 
      yield trait phenotyping method for spike number counting and spike area 
      estimation, is useful and reliable not only for grain yield estimation but also 
      for detecting and quantifying subtle phenotypic variations arising from genetic 
      or environmental differences.

LID - 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.06.040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Substance use disorder (SUD) remains a significant public health 
      issue. A greater understanding of how genes and environment interact to regulate 
      phenotypes comprising SUD will facilitate directed treatments and prevention. 
      METHODS: The literature studying the neurobiological correlates of SUD with a 
      focus on the genetic and environmental influences underlying these mechanisms was 
      reviewed. Results from twin/family, human genetic association, gene-environment 
      interaction, epigenetic literature, phenome-wide association studies are 
      summarized for alcohol, nicotine, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opioids. RESULTS: 
      There are substantial genetic influences on SUD that are expected to influence 
      multiple neurotransmission pathways, and these influences are particularly 
      important within the dopaminergic system. Genetic influences involved in other 
      aspects of SUD etiology including drug processing and metabolism are also 
      identified. Studies of gene-environment interaction emphasize the importance of 
      environmental context in SUD. Epigenetic studies indicate drug-specific changes 
      in gene expression as well as differences in gene expression related to the use 
      of multiple substances. Further, gene expression is expected to differ by stage 
      of SUD such as substance initiation versus chronic substance use. While a 
      substantial literature has developed for alcohol and nicotine use disorders, 
      there is comparatively less information for other commonly abused substances. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of genetically-mediated mechanisms involved 
      in the neurobiology of SUD provides increased opportunity to develop behavioral 
      and biologically based treatment and prevention of SUD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic differences in the target proteins, metabolizing enzymes and 
      transporters that contribute to inter-individual differences in drug response are 
      not integrated in contemporary drug development programs. Ayurveda, that has 
      propelled many drug discovery programs albeit for the search of new chemical 
      entities incorporates inter-individual variability "Prakriti" in development and 
      administration of drug in an individualized manner. Prakriti of an individual 
      largely determines responsiveness to external environment including drugs as well 
      as susceptibility to diseases. Prakriti has also been shown to have molecular and 
      genomic correlates. We highlight how integration of Prakriti concepts can augment 
      the efficiency of drug discovery and development programs through a unique 
      initiative of Ayurgenomics TRISUTRA consortium. METHODS: Five aspects that have 
      been carried out are (1) analysis of variability in FDA approved pharmacogenomics 
      genes/SNPs in exomes of 72 healthy individuals including predominant Prakriti 
      types and matched controls from a North Indian Indo-European cohort (2) 
      establishment of a consortium network and development of five genetically 
      homogeneous cohorts from diverse ethnic and geo-climatic background (3) 
      identification of parameters and development of uniform standard protocols for 
      objective assessment of Prakriti types (4) development of protocols for Prakriti 
      evaluation and its application in more than 7500 individuals in the five cohorts 
      (5) Development of data and sample repository and integrative omics pipelines for 
      identification of genomic correlates. RESULTS: Highlight of the study are (1) 
      Exome sequencing revealed significant differences between Prakriti types in 28 
      SNPs of 11 FDA approved genes of pharmacogenomics relevance viz. CYP2C19, CYP2B6, 
      ESR1, F2, PGR, HLA-B, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB1, LDLR, CFTR, CPS1. These variations are 
      polymorphic in diverse Indian and world populations included in 1000 genomes 
      project. (2) Based on the phenotypic attributes of Prakriti we identified 
      anthropometry for anatomical features, biophysical parameters for skin types, HRV 
      for autonomic function tests, spirometry for vital capacity and gustometry for 
      taste thresholds as objective parameters. (3) Comparison of Prakriti phenotypes 
      across different ethnic, age and gender groups led to identification of invariant 
      features as well as some that require weighted considerations across the cohorts. 
      CONCLUSION: Considering the molecular and genomics differences underlying 
      Prakriti and relevance in disease pharmacogenomics studies, this novel 
      integrative platform would help in identification of differently susceptible and 
      drug responsive population. Additionally, integrated analysis of phenomic and 
      genomic variations would not only allow identification of clinical and genomic 
      markers of Prakriti for application in personalized medicine but also its 
      integration in drug discovery and development programs.

TI  - Phenomics allows identification of genomic regions affecting maize stomatal 
      conductance with conditional effects of water deficit and evaporative demand.
PG  - 314-326
LID - 10.1111/pce.13083 [doi]
AB  - Stomatal conductance is central for the trades-off between hydraulics and 
      photosynthesis. We aimed at deciphering its genetic control and that of its 
      responses to evaporative demand and water deficit, a nearly impossible task with 
      gas exchanges measurements. Whole-plant stomatal conductance was estimated via 
      inversion of the Penman-Monteith equation from data of transpiration and plant 
      architecture collected in a phenotyping platform. We have analysed jointly 4 
      experiments with contrasting environmental conditions imposed to a panel of 254 
      maize hybrids. Estimated whole-plant stomatal conductance closely correlated with 
      gas-exchange measurements and biomass accumulation rate. Sixteen robust 
      quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified by genome wide association studies 
      and co-located with QTLs of transpiration and biomass. Light, vapour pressure 
      deficit, or soil water potential largely accounted for the differences in allelic 
      effects between experiments, thereby providing strong hypotheses for mechanisms 
      of stomatal control and a way to select relevant candidate genes among the 1-19 
      genes harboured by QTLs. The combination of allelic effects, as affected by 
      environmental conditions, accounted for the variability of stomatal conductance 
      across a range of hybrids and environmental conditions. This approach may 
      therefore contribute to genetic analysis and prediction of stomatal control in 
      diverse environments.

TI  - Integrated Analytical and Statistical Two-Dimensional Spectroscopy Strategy for 
      Metabolite Identification: Application to Dietary Biomarkers.
PG  - 3300-3309
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03324 [doi]
AB  - A major purpose of exploratory metabolic profiling is for the identification of 
      molecular species that are statistically associated with specific biological or 
      medical outcomes; unfortunately, the structure elucidation process of unknowns is 
      often a major bottleneck in this process. We present here new holistic strategies 
      that combine different statistical spectroscopic and analytical techniques to 
      improve and simplify the process of metabolite identification. We exemplify these 
      strategies using study data collected as part of a dietary intervention to 
      improve health and which elicits a relatively subtle suite of changes from 
      complex molecular profiles. We identify three new dietary biomarkers related to 
      the consumption of peas (N-methyl nicotinic acid), apples (rhamnitol), and onions 
      (N-acetyl-S-(1Z)-propenyl-cysteine-sulfoxide) that can be used to enhance dietary 
      assessment and assess adherence to diet. As part of the strategy, we introduce a 
      new probabilistic statistical spectroscopy tool, RED-STORM (Resolution EnhanceD 
      SubseT Optimization by Reference Matching), that uses 2D J-resolved (1)H NMR 
      spectra for enhanced information recovery using the Bayesian paradigm to extract 
      a subset of spectra with similar spectral signatures to a reference. RED-STORM 
      provided new information for subsequent experiments (e.g., 2D-NMR spectroscopy, 
      solid-phase extraction, liquid chromatography prefaced mass spectrometry) used to 
      ultimately identify an unknown compound. In summary, we illustrate the benefit of 
      acquiring J-resolved experiments alongside conventional 1D (1)H NMR as part of 
      routine metabolic profiling in large data sets and show that application of 
      complementary statistical and analytical techniques for the identification of 
      unknown metabolites can be used to save valuable time and resources.

LID - 1034
AB  - To identify novel phenotypic associations related to Cytochrome P450 Family 2 
      Subfamily A Member 6 (CYP2A6), we investigated the human phenome in a total of 
      11,271 individuals. Initially, we conducted a phenome-wide association study in 
      3,401 nicotine-exposed elderly subjects considering 358 phenotypic traits. We 
      identified a significant association between CYP2A6 rs113288603 and hearing loss 
      symptoms (p = 5.75 × 10(-5)). No association was observed in a sample of 3,245 
      nicotine-unexposed individuals from the same discovery cohort, consistent with 
      the conclusion that the finding is related to CYP2A6 involvement in nicotine 
      metabolism. Consistent results were obtained (p < 0.1) in an independent sample 
      of 2,077 nicotine-exposed elderly subjects, and similarly, no significance was 
      observed in the nicotine-unexposed sample (n = 2,548) of the replication cohort. 
      Additional supporting evidence for this association was provided by gene 
      expression data: rs113288603 is associated with increased CYP2A6 expression in 
      cerebellar hemispheres (p = 7.8 × 10(-4)). There is a well-known correlation 
      between smoking and age-related hearing loss. Cigarette smoking is associated 
      with structural changes in the brain and CYP2A6 mediates these changes. In this 
      context, the regulatory role of rs113288603 in cerebellum appears to be 
      consistent with the known involvement of this brain region in auditory function.

TI  - ADH1B: From alcoholism, natural selection, and cancer to the human phenome.
PG  - 113-125
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32523 [doi]
AB  - The ADH1B (Alcohol Dehydrogenase 1B (class I), Beta Polypeptide) gene and its 
      best-known functional alleles, Arg48His (rs1229984, ADH1B*2) and Arg370Cys 
      (rs2066702, ADH1B*3), have been investigated in relation to many phenotypic 
      traits; most frequently including alcohol metabolism and alcohol drinking 
      behaviors, but also human evolution, liver function, cancer, and, recently, the 
      comprehensive human phenome. To understand ADH1B functions and consequences, we 
      provide here a bioinformatic analysis of its gene regulation and molecular 
      functions, literature review of studies focused on this gene, and a discussion 
      regarding future research perspectives. Certain ADH1B alleles have large effects 
      on alcohol metabolism, and this relationship particularly encourages further 
      investigations in relation to alcoholism and alcohol-associated cancer to 
      understand better the mechanisms by which alcohol metabolism contributes to 
      alcohol abuse and carcinogenesis. We also observed that ADH1B has complex 
      mechanisms that regulate its expression across multiple human tissues, and these 
      may be involved in cardiac and metabolic traits. Evolutionary data strongly 
      suggest that the selection signatures at the ADH1B locus are primarily related to 
      effects other than those on alcohol metabolism. This is also supported by the 
      involvement of ADH1B in multiple molecular pathways and by the findings of our 
      recent phenome-wide association study. Accordingly, future studies should also 
      investigate other functions of ADH1B potentially relevant for the human phenome.

AB  - On average less than half of the applied N is captured by crops, thus there is 
      scope and need to improve N uptake in cereals. With nitrate (NO(3)(-)) being the 
      main form of N available to cereal crops there has been a significant global 
      research effort to understand plant NO(3)(-) uptake. Despite this, our knowledge 
      of the NO(3)(-) uptake system is not sufficient to easily target ways to improve 
      NO(3)(-) uptake. Based on this there is an identified need to better understand 
      the NO(3)(-) uptake system and the signalling molecules that modulate it. With 
      strong transcriptional control governing the NO(3)(-) uptake system, we also need 
      new leads for modulating transcription of NO(3)(-) transporter genes.

TI  - Toward a Taxonomy for Multi-Omics Science? Terminology Development for Whole 
      Genome Study Approaches by Omics Technology and Hierarchy.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1089/omi.2016.0144 [doi]
AB  - Omics is a form of high-throughput systems science. However, taxonomies for omics 
      studies are limited, inviting us to rethink new ways in which we classify, 
      prioritize, and rank various omics systems science studies. In this overarching 
      context, the genome-wide study approaches have proliferated in number and 
      popularity over the past decade. However, their hierarchy is not well organized 
      and the development of attendant terminology is not controlled. In the present 
      study, we searched the literature in PubMed and the Web of Science databases 
      published from March 1999 to September 2016 using the keywords, including 
      genome-wide, association, whole genome, transcriptome-wide, metabolome, 
      epigenome, and phenome. We identified the whole genome study approaches and 
      sorted them according to the omics technology types (genomics, proteomics, and so 
      on) and hierarchy. Thirty-four studies from over 90 publications were sorted into 
      10 omics groups: DNA level, transcriptomics, proteomics, interactomics, 
      metabolomics, epigenomics, miRNomics/ncRNomics, phenomics, environmental omics, 
      and pharmacogenomics. We suggest here modifications of terminology for study 
      approaches, which share the same acronyms such as EWAS for epigenome-wide 
      association and environment-wide association studies, and MWAS for methylome-wide 
      association and metabolome-wide association studies. Taken together, our study 
      presented here provides the first systematic review and analyses of whole genome 
      approaches and presents a baseline for further controlled terminology 
      development, with a view to a new taxonomy for omics and multi-omics studies in 
      the future. Finally, we call for greater dialogue and collaboration across 
      diverse omics knowledge domains and applications, for example, across plants, 
      animals, clinical medicine, and ecology.

AB  - Phencyclidine (PCP) has been suggested to induce symptoms of schizophrenia. 
      However, animal models using PCP administration have produced ambiguous results 
      thus far. It seems that acute effects are similar to symptoms of schizophrenia, 
      however, it is not clear if PCP can induce permanent behavioral changes that 
      reflect schizophrenic-like symptoms. Therefore, we assessed the ability of 
      chronic PCP administration (3mg/kg, 14 days) to induce short or long lasting 
      behavioral changes in rats. Social behavior, including ultrasonic vocalizations 
      and motivation for social contact were investigated at different time points, up 
      to 29-36 days, after cessation of PCP treatment. During a social separation test, 
      performed at 5 and 36 days, PCP treated rats spent less time near the divider 
      that separates them from their familiar cage mate compared with saline (SAL) 
      treated rats. Further, at short term, PCP was able to induce a decrease in social 
      behavior. In contrast, at long-term, PCP treated animals spent more time in 
      contact when exposed to an unfamiliar partner as compared to SAL treated rats. 
      But, this difference was not observed when exposed to a familiar partner. We did 
      not find any difference in ultrasonic vocalizations at all time points. The 
      results of our study indicate that PCP is unable to induce overt long term 
      deficits in social interaction behavior. Rather, it seems that PCP diminishes 
      motivation for social contact. The long-term consequences of chronic PCP 
      administration on social behavior in rodent models remain complex, and future 
      studies addressing this are still needed.

TI  - Transfer learning across ontologies for phenome-genome association prediction.
PG  - 529-536
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btw649 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: To better predict and analyze gene associations with the collection 
      of phenotypes organized in a phenotype ontology, it is crucial to effectively 
      model the hierarchical structure among the phenotypes in the ontology and 
      leverage the sparse known associations with additional training information. In 
      this paper, we first introduce Dual Label Propagation (DLP) to impose consistent 
      associations with the entire phenotype paths in predicting phenotype-gene 
      associations in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). DLP is then used as the base 
      model in a transfer learning framework (tlDLP) to incorporate functional 
      annotations in Gene Ontology (GO). By simultaneously reconstructing GO term-gene 
      associations and HPO phenotype-gene associations for all the genes in a 
      protein-protein interaction network, tlDLP benefits from the enriched training 
      associations indirectly through relation with GO terms. RESULTS: In the 
      experiments to predict the associations between human genes and phenotypes in HPO 
      based on human protein-protein interaction network, both DLP and tlDLP improved 
      the prediction of gene associations with phenotype paths in HPO in 
      cross-validation and the prediction of the most recent associations added after 
      the snapshot of the training data. Moreover, the transfer learning through GO 
      term-gene associations significantly improved association predictions for the 
      phenotypes with no more specific known associations by a large margin. Examples 
      are also shown to demonstrate how phenotype paths in phenotype ontology and 
      transfer learning with gene ontology can improve the predictions. AVAILABILITY

AB  - Enhanced coverage and sensitivity of next-generation 'omic' platforms has allowed 
      the characterization of gene, metabolite and protein responses in highly 
      metabolic tissues, such as, skeletal muscle. A limitation, however, is the 
      capability to determine interaction between dynamic biological networks. To 
      address this limitation, we applied Weighted Analyte Correlation Network Analysis 
      (WACNA) to RNA-seq and metabolomic datasets to identify correlated subnetworks of 
      transcripts and metabolites in response to a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity 
      and/or exercise. HFD altered skeletal muscle lipid profiles and up-regulated 
      genes involved in lipid catabolism, while decreasing 241 exercise-responsive 
      genes related to skeletal muscle plasticity. WACNA identified the interplay 
      between transcript and metabolite subnetworks linked to lipid metabolism, 
      inflammation and glycerophospholipid metabolism that were associated with IL6, 
      AMPK and PPAR signal pathways. Collectively, this novel experimental approach 
      provides an integrative resource to study transcriptional and metabolic networks 
      in skeletal muscle in the context of health and disease.

AB  - The study of phenomes or phenomics has been a central part of biology. The field 
      of automatic phenotype acquisition technologies based on images has seen an 
      important advance in the last years. As with other high-throughput technologies, 
      it addresses a common set of problems, including data acquisition and analysis. 
      In this review, we give an overview of the main systems developed to acquire 
      images. We give an in-depth analysis of image processing with its major issues 
      and the algorithms that are being used or emerging as useful to obtain data out 
      of images in an automatic fashion.

AB  - Flowering time control integrates endogenous as well as environmental signals to 
      promote flower development. The pathways and molecular networks involved are 
      complex and integrate many modes of signal transduction. In plants ubiquitin 
      mediated protein degradation pathway has been proposed to be as important mode of 
      signaling as phosphorylation and transcription. To systematically study the role 
      of ubiquitin signaling in the molecular regulation of flowering we have taken a 
      genomic approach to identify flower related Ubiquitin Proteasome System 
      components. As a large and versatile gene family the RING type ubiquitin E3 
      ligases were chosen as targets of the genomic screen. The complete list of 
      Arabidopsis RING E3 ligases were retrieved and verified in the Arabidopsis genome 
      v11 and their differential expression was used for their categorization into 
      flower organs or developmental stages. Known regulators of flowering time or 
      floral organ development were identified in these categories through literature 
      search and representative mutants for each category were purchased for functional 
      characterization by growth and morphological phenotyping. To this end, a workflow 
      was developed for high throughput phenotypic screening of growth, morphology and 
      flowering of nearly a thousand Arabidopsis plants in one experimental round.

TI  - Polygenic risk has an impact on the structural plasticity of hippocampal 
      subfields during aerobic exercise combined with cognitive remediation in 
      multi-episode schizophrenia.
PG  - e1159
LID - 10.1038/tp.2017.131 [doi]
AB  - Preliminary studies suggest that, besides improving cognition, aerobic exercise 
      might increase hippocampal volume in schizophrenia patients; however, results are 
      not consistent. Individual mechanisms of volume changes are unknown but might be 
      connected to the load of risk genes. Genome-wide association studies have 
      uncovered the polygenic architecture of schizophrenia. The secondary analysis 
      presented here aimed to determine the modulatory role of schizophrenia polygenic 
      risk scores (PRSs) on volume changes in the total hippocampus and cornu ammonis 
      (CA) 1, CA2/3, CA4/dentate gyrus (DG) and subiculum over time. We studied 20 
      multi-episode schizophrenia patients and 23 healthy controls who performed 
      aerobic exercise (endurance training) combined with cognitive remediation for 3 
      months and 21 multi-episode schizophrenia patients allocated to a control 
      intervention (table soccer) combined with cognitive remediation. Magnetic 
      resonance imaging-based assessments were performed at baseline and after 3 months 
      with FreeSurfer. No effects of PRSs were found on total hippocampal volume 
      change. Subfield analyses showed that the volume changes between baseline and 3 
      months in the left CA4/DG were significantly influenced by PRSs in schizophrenia 
      patients performing aerobic exercise. A larger genetic risk burden was associated 
      with a less pronounced volume increase or a decrease in volume over the course of 
      the exercise intervention. Results of exploratory enrichment analyses reinforced 
      the notion of genetic risk factors modulating biological processes tightly 
      related to synaptic ion channel activity, calcium signaling, glutamate signaling 
      and regulation of cell morphogenesis. We hypothesize that a high polygenic risk 
      may negatively influence neuroplasticity in CA4/DG during aerobic exercise in 
      schizophrenia.

AB  - Pre-analytical treatment of blood plasma is a time consuming and often rate 
      limiting step in the workflow of LC/MS analysis. We present in this pilot study a 
      new approach for quantitative LC/MS based on weak affinity chromatography (WAC) 
      of crude plasma. The steroid hormone cortisol was selected as a clinically 
      relevant biomarker, as it currently requires extensive pre-analytical 
      preparation. A WAC unit with saturating, immobilized albumin as a prototypic weak 
      binder was used in combination with an ion-funnel MS/MS detector to perform zonal 
      affinity chromatography of cortisol directly from a plasma sample, followed by 
      quantitative multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). This procedure also allowed us 
      to determine the amount of bioavailable cortisol in the clinical plasma sample 
      which is of significant therapeutic interest. This WAC-MS approach showed an 
      excellent correlation (R(2)=0.86 (P<0.0001 (highly significant); n=60) with a 
      state-of-the-art, clinical competitive immunoassay procedure for plasma cortisol 
      analysis. With integration of WAC into LC/MS workflow, it may be possible to both 
      accelerate and improve assay performance by eliminating the sample extraction 
      step. Preliminary data with other steroid hormones indicate that WAC-MS can be 
      applied to various biomolecules using a plasma transport protein such as albumin.

AB  - We identified a non-synonymous mutation in Oas2 (I405N), a sensor of viral 
      double-stranded RNA, from an ENU-mutagenesis screen designed to discover new 
      genes involved in mammary development. The mutation caused post-partum failure of 
      lactation in healthy mice with otherwise normally developed mammary glands, 
      characterized by greatly reduced milk protein synthesis coupled with epithelial 
      cell death, inhibition of proliferation and a robust interferon response. 
      Expression of mutant but not wild type Oas2 in cultured HC-11 or T47D mammary 
      cells recapitulated the phenotypic and transcriptional effects observed in the 
      mouse. The mutation activates the OAS2 pathway, demonstrated by a 34-fold 
      increase in RNase L activity, and its effects were dependent on expression of 
      RNase L and IRF7, proximal and distal pathway members. This is the first report 
      of a viral recognition pathway regulating lactation.

TI  - AKR1C3-Mediated Adipose Androgen Generation Drives Lipotoxicity in Women With 
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.
PG  - 3327-3339
LID - 10.1210/jc.2017-00947 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent metabolic disorder 
      occurring in up to 10% of women of reproductive age. PCOS is associated with 
      insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. Androgen excess is a defining feature 
      of PCOS and has been suggested as causally associated with insulin resistance; 
      however, mechanistic evidence linking both is lacking. We hypothesized that 
      adipose tissue is an important site linking androgen activation and metabolic 
      dysfunction in PCOS. METHODS: We performed a human deep metabolic in vivo 
      phenotyping study examining the systemic and intra-adipose effects of acute and 
      chronic androgen exposure in 10 PCOS women, in comparison with 10 body mass 
      index-matched healthy controls, complemented by in vitro experiments. RESULTS: 
      PCOS women had increased intra-adipose concentrations of testosterone (P = 
      0.0006) and dihydrotestosterone (P = 0.01), with increased expression of the 
      androgen-activating enzyme aldo-ketoreductase type 1 C3 (AKR1C3) (P = 0.04) in 
      subcutaneous adipose tissue. Adipose glycerol levels in subcutaneous adipose 
      tissue microdialysate supported in vivo suppression of lipolysis after acute 
      androgen exposure in PCOS (P = 0.04). Mirroring this, nontargeted serum 
      metabolomics revealed prolipogenic effects of androgens in PCOS women only. In 
      vitro studies showed that insulin increased adipose AKR1C3 expression and 
      activity, whereas androgen exposure increased adipocyte de novo lipid synthesis. 
      Pharmacologic AKR1C3 inhibition in vitro decreased de novo lipogenesis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings define an intra-adipose mechanism of androgen 
      activation that contributes to adipose remodeling and a systemic lipotoxic 
      metabolome, with intra-adipose androgens driving lipid accumulation and insulin 
      resistance in PCOS. AKR1C3 represents a promising therapeutic target in PCOS.

AB  - Advances in high-throughput technologies allow for measurements of many types of 
      omics data, yet the meaningful integration of several different data types 
      remains a significant challenge. Another important and difficult problem is the 
      discovery of molecular disease subtypes characterized by relevant clinical 
      differences, such as survival. Here we present a novel approach, called 
      perturbation clustering for data integration and disease subtyping (PINS), which 
      is able to address both challenges. The framework has been validated on thousands 
      of cancer samples, using gene expression, DNA methylation, noncoding microRNA, 
      and copy number variation data available from the Gene Expression Omnibus, the 
      Broad Institute, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the European Genome-Phenome 
      Archive. This simultaneous subtyping approach accurately identifies known cancer 
      subtypes and novel subgroups of patients with significantly different survival 
      profiles. The results were obtained from genome-scale molecular data without any 
      other type of prior knowledge. The approach is sufficiently general to replace 
      existing unsupervised clustering approaches outside the scope of bio-medical 
      research, with the additional ability to integrate multiple types of data.

TI  - Enhancing Insights into Pulmonary Vascular Disease through a Precision Medicine 
      Approach. A Joint NHLBI-Cardiovascular Medical Research and Education Fund 
      Workshop Report.
PG  - 1661-1670
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201701-0150WS [doi]
AB  - The Division of Lung Diseases of the NHLBI and the Cardiovascular Medical 
      Education and Research Fund held a workshop to discuss how to leverage the 
      anticipated scientific output from the recently launched "Redefining Pulmonary 
      Hypertension through Pulmonary Vascular Disease Phenomics" (PVDOMICS) program to 
      develop newer approaches to pulmonary vascular disease. PVDOMICS is a 
      collaborative, protocol-driven network to analyze all patient populations with 
      pulmonary hypertension to define novel pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) 
      phenotypes. Stakeholders, including basic, translational, and clinical 
      investigators; clinicians; patient advocacy organizations; regulatory agencies; 
      and pharmaceutical industry experts, joined to discuss the application of 
      precision medicine to PVD clinical trials. Recommendations were generated for 
      discussion of research priorities in line with NHLBI Strategic Vision Goals that 
      include: (1) A national effort, involving all the stakeholders, should seek to 
      coordinate biosamples and biodata from all funded programs to a web-based 
      repository so that information can be shared and correlated with other research 
      projects. Example programs sponsored by NHLBI include PVDOMICS, Pulmonary 
      Hypertension Breakthrough Initiative, the National Biological Sample and Data 
      Repository for PAH, and the National Precision Medicine Initiative. (2) A task 
      force to develop a master clinical trials protocol for PVD to apply precision 
      medicine principles to future clinical trials. Specific features include: (a) 
      adoption of smaller clinical trials that incorporate biomarker-guided enrichment 
      strategies, using adaptive and innovative statistical designs; and (b) 
      development of newer endpoints that reflect well-defined and clinically 
      meaningful changes. (3) Development of updated and systematic variables in 
      imaging, hemodynamic, cellular, genomic, and metabolic tests that will help 
      precisely identify individual and shared features of PVD and serve as the basis 
      of novel phenotypes for therapeutic interventions.

      adaptive traits for desert acclimatization.

AB  - To investigate the phenomic and genomic traits that allow green algae to survive 
      in deserts, we characterized a ubiquitous species, Chloroidium sp. UTEX 3007, 
      which we isolated from multiple locations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 
      Metabolomic analyses of Chloroidium sp. UTEX 3007 indicated that the alga 
      accumulates a broad range of carbon sources, including several desiccation 
      tolerance-promoting sugars and unusually large stores of palmitate. Growth assays 
      revealed capacities to grow in salinities from zero to 60 g/L and to grow 
      heterotrophically on >40 distinct carbon sources. Assembly and annotation of 
      genomic reads yielded a 52.5 Mbp genome with 8153 functionally annotated genes. 
      Comparison with other sequenced green algae revealed unique protein families 
      involved in osmotic stress tolerance and saccharide metabolism that support 
      phenomic studies. Our results reveal the robust and flexible biology utilized by 
      a green alga to successfully inhabit a desert coastline.

TI  - Mini-Review: The Contribution of Intermediate Phenotypes to GxE Effects on 
      Disorders of Body Composition in the New OMICS Era.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph14091079 [doi]
LID - 1079
AB  - Studies of gene-environment (GxE) interactions describe how genetic and 
      environmental factors influence the risk of developing disease. Intermediate 
      (molecular or clinical) phenotypes (IPs) are traits or metabolic biomarkers that 
      mediate the effects of gene-environment influences on risk behaviors. Functional 
      systems genomics discovery offers mechanistic insights into how DNA variations 
      affect IPs in order to detect genetic causality for a given disease. Disorders of 
      body composition include obesity (OB), Type 2 diabetes (T2D), and osteoporosis 
      (OSTP). These pathologies are examples of how a GxE interaction contributes to 
      their development. IPs as surrogates for inherited genotypes play a key role in 
      models of genetic and environmental interactions in health outcomes. Such 
      predictive models may unravel relevant genomic and molecular pathways for 
      preventive and therapeutic interventions for OB, T2D, and OSTP. Annotation 
      strategies for genomes, in contrast to phenomes, are well advanced. They 
      generally do not measure specific aspects of the environment. Therefore, the 
      concepts of deep phenotyping and the exposome generate new avenues to exploit 
      with high-resolution technologies for analyzing this sophisticated phenome. With 
      the successful characterization of phenomes, exposomes, and genomes, 
      environmental and genetic determinants of chronic diseases can be united with 
      multi-OMICS studies that better examine GxE interactions.

TI  - Using a novel computational drug-repositioning approach (DrugPredict) to rapidly 
      identify potent drug candidates for cancer treatment.
PG  - 403-414
LID - 10.1038/onc.2017.328 [doi]
AB  - Computation-based drug-repurposing/repositioning approaches can greatly speed up 
      the traditional drug discovery process. To date, systematic and comprehensive 
      computation-based approaches to identify and validate drug-repositioning 
      candidates for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) have not been undertaken. Here, we 
      present a novel drug discovery strategy that combines a computational 
      drug-repositioning system (DrugPredict) with biological testing in cell lines in 
      order to rapidly identify novel drug candidates for EOC. DrugPredict exploited 
      unique repositioning opportunities rendered by a vast amount of disease genomics, 
      phenomics, drug treatment, and genetic pathway and uniquely revealed that 
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) rank just as high as currently used 
      ovarian cancer drugs. As epidemiological studies have reported decreased 
      incidence of ovarian cancer associated with regular intake of NSAIDs, we assessed 
      whether NSAIDs could have chemoadjuvant applications in EOC and found that (i) 
      NSAID Indomethacin induces robust cell death in primary patient-derived 
      platinum-sensitive and platinum- resistant ovarian cancer cells and ovarian 
      cancer stem cells and (ii) downregulation of β-catenin is partially driving 
      effects of Indomethacin in cisplatin-resistant cells. In summary, we demonstrate 
      that DrugPredict represents an innovative computational drug- discovery strategy 
      to uncover drugs that are routinely used for other indications that could be 
      effective in treating various cancers, thus introducing a potentially rapid and 
      cost-effective translational opportunity. As NSAIDs are already in routine use in 
      gynecological treatment regimens and have acceptable safety profile, our results 
      will provide with a rationale for testing NSAIDs as potential chemoadjuvants in 
      EOC patient trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common and highly heritable disorder of 
      mood. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several independent 
      susceptibility loci. In order to extract more biological information from GWAS 
      data, multi-locus approaches represent powerful tools since they utilize 
      knowledge about biological processes to integrate functional sets of genes at 
      strongly to moderately associated loci. METHODS: We conducted gene set enrichment 
      analyses (GSEA) using 2.3 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms, 397 Reactome 
      pathways and 24,025 patients with BD and controls. RNA expression of implicated 
      individual genes and gene sets were examined in post-mortem brains across 
      lifespan. RESULTS: Two pathways showed a significant enrichment after correction 
      for multiple comparisons in the GSEA: GRB2 events in ERBB2 signaling, for which 6 
      of 21 genes were BD associated (P(FDR) = 0.0377), and NCAM signaling for neurite 
      out-growth, for which 11 out of 62 genes were BD associated (P(FDR) = 0.0451). 
      Most pathway genes showed peaks of RNA co-expression during fetal development and 
      infancy and mapped to neocortical areas and parts of the limbic system. 
      LIMITATIONS: Pathway associations were technically reproduced by two methods, 
      although they were not formally replicated in independent samples. Gene 
      expression was explored in controls but not in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pathway 
      analysis in large GWAS data of BD and follow-up of gene expression patterns in 
      healthy brains provide support for an involvement of neurodevelopmental processes 
      in the etiology of this neuropsychiatric disease. Future studies are required to 
      further evaluate the relevance of the implicated genes on pathway functioning and 
      clinical aspects of BD.

TI  - From genomes to diaries: a 3-year prospective, real-life study of 
      ragweed-specific sublingual immunotherapy.
PG  - 1279-1294
LID - 10.2217/imt-2017-0093 [doi]
AB  - During the last decades, the prevalence of allergy has dramatically increased. 
      Allergen-specific immunotherapy is the only currently available medical 
      intervention that has the potential to affect the natural course of the disease, 
      but there are still many questions and unmet needs hindering its widespread use 
      to fulfill its treatment potential and maximize its benefits for the society. To 
      provide a comprehensive phenome-wide overview in sublingual immunotherapy, using 
      ragweed allergy as a target, we planned and carried out a longitudinal, 
      prospective, observational, open-label study (DesensIT). In this paper we present 
      challenges of using deep and comprehensive phenotypes embracing biological, 
      clinical and patient-reported outcomes in allergen-specific immunotherapy and 
      show how we designed the DesensIT project to optimize data collection, processing 
      and evaluation.

TI  - Firmness at Harvest Impacts Postharvest Fruit Softening and Internal Browning 
      Development in Mechanically Damaged and Non-damaged Highbush Blueberries 
      (Vaccinium corymbosum L.).
PG  - 535

AB  - Fresh blueberries are very susceptible to mechanical damage, which limits 
      postharvest life and firmness. Softening and susceptibility of cultivars "Duke" 
      and "Brigitta" to developing internal browning (IB) after mechanical impact and 
      subsequent storage was evaluated during a 2-year study (2011/2012, 2012/2013). On 
      each season fruit were carefully hand-picked, segregated into soft (<1.60 N), 
      medium (1.61-1.80 N), and firm (1.81-2.00 N) categories, and then either were 
      dropped (32 cm) onto a hard plastic surface or remained non-dropped. All fruit 
      were kept under refrigerated storage (0°C and 85-88% relative humidity) to assess 
      firmness loss and IB after 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days. In general, regardless of 
      cultivar or season, high variability in fruit firmness was observed within each 
      commercial harvest, and significant differences in IB and softening rates were 
      found. "Duke" exhibited high softening rates, as well as high and significant 
      r(2) between firmness and IB, but little differences for dropped vs. non-dropped 
      fruit. "Brigitta," having lesser firmness rates, exhibited almost no 
      relationships between firmness and IB (especially for non-dropped fruit), but 
      marked differences between dropping treatments. Firmness loss and IB development 
      were related to firmness at harvest, soft and firm fruit being the most and least 
      damaged, respectively. Soft fruit were characterized by greater IB development 
      during storage along with high soluble solids/acid ratio, which could be used 
      together with firmness to estimate harvest date and storage potential of fruit. 
      Results of this work suggest that the differences in fruit quality traits at 
      harvest could be related to the time that fruit stay on the plant after turning 
      blue, soft fruit being more advanced in maturity. Finally, the observed 
      differences between segregated categories reinforce the importance of analyzing 
      fruit condition for each sorted group separately.

TI  - Ecology of cold environments: new insights of bacterial metabolic adaptation

AB  - Cold environments dominate Earth's biosphere, hosting complex microbial 
      communities with the ability to thrive at low temperatures. However, the 
      underlying molecular mechanisms and the metabolic pathways involved in bacterial 
      cold-adaptation mechanisms are still not fully understood. Herein, we assessed 
      the metabolic features of the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis 
      TAC125 (PhTAC125), a model organism for cold-adaptation, at both 4 °C and 15 °C, 
      by integrating genomic and phenomic (high-throughput phenotyping) data and 
      comparing the obtained results to the taxonomically related Antarctic bacterium 
      Pseudoalteromonas sp. TB41 (PspTB41). Although the genome size of PspTB41 is 
      considerably larger than PhTAC125, the higher number of genes did not reflect any 
      higher metabolic versatility at 4 °C as compared to PhTAC125. Remarkably, protein 
      S-thiolation regulated by glutathione and glutathionylspermidine appeared to be a 
      new possible mechanism for cold adaptation in PhTAC125. More in general, this 
      study represents an example of how 'multi-omic' information might potentially 
      contribute in filling the gap between genotypic and phenotypic features related 
      to cold-adaptation mechanisms in bacteria.

TI  - Software Application Profile: PHESANT: a tool for performing automated phenome 
      scans in UK Biobank.
PG  - 29-35
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyx204 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Epidemiological cohorts typically contain a diverse set of phenotypes 
      such that automation of phenome scans is non-trivial, because they require highly 
      heterogeneous models. For this reason, phenome scans have to date tended to use a 
      smaller homogeneous set of phenotypes that can be analysed in a consistent 
      fashion. We present PHESANT (PHEnome Scan ANalysis Tool), a software package for 
      performing comprehensive phenome scans in UK Biobank. GENERAL FEATURES: PHESANT 
      tests the association of a specified trait with all continuous, integer and 
      categorical variables in UK Biobank, or a specified subset. PHESANT uses a novel 
      rule-based algorithm to determine how to appropriately test each trait, then 
      performs the analyses and produces plots and summary tables. IMPLEMENTATION: The 
      PHESANT phenome scan is implemented in R. PHESANT includes a novel Javascript 
      D3.js visualization and accompanying Java code that converts the phenome scan 
      results to the required JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. AVAILABILITY: 
      PHESANT is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/MRCIEU/PHESANT]. Git tag 
      v0.5 corresponds to the version presented here.

TI  - RNA sequencing of bipolar disorder lymphoblastoid cell lines implicates the 
      neurotrophic factor HRP-3 in lithium's clinical efficacy.
PG  - 449-461
LID - 10.1080/15622975.2017.1372629 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Lithium remains the oldest and most effective treatment for mood 
      stabilisation in bipolar disorder (BD), even though at least half of patients are 
      only partially responsive or do not respond. This study aimed to identify 
      biomarkers associated with lithium response in BD, based on comparing RNA 
      sequencing information derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) of 
      lithium-responsive (LR) versus lithium non-responsive (LNR) BD patients, to 
      assess gene expression variations that might bear on treatment outcome. Methods: 
      RNA sequencing was carried out on 24 LCLs from female BD patients (12 LR and 12 
      LNR) followed by qPCR validation in two additional independent cohorts (41 and 17 
      BD patients, respectively). Results: Fifty-six genes showed nominal differential 
      expression comparing LR and LNR (FC ≥ |1.3|, P ≤ 0.01). The differential 
      expression of HDGFRP3 and ID2 was validated by qPCR in the independent cohorts. 
      Conclusions: We observed higher expression levels of HDGFRP3 and ID2 in BD 
      patients who favourably respond to lithium. Both of these genes are involved in 
      neurogenesis, and HDGFRP3 has been suggested to be a neurotrophic factor. 
      Additional studies in larger BD cohorts are needed to confirm the potential of 
      HDGFRP3 and ID2 expression levels in blood cells as tentative favourable lithium 
      response biomarkers.

LID - 10.1038/hortres.2017.35 [doi]
AB  - Grapes are one of the most economically and culturally important crops worldwide, 
      and they have been bred for both winemaking and fresh consumption. Here we 
      evaluate patterns of diversity across 33 phenotypes collected over a 17-year 
      period from 580 table and wine grape accessions that belong to one of the world's 
      largest grape gene banks, the grape germplasm collection of the United States 
      Department of Agriculture. We find that phenological events throughout the 
      growing season are correlated, and quantify the marked difference in size between 
      table and wine grapes. By pairing publicly available historical phenotype data 
      with genome-wide polymorphism data, we identify large effect loci controlling 
      traits that have been targeted during domestication and breeding, including 
      hermaphroditism, lighter skin pigmentation and muscat aroma. Breeding for larger 
      berries in table grapes was traditionally concentrated in geographic regions 
      where Islam predominates and alcohol was prohibited, whereas wine grapes retained 
      the ancestral smaller size that is more desirable for winemaking in predominantly 
      Christian regions. We uncover a novel locus with a suggestive association with 
      berry size that harbors a signature of positive selection for larger berries. Our 
      results suggest that religious rules concerning alcohol consumption have had a 
      marked impact on patterns of phenomic and genomic diversity in grapes.

TI  - Alterations in mandibular morphology associated with glypican 1 and glypican 3 
      gene mutations.
PG  - 183-187
LID - 10.1111/ocr.12170 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Glypican 1 (GPC1) and glypican 3 (GPC3) are bone co-regulators that 
      act downstream in many of the signalling pathways associated with 
      craniosynostosis. Morphometric data from GPC-knockout mice were analysed to 
      determine whether elimination of GPC1 and GPC3 genes would alter mandibular 
      morphology. SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: The murine model included five male 
      and five female mandibles in each of GPC1-knockout, GPC1/GPC3-knockout and 
      wild-type (control) groups. Female GPC3-knockout mice had a very high rate of 
      perinatal lethality, and therefore, only five males were included in this group. 
      METHODS: The mandibular morphology of GPC1-knockout (n=10), GPC3-knockout (n=5), 
      GPC1/GPC3-knockout (n=10) and wild-type (n=10) mice was compared by analysing 
      five landmark-based linear dimensions: anterior and posterior lengths, as well as 
      ascending, descending and posterior heights. Measurements were recorded on 
      three-dimensional micro-CT reconstructions. RESULTS: GPC3-knockout mandibles were 
      larger than wild-type mandibles for all dimensions (P<.05). Mandibular heights 
      were more affected than lengths. A decreasing trend of mandibular dimensions 
      across the mouse groups 
      (GPC3-knockout>GPC1/GPC3-knockout>GPC1-knockout=wild-type) (P<.05) indicated that 
      an increase in mandibular size was associated with increased GPC3 expression, but 
      not GPC1. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in GPC3 expression are likely to mediate 
      changes to mandibular size in craniosynostosis. These findings have potential 
      future applications in the prevention and treatment of craniosynostosis and 
      associated craniofacial dysmorphology.

TI  - Growth curve registration for evaluating salinity tolerance in barley.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1186/s13007-017-0165-7 [doi]
LID - 18
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smarthouses capable of non-destructive, high-throughput plant 
      phenotyping collect large amounts of data that can be used to understand plant 
      growth and productivity in extreme environments. The challenge is to apply the 
      statistical tool that best analyzes the data to study plant traits, such as 
      salinity tolerance, or plant-growth-related traits. RESULTS: We derive 
      family-wise salinity sensitivity (FSS) growth curves and use registration 
      techniques to summarize growth patterns of HEB-25 barley families and the 
      commercial variety, Navigator. We account for the spatial variation in smarthouse 
      microclimates and in temporal variation across phenotyping runs using a 
      functional ANOVA model to derive corrected FSS curves. From FSS, we derive 
      corrected values for family-wise salinity tolerance, which are strongly 
      negatively correlated with Na but not significantly with K, indicating that Na 
      content is an important factor affecting salinity tolerance in these families, at 
      least for plants of this age and grown in these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      family-wise methodology is suitable for analyzing the growth curves of a large 
      number of plants from multiple families. The corrected curves accurately account 
      for the spatial and temporal variations among plants that are inherent to 
      high-throughput experiments.

TI  - Abiotic Stress Responses and Microbe-Mediated Mitigation in Plants: The Omics

AB  - Abiotic stresses are the foremost limiting factors for agricultural productivity. 
      Crop plants need to cope up adverse external pressure created by environmental 
      and edaphic conditions with their intrinsic biological mechanisms, failing which 
      their growth, development, and productivity suffer. Microorganisms, the most 
      natural inhabitants of diverse environments exhibit enormous metabolic 
      capabilities to mitigate abiotic stresses. Since microbial interactions with 
      plants are an integral part of the living ecosystem, they are believed to be the 
      natural partners that modulate local and systemic mechanisms in plants to offer 
      defense under adverse external conditions. Plant-microbe interactions comprise 
      complex mechanisms within the plant cellular system. Biochemical, molecular and 
      physiological studies are paving the way in understanding the complex but 
      integrated cellular processes. Under the continuous pressure of increasing 
      climatic alterations, it now becomes more imperative to define and interpret 
      plant-microbe relationships in terms of protection against abiotic stresses. At 
      the same time, it also becomes essential to generate deeper insights into the 
      stress-mitigating mechanisms in crop plants for their translation in higher 
      productivity. Multi-omics approaches comprising genomics, transcriptomics, 
      proteomics, metabolomics and phenomics integrate studies on the interaction of 
      plants with microbes and their external environment and generate multi-layered 
      information that can answer what is happening in real-time within the cells. 
      Integration, analysis and decipherization of the big-data can lead to a massive 
      outcome that has significant chance for implementation in the fields. This review 
      summarizes abiotic stresses responses in plants in-terms of biochemical and 
      molecular mechanisms followed by the microbe-mediated stress mitigation 
      phenomenon. We describe the role of multi-omics approaches in generating 
      multi-pronged information to provide a better understanding of plant-microbe 
      interactions that modulate cellular mechanisms in plants under extreme external 
      conditions and help to optimize abiotic stresses. Vigilant amalgamation of these 
      high-throughput approaches supports a higher level of knowledge generation about 
      root-level mechanisms involved in the alleviation of abiotic stresses in 
      organisms.

TI  - Disease model discovery from 3,328 gene knockouts by The International Mouse 
      Phenotyping Consortium.

AB  - Although next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the ability to associate 
      variants with human diseases, diagnostic rates and development of new therapies 
      are still limited by a lack of knowledge of the functions and pathobiological 
      mechanisms of most genes. To address this challenge, the International Mouse 
      Phenotyping Consortium is creating a genome- and phenome-wide catalog of gene 
      function by characterizing new knockout-mouse strains across diverse biological 
      systems through a broad set of standardized phenotyping tests. All mice will be 
      readily available to the biomedical community. Analyzing the first 3,328 genes 
      identified models for 360 diseases, including the first models, to our knowledge, 
      for type C Bernard-Soulier, Bardet-Biedl-5 and Gordon Holmes syndromes. 90% of 
      our phenotype annotations were novel, providing functional evidence for 1,092 
      genes and candidates in genetically uncharacterized diseases including 
      arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia 3. Finally, we describe our role in 
      variant functional validation with The 100,000 Genomes Project and others.

AB  - Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing 
      the efficiency with which solar radiation is converted into biomass has recently 
      become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude 
      modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level 
      monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light conversion and 
      photoprotection in natural environments, potentially over the entire crop 
      lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) 
      and irradiance was measured in five cultivars of rice (Oryza sativa) in canopy 
      conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar radiation. This relationship 
      differed substantially from that observed for conventional short term light 
      response curves measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. 
      This difference was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve 
      fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of 
      photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under 
      canopy solar radiation was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. 
      Genotypic variation in the irradiance at which energy flux into photoprotective 
      dissipation became greater than ETR was observed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR 
      at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, 
      estimated by noninvasive imaging.

      recurrent phenotypes.
PG  - 1167-1178
LID - 10.1007/s00109-017-1587-4 [doi]
AB  - Tumor heterogeneity has been identified at various -omic levels. The tumor 
      genome, transcriptome, proteome, and phenome can vary widely across cells in 
      patient tumors and are influenced by tumor cell interactions with heterogeneous 
      physical conditions and cellular components of the tumor microenvironment. Here, 
      we explore the concept that while variation exists at multiple -omic levels, 
      changes at each of these levels converge on the same pathways and lead to 
      convergent phenotypes in tumors that can provide common drug targets. These 
      phenotypes include cellular growth and proliferation, sustained oncogenic 
      signaling, and immune avoidance, among others. Tumor heterogeneity complicates 
      treatment of patient cancers as it leads to varied response to therapies. 
      Identification of convergent cellular phenotypes arising in patient cancers and 
      targeted therapies that reverse them has the potential to transform the way

TI  - How does mutation affect the distribution of phenotypes?
PG  - 2445-2456
LID - 10.1111/evo.13358 [doi]
AB  - The potential for mutational processes to influence patterns of neutral or 
      adaptive phenotypic evolution is not well understood. If mutations are 
      directionally biased, shifting trait means in a particular direction, or if 
      mutation generates more variance in some directions of multivariate trait space 
      than others, mutation itself might be a source of bias in phenotypic evolution. 
      Here, we use mutagenesis to investigate the affect of mutation on trait mean and 
      (co)variances in zebrafish, Danio rerio. Mutation altered the relationship 
      between age and both prolonged swimming speed and body shape. These observations 
      suggest that mutational effects on ontogeny or aging have the potential to 
      generate variance across the phenome. Mutations had a far greater effect in males 
      than females, although whether this is a reflection of sex-specific ontogeny or 
      aging remains to be determined. In males, mutations generated positive covariance 
      between swimming speed, size, and body shape suggesting the potential for 
      mutation to affect the evolutionary covariation of these traits. Overall, our 
      observations suggest that mutation does not generate equal variance in all 
      directions of phenotypic space or in each sex, and that pervasive variation in 
      ontogeny or aging within a cohort could affect the variation available to 
      evolution.

TI  - Efficient genome-wide association in biobanks using topic modeling identifies 
      multiple novel disease loci.
PG  - 285-294
LID - 10.2119/molmed.2017.00100 [doi]
AB  - Biobanks and national registries represent a powerful tool for genomic discovery, 
      but rely on diagnostic codes that may be unreliable and fail to capture the 
      relationship between related diagnoses. We developed an efficient means of 
      conducting genome-wide association studies using combinations of diagnostic codes 
      from electronic health records (EHR) for 10845 participants in a biobanking 
      program at two large academic medical centers. Specifically, we applied latent 
      Dirichilet allocation to fit 50 disease topics based on diagnostic codes, then 
      conducted genome-wide common-variant association for each topic. In sensitivity 
      analysis, these results were contrasted with those obtained from traditional 
      single-diagnosis phenome-wide association analysis, as well as those in which 
      only a subset of diagnostic codes are included per topic. In meta-analysis across 
      three biobank cohorts, we identified 23 disease-associated loci with p<1e-15, 
      including previously associated autoimmune disease loci. In all cases, observed 
      significant associations were of greater magnitude than for single phenome-wide 
      diagnostic codes, and incorporation of less strongly-loading diagnostic codes 
      enhanced association. This strategy provides a more efficient means of 
      phenome-wide association in biobanks with coded clinical data.

TI  - Expert and self-assessment of lifetime symptoms and diagnosis of major depressive 
      disorder in large-scale genetic studies in the general population: comparison of 
      a clinical interview and a self-administered checklist.
PG  - 187-196
LID - 10.1097/YPG.0000000000000182 [doi]
AB  - Major depression disorder (MDD) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder and an 
      increasing number of genetic risk variants are being identified. Investigation of 
      their influence in the general population requires accurate and efficient 
      assessment of depressive symptoms. Here, clinical interviews conducted by 
      clinicians are the gold standard. We investigated whether valid and reliable 
      clinical phenotypes can be obtained efficiently using self-administered 
      instruments. Lifetime depressive symptoms and lifetime MDD diagnosis were 
      assessed in 464 population-based individuals using a clinical interview and a 
      structured, self-administered checklist. Analyses were carried out of the 
      following: (i) intraclass correlations (ICC) between checklist and interview; 
      (ii) sensitivity/specificity of the checklist; and (iii) the association of 
      interview and checklist with a positive family history of MDD (FH-MDD+). The 
      correspondence of the self-administered checklist with the clinical interview was 
      good for most depressive symptoms (ICC=0.60-0.80) and moderate for MDD diagnosis 
      (ICC=0.45). With the consecutive inclusion of MDD diagnostic criteria, 
      sensitivity decreased from 0.67 to 0.46, whereas specificity remained high 
      (0.95). For checklist and interview, strong associations were found between 
      FH-MDD+ and most depressive symptoms and MDD diagnosis (all odds ratio≥1.83). The 
      self-administered checklist showed high reliability for both the assessment of 
      lifetime depressive symptoms and screening for individuals with no lifetime 
      diagnosis of MDD. However, attention is warranted when the aim is to identify MDD 
      cases. The positive association between depressive symptomatology and FH-MDD+ 
      indicates the usefulness of both instruments to assess patients in genetic 
      studies. Our data suggest that the more time-efficient and cost-efficient 
      self-administered instruments also allow for the assessment of depressive 
      symptoms accurate enough to investigate the influence of MDD genetic risk 
      variants in the general population.

AB  - Detection of deletions and duplications of whole exons (exon CNVs) is a key 
      requirement of genetic testing. Accurate detection of this variant type has 
      proved very challenging in targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, 
      particularly if only a single exon is involved. Many different NGS exon CNV 
      calling methods have been developed over the last five years. Such methods are 
      usually evaluated using simulated and/or in-house data due to a lack of 
      publicly-available datasets with orthogonally generated results. This hinders 
      tool comparisons, transparency and reproducibility. To provide a community 
      resource for assessment of exon CNV calling methods in targeted NGS data, we here 
      present the ICR96 exon CNV validation series. The dataset includes high-quality 
      sequencing data from a targeted NGS assay (the TruSight Cancer Panel) together 
      with Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) results for 96 
      independent samples. 66 samples contain at least one validated exon CNV and 30 
      samples have validated negative results for exon CNVs in 26 genes. The dataset 
      includes 46 exon CNVs in BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM or 
      PTEN, giving excellent representation of the cancer predisposition genes most 
      frequently tested in clinical practice. Moreover, the validated exon CNVs include 
      25 single exon CNVs, the most difficult type of exon CNV to detect. The FASTQ 
      files for the ICR96 exon CNV validation series can be accessed through the 
      European-Genome phenome Archive (EGA) under the accession number EGAS00001002428.

AB  - Leaf senescence is influenced by its life history, comprising a series of 
      developmental and physiological experiences. Exploration of the biological 
      principles underlying leaf lifespan and senescence requires a schema to trace 
      leaf phenotypes, based on the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. 
      We developed a new approach and concept that will facilitate systemic biological 
      understanding of leaf lifespan and senescence, utilizing the phenome 
      high-throughput investigator (PHI) with a single-leaf-basis phenotyping platform. 
      Our pilot tests showed empirical evidence for the feasibility of PHI for 
      quantitative measurement of leaf senescence responses and improved performance in 
      order to dissect the progression of senescence triggered by different 
      senescence-inducing factors as well as genetic mutations. Such an establishment 
      enables new perspectives to be proposed, which will be challenged for enhancing 
      our fundamental understanding on the complex process of leaf senescence. We 
      further envision that integration of phenomic data with other multi-omics data 
      obtained from transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolic studies will enable us to 
      address the underlying principles of senescence, passing through different layers 
      of information from molecule to organism.

TI  - UAV-Based Thermal Imaging for High-Throughput Field Phenotyping of Black Poplar 
      Response to Drought.

AB  - Poplars are fast-growing, high-yielding forest tree species, whose cultivation as 
      second-generation biofuel crops is of increasing interest and can efficiently 
      meet emission reduction goals. Yet, breeding elite poplar trees for drought 
      resistance remains a major challenge. Worldwide breeding programs are largely 
      focused on intra/interspecific hybridization, whereby Populus nigra L. is a 
      fundamental parental pool. While high-throughput genotyping has resulted in 
      unprecedented capabilities to rapidly decode complex genetic architecture of 
      plant stress resistance, linking genomics to phenomics is hindered by technically 
      challenging phenotyping. Relying on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote 
      sensing and imaging techniques, high-throughput field phenotyping (HTFP) aims at 
      enabling highly precise and efficient, non-destructive screening of genotype 
      performance in large populations. To efficiently support forest-tree breeding 
      programs, ground-truthing observations should be complemented with standardized 
      HTFP. In this study, we develop a high-resolution (leaf level) HTFP approach to 
      investigate the response to drought of a full-sib F(2) partially inbred 
      population (termed here 'POP6'), whose F(1) was obtained from an intraspecific P. 
      nigra controlled cross between genotypes with highly divergent phenotypes. We 
      assessed the effects of two water treatments (well-watered and moderate drought) 
      on a population of 4603 trees (503 genotypes) hosted in two adjacent experimental 
      plots (1.67 ha) by conducting low-elevation (25 m) flights with an aerial drone 
      and capturing 7836 thermal infrared (TIR) images. TIR images were undistorted, 
      georeferenced, and orthorectified to obtain radiometric mosaics. Canopy 
      temperature (T(c)) was extracted using two independent semi-automated 
      segmentation techniques, eCognition- and Matlab-based, to avoid the mixed-pixel 
      problem. Overall, results showed that the UAV platform-based thermal imaging 
      enables to effectively assess genotype variability under drought stress 
      conditions. T(c) derived from aerial thermal imagery presented a good correlation 
      with ground-truth stomatal conductance (g(s)) in both segmentation techniques. 
      Interestingly, the HTFP approach was instrumental to detect drought-tolerant 
      response in 25% of the population. This study shows the potential of UAV-based 
      thermal imaging for field phenomics of poplar and other tree species. This is 
      anticipated to have tremendous implications for accelerating forest tree genetic 
      improvement against abiotic stress.

TI  - Complex Genetics of Behavior: BXDs in the Automated Home-Cage.
PG  - 519-530
AB  - This chapter describes a use case for the genetic dissection and automated 
      analysis of complex behavioral traits using the genetically diverse panel of BXD 
      mouse recombinant inbred strains. Strains of the BXD resource differ widely in 
      terms of gene and protein expression in the brain, as well as in their behavioral 
      repertoire. A large mouse resource opens the possibility for gene finding studies 
      underlying distinct behavioral phenotypes, however, such a resource poses a 
      challenge in behavioral phenotyping. To address the specifics of large-scale 
      screening we describe how to investigate: (1) how to assess mouse behavior 
      systematically in addressing a large genetic cohort, (2) how to dissect 
      automation-derived longitudinal mouse behavior into quantitative parameters, and 
      (3) how to map these quantitative traits to the genome, deriving loci underlying 
      aspects of behavior.

AB  - This article describes public, free software that provides efficient exploratory 
      analysis of high-resolution spectral reflectance data. Spectral reflectance data 
      can suffer from problems such as poor signal to noise ratios in various wavebands 
      or invalid measurements due to changes in incoming solar radiation or operator 
      fatigue leading to poor orientation of sensors. Thus, exploratory data analysis 
      is essential to identify appropriate data for further analyses. This software 
      overcomes the problem that analysis tools such as Excel are cumbersome to use for 
      the high number of wavelengths and samples typically acquired in these studies. 
      The software, Spectral Knowledge (SK-UTALCA), was initially developed for plant 
      breeding, but it is also suitable for other studies such as precision 
      agriculture, crop protection, ecophysiology plant nutrition, and soil fertility. 
      Various spectral reflectance indices (SRIs) are often used to relate crop 
      characteristics to spectral data and the software is loaded with 255 SRIs which 
      can be applied quickly to the data. This article describes the architecture and 
      functions of SK-UTALCA and the features of the data that led to the development 
      of each of its modules.

AB  - Gut bacteria play a significant role in host insect. This study evaluated detail 
      difference of midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible 
      and field-caught populations of diamondback moth, and studied phenomics of the 
      predominant midgut bacterium Enterococcus mundtii. Cultivable bacteria revealed 
      that E. mundtii and Carnobacterium maltaromaticum dominated the bacterial 
      populations from deltamethrin-resistant and deltamethrin-susceptible larval 
      midguts, whereas E. mundtii was predominant in field-caught population. Illumina 
      sequencing analysis indicated that 97% of the midgut bacteria were from the phyla 
      Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria. Both resistant and susceptible 
      populations had more Enterococcus and Carnobacterium. Enterococcus, 
      Carnobacterium, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas were predominant in the field-caught 
      population. A phenomics analysis revealed that E. mundtii was able to metabolize 
      25.26% of the tested carbon sources, 100% of the nitrogen sources, 100% of the 
      phosphorus sources and 97.14% of the sulfur sources, had a wide range of 
      osmolytes and pH conditions, and showed active deaminase activity but no 
      decarboxylase activity. This is the first report regarding different populations 
      of DBM midgut bacteria analyzed using both high-throughput DNA sequencing and 
      cultivation methods, and also first report concerning the phenomics of E. 
      mundtii. The phenomics of E. mundtii provide a basis for the future study of gut 
      bacteria functions.

      broilers. To effectively and systematically store, manage and analyze phenotypic 
      data, we built the NEAUHLF Phenome Database (NEAUHLFPD). NEAUHLFPD included the 
      following phenotypic records: pedigree (generations 1-19) and 29 phenotypes, such 
      as body sizes and weights, carcass traits and their corresponding rates. The 
      design and construction strategy of NEAUHLFPD were executed as follows: (1) 
      Framework design. We used Apache as our web server, MySQL and Navicat as database 
      management tools, and PHP as the HTML-embedded language to create dynamic 
      interactive website. (2) Structural components. On the main interface, detailed 
      introduction on the composition, function, and the index buttons of the basic 
      structure of the database could be found. The functional modules of NEAUHLFPD had 
      two main components: the first module referred to the physical storage space for 
      phenotypic data, in which functional manipulation on data can be realized, such 
      as data indexing, filtering, range-setting, searching, etc.; the second module 
      related to the calculation of basic descriptive statistics, where data filtered 
      from the database can be used for the computation of basic statistical parameters 
      and the simultaneous conditional sorting. NEAUHLFPD could be used to effectively 
      store and manage not only phenotypic, but also genotypic and genomics data, which 
      can facilitate further investigation on the molecular genetic basis of chicken 
      adipose tissue growth and development, and expedite the selection and breeding of 
      broilers with low fat content.

TI  - Gain-of-function HCN2 variants in genetic epilepsy.
PG  - 202-209
LID - 10.1002/humu.23357 [doi]
AB  - Genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) is a common epilepsy syndrome that encompasses 
      seizure disorders characterized by spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs). Pacemaker 
      hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN) are considered 
      integral to SWD genesis, making them an ideal gene candidate for GGE. We 
      identified HCN2 missense variants from a large cohort of 585 GGE patients, 
      recruited by the Epilepsy Phenome-Genome Project (EPGP), and performed functional 
      analysis using two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus oocytes. The 
      p.S632W variant was identified in a patient with idiopathic photosensitive 
      occipital epilepsy and segregated in the family. This variant was also 
      independently identified in an unrelated patient with childhood absence seizures 
      from a European cohort of 238 familial GGE cases. The p.V246M variant was 
      identified in a patient with photo-sensitive GGE and his father diagnosed with 
      juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Functional studies revealed that both p.S632W and 
      p.V246M had an identical functional impact including a depolarizing shift in the 
      voltage dependence of activation that is consistent with a gain-of-function. In 
      contrast, no biophysical changes resulted from the introduction of common 
      population variants, p.E280K and p.A705T, and the p.R756C variant from EPGP that 
      did not segregate with disease. Our data suggest that HCN2 variants can confer 
      susceptibility to GGE via a gain-of-function mechanism.

AB  - Automated phenotyping is essential for the creation of large, highly standardized 
      datasets from anatomical imaging data. Such datasets can support large-scale 
      studies of complex traits or clinical studies related to precision medicine or 
      clinical trials. We have developed a method that generates three-dimensional 
      landmark data that meet the requirements of standard geometric morphometric 
      analyses. The method is robust and can be implemented without high-performance 
      computing resources. We validated the method using both direct comparison to 
      manual landmarking on the same individuals and also analyses of the variation 
      patterns and outlier patterns in a large dataset of automated and manual landmark 
      data. Direct comparison of manual and automated landmarks reveals that automated 
      landmark data are less variable, but more highly integrated and reproducible. 
      Automated data produce covariation structure that closely resembles that of 
      manual landmarks. We further find that while our method does produce some 
      landmarking errors, they tend to be readily detectable and can be fixed by 
      adjusting parameters used in the registration and control-point steps. Data 
      generated using the method described here have been successfully used to study 
      the genomic architecture of facial shape in two different genome-wide association 
      studies of facial shape.

AB  - Identifying genetic and environmental factors that impact complex traits and 
      common diseases is a high biomedical priority. Here, we developed, validated, and 
      implemented a series of multi-layered systems approaches, including 
      (expression-based) phenome-wide association, transcriptome-/proteome-wide 
      association, and (reverse-) mediation analysis, in an open-access web server 
      (systems-genetics.org) to expedite the systems dissection of gene function. We 
      applied these approaches to multi-omics datasets from the BXD mouse genetic 
      reference population, and identified and validated associations between genes and 
      clinical and molecular phenotypes, including previously unreported links between 
      Rpl26 and body weight, and Cpt1a and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, through 
      mediation and reverse-mediation analysis we established regulatory relations 
      between genes, such as the co-regulation of BCKDHA and BCKDHB protein levels, and 
      identified targets of transcription factors E2F6, ZFP277, and ZKSCAN1. Our 
      multifaceted toolkit enabled the identification of gene-gene and gene-phenotype 
      links that are robust and that translate well across populations and species, and 
      can be universally applied to any populations with multi-omics datasets.

AB  - Human cytosolic sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1) is considered to be one of the 
      most important SULT isoforms for metabolism, detoxification, and carcinogenesis. 
      This theory is driven by observations that SULT1A1 is widely expressed in 
      multiple tissues and acts on a wide range of phenolic substrates. SULT1A1 is 
      subject to functional common copy number variation (CNV) including deletions or 
      duplications. However, it is less clear how SULT1A1 CNV impacts health and 
      disease. To better understand the biological role of SULT1A1 in human health, we 
      genotyped CNV in 14,275 Marshfield Clinic patients linked to an extensive 
      electronic health record. Since SULT1A1 is linked to steroid metabolism, select 
      serum steroid hormones were measured in 100 individuals with a wide spectrum of 
      SULT1A1 CNV genotypes. Furthermore, comprehensive phenome-wide association 
      studies (PheWAS) were conducted using diagnostic codes and clinical text data. 
      For the first time, individuals homozygous null for SULT1A1 were identified in a 
      human population. Thirty-six percent of the population carried >2 copies of 
      SULT1A1 whereas 4% had ≤1 copy. Results indicate SULT1A1 CNV was negatively 
      correlated with estrone-sulfate to estrone ratio predominantly in males (E1S/E1; 
      p=0.03, r=-0.21) and may be associated with increased risk for common allergies. 
      The effect of SULT1A1 CNV on circulating estrogen metabolites was opposite to the 
      predicted CNV-metabolite trend based on enzymatic function. This finding, and the 
      potential association with common allergies reported herein, warrants future 
      studies.

TI  - Dynamic metabolic responses of brown planthoppers towards susceptible and 
      resistant rice plants.
PG  - 1346-1357
LID - 10.1111/pbi.12721 [doi]
AB  - Brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål, BPH) causes huge economic losses in 
      rice-growing regions, and new strategies for combating BPH are required. To 
      understand how BPHs respond towards BPH-resistant plants, we systematically 
      analysed the metabolic differences between BPHs feeding on the resistant and 
      susceptible plants using NMR and GC-FID/MS. We also measured the expression of 
      some related genes involving glycolysis and biosyntheses of trehalose, amino 
      acids, chitin and fatty acids using real-time PCR. BPH metabonome was dominated 
      by more than 60 metabolites including fatty acids, amino acids, carbohydrates, 
      nucleosides/nucleotides and TCA cycle intermediates. After initial 12 h, BPHs 
      feeding on the resistant plants had lower levels of amino acids, glucose, fatty 
      acids and TCA cycle intermediates than on the susceptible ones. The levels of 
      these metabolites recovered after 24 h feeding. This accompanied with increased 
      level in trehalose, choline metabolites and nucleosides/nucleotides compared with 
      BPH feeding on the susceptible plants. Decreased levels of BPH metabolites at the 
      early feeding probably resulted from less BPH uptakes of sap from resistant 
      plants and recovery of BPH metabolites at the later stage probably resulted from 
      their adaptation to the adverse environment with their increased hopping 
      frequency to ingest more sap together with contributions from yeast-like 
      symbionts in BPHs. Throughout 96 h, BPH feeding on the resistant plants showed 
      significant up-regulation of chitin synthase catalysing biosynthesis of chitin 
      for insect exoskeleton, peritrophic membrane lining gut and tracheae. These 
      findings provided useful metabolic information for understanding the BPH-rice 
      interactions and perhaps for developing new BPH-combating strategies.

TI  - Diffusion radiomics analysis of intratumoral heterogeneity in a murine prostate 
      cancer model following radiotherapy: Pixelwise correlation with histology.
PG  - 483-489
LID - 10.1002/jmri.25583 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the biological meaning of apparent diffusion coefficient 
      (ADC) values in tumors following radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five mice 
      bearing TRAMP-C1 tumor were half-irradiated with a dose of 15 Gy. 
      Diffusion-weighted images, using multiple b-values from 0 to 3000 s/mm(2) , were 
      acquired at 7T on day 6. ADC values calculated by a two-point estimate and 
      monoexponential fitting of signal decay were compared between the irradiated and 
      nonirradiated regions of the tumor. Pixelwise ADC maps were correlated with 
      histological metrics including nuclear counts, nuclear sizes, nuclear spaces, 
      cytoplasmic spaces, and extracellular spaces. RESULTS: As compared with the 
      nonirradiated region, the irradiated region exhibited significant increases in 
      ADC, extracellular space, and nuclear size, and a significant decrease in nuclear 
      counts (P < 0.001 for all). Optimal ADC to differentiate the irradiated from 
      nonirradiated regions was achieved at a b-value of 800 s/mm(2) by the two-point 
      method and monoexponential curve fitting. ADC positively correlated with 
      extracellular spaces (r = 0.74) and nuclear sizes (r = 0.72), and negatively 
      correlated with nuclear counts (r = -0.82, P < 0.001 for all). CONCLUSION: As a 
      radiomic biomarker, ADC maps correlating with histological metrics pixelwise 
      could be a means of evaluating tumor heterogeneity and responses to radiotherapy.

TI  - Taurine up-regulated gene 1 functions as a master regulator to coordinate 
      glycolysis and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 188-203
LID - 10.1002/hep.29462 [doi]
AB  - Cancer cells display altered glucose metabolism characterized by a preference for 
      aerobic glycolysis. The aerobic glycolytic phenotype of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) is often correlated with tumor progression and poorer clinical outcomes. 
      However, the issue of whether glycolytic metabolism influences metastasis in HCC 
      remains unclear. In the current study, we showed that knockdown of taurine 
      up-regulated gene 1 (TUG1) induces marked inhibition of cell migration, invasion, 
      and glycolysis through suppression of microRNA (miR)-455-3p. MiR-455-3p, which is 
      transcriptionally repressed by p21, directly targets the 3' untranslated region 
      of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase subunit beta 2 (AMPKβ2). The 
      TUG1/miR-455-3p/AMPKβ2 axis regulates cell growth, metastasis, and glycolysis 
      through regulation of hexokinase 2 (HK2). TUG1 is clearly associated with HK2 
      overexpression and unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients. CONCLUSION: Our data 
      collectively highlight that novel regulatory associations among TUG1, miR-455-3p, 
      AMPKβ2, and HK2 are an important determinant of glycolytic metabolism and 
      metastasis in HCC cells and support the potential utility of targeting TUG1/HK2 
      as a therapeutic strategy for HCC. (Hepatology 2018;67:188-203).

AB  - Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to maintain viability via genetic 
      mutations and epigenetic alterations, expressing overall dynamic heterogeneity. 
      The complex relaxation mechanisms of nuclear spins provide unique and convertible 
      tissue contrasts, making magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance 
      spectroscopy (MRS) pertinent imaging tools in both clinics and research. In this 
      review, we summarized MR methods that visualize tumor characteristics and its 
      metabolic phenotypes on an anatomical, microvascular, microstructural, 
      microenvironmental, and metabolomics scale. The review will progress from the 
      utilities of basic spin-relaxation contrasts in cancer imaging to more advanced 
      imaging methods that measure tumor-distinctive parameters such as perfusion, 
      water diffusion, magnetic susceptibility, oxygenation, acidosis, redox state, and 
      cell death. Analytical methods to assess tumor heterogeneity are also reviewed in 
      brief. Although the clinical utility of tumor heterogeneity from imaging is 
      debatable, the quantification of tumor heterogeneity using functional and 
      metabolic MR images with development of robust analytical methods and improved MR 
      methods may offer more critical roles of tumor heterogeneity data in clinics. 
      MRI/MRS can also provide insightful information on pharmacometabolomics, 
      biomarker discovery, disease diagnosis and prognosis, and treatment response. 
      With these future directions in mind, we anticipate the widespread utilization of 
      these MR-based techniques in studying in vivo cancer biology to better address 
      significant clinical needs.

TI  - Endometrial cancer with cervical stromal invasion: diagnostic accuracy of 
      diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging at 3T.
PG  - 1867-1876
LID - 10.1007/s00330-016-4583-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of diffusion-weighted (DW) and 
      dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for detecting 
      cervical stromal invasion in endometrial cancer. METHODS: Eighty-three 
      consecutive women with endometrial cancer underwent preoperative evaluation in a 
      3-T unit, including T2-weighted, DW (b = 0 and 1000 s/mm(2)), and DCE MR imaging. 
      Two radiologists independently assessed presence of cervical stromal invasion, 
      with histopathological reference as gold standard. RESULTS: For assessing 
      cervical stromal invasion, the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, 
      respectively for Reader 1/Reader 2, were as follows: DW MR imaging- 
      95.2 %/91.6 %, 91.7 %/100 %, and 95.8 %/90.1 %; DCE MR imaging- 91.6 %/88 %, 
      58.3 %/50 %, and 97.2 %/94.4 %. The diagnostic performance of DW MR imaging 
      (Reader 1: areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.98; 
      Reader 2: AUC = 0.97) was significantly higher than that of DCE MR imaging 
      (p = 0.009 for Reader 2) or T2-weighted MR imaging (Reader 1: p = 0.006; Reader 
      2: p = 0.013). Patients with cervical stromal invasion showed a significantly 
      greater canal width (p < 0.0001) and myometrial invasion extent (p = 0.006). 
      CONCLUSIONS: DW MR imaging has superior diagnostic performance compared with DCE 
      MR imaging in the detection of cervical stromal invasion. KEY POINTS: • DWI 
      demonstrates a higher accuracy than DCE in detecting cervical stromal invasion. • 
      Tumour ADC values are similar between patients without or with cervical invasion. 
      • Canal widening causes false-negativity on DCE and T2W but not on DWI.

TI  - (1) H MR spectroscopy in cervical carcinoma using external phase array body coil 
      at 3.0 Tesla: Prediction of poor prognostic human papillomavirus genotypes.
PG  - 899-907
LID - 10.1002/jmri.25386 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the clinical value of proton ((1) H) MR spectroscopy in 
      cervical carcinomas, in the prediction of poor prognostic human papillomavirus 
      (HPV) genotypes as well as persistent disease following concurrent 
      chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: (1) H MR spectroscopy using 
      external phase array coil was performed in 52 consecutive cervical cancer 
      patients at 3 Tesla (T). Poor prognostic HPV genotypes (alpha-7 species or 
      absence of HPV infection) and persistent cervical carcinoma after CCRT were 
      recorded. Statistical significance was calculated with the Mann-Whitney two-sided 
      nonparametric test and areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve 
      (AUC) analysis. RESULTS: A 4.3-fold (P = 0.032) increased level of methyl 
      resonance at 0.9 ppm was found in the poor prognostic HPV genotypes, mainly 
      attributed to the presence of HPV18, with a sensitivity of 75%, a specificity of 
      81%, and an AUC of 0.76. Poor prognostic HPV genotypes were more frequently 
      observed in patients with adeno-/adenosquamous carcinoma (Chi-square, 
      P < 0.0001). In prediction of the four patients with persistent disease after 
      CCRT, elevated methyl resonance demonstrated a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity 
      of 74%, and an AUC of 0.82. CONCLUSION: (1) H MR spectroscopy at 3T can be used 
      to depict the elevated lipid resonance levels in cervical carcinomas, as well as 
      help to predict the poor prognostic HPV genotypes and persistent disease 
      following CCRT. Further large studies with longer follow up times are warranted 
      to validate our initial findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging

AB  - PURPOSE: Ethnic variation in epilepsy classification was reported in the Epilepsy 
      Phenome/Genome Project. This study aimed to determine the ethnic variation in the 
      prevalence of genetic (idiopathic) generalized epilepsy (GGE) and GGE with family 
      history in a multi-ethnic Asian population in Malaysia. METHOD: In this 
      cross-sectional study, 392 patients with a clinical diagnosis of GGE were 
      recruited in the neurology outpatient clinic, University of Malaya Medical Centre 
      (UMMC), from January 2011 till April 2016. RESULTS: In our epilepsy cohort 
      (n=2100), 18.7% were diagnosed to have GGE. Of those, 28.6% >(N=112) had family 
      history of epilepsy with a mean age of seizure onset of 16.5 years old, and 42.0% 
      had myoclonic seizures (N=47). The lifetime prevalence of epilepsy among 
      first-degree relative of those with GGE and positive family history was 15.0%. 
      Analysis according to ethnicity showed that Malaysian Chinese had the lowest 
      percentage of GGE among those with epilepsy (12.3%), as compared with Indian and 
      Malay (25.3% and 21.3%, p<0.001). In addition, 32.1% of these Indian patients 
      with GGE had positive family history, which is more than the Malay (26.4%) and 
      Chinese (27.5%) ethnic groups. Consanguineous marriage was noted in 5 Indian 
      families with positive family history (9.6%). CONCLUSION: There was ethnic 
      variation in the prevalence of GGE, whereby the Malaysian Chinese had the lowest 
      percentage of GGE as compared with Indian and Malay. A substantial proportion of 
      GGE had positive family history among the three ethnics groups.

TI  - Phenome-Wide Association Study of Autoantibodies to Citrullinated and 
      Noncitrullinated Epitopes in Rheumatoid Arthritis.
PG  - 742-749
LID - 10.1002/art.39974 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop autoantibodies against 
      a spectrum of antigens, but the clinical significance of these autoantibodies is 
      unclear. Using a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach, we examined 
      the association between autoantibodies and clinical subphenotypes of RA. METHODS: 
      This study was conducted in a cohort of RA patients identified from the 
      electronic medical records (EMRs) of 2 tertiary care centers. Using a published 
      multiplex bead assay, we measured 36 autoantibodies targeting epitopes implicated 
      in RA. We extracted all International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision 
      (ICD-9) codes for each subject and grouped them into disease categories (PheWAS 
      codes), using a published method. We tested for the association of each 
      autoantibody (grouped by the targeted protein) with PheWAS codes. To determine 
      significant associations (at a false discovery rate [FDR] of ≤0.1), we reviewed 
      the medical records of 50 patients with each PheWAS code to determine positive 
      predictive values (PPVs). RESULTS: We studied 1,006 RA patients; the mean ± SD 
      age of the patients was 61.0 ± 12.9 years, and 79.0% were female. A total of 
      3,568 unique ICD-9 codes were grouped into 625 PheWAS codes; the 206 PheWAS codes 
      with a prevalence of ≥3% were studied. Using the PheWAS method, we identified 24 
      significant associations of autoantibodies to epitopes at an FDR of ≤0.1. The 
      associations that were strongest and had the highest PPV for the PheWAS code were 
      autoantibodies against fibronectin and obesity (P = 6.1 × 10(-4) , PPV 100%), and 
      that between fibrinogen and pneumonopathy (P = 2.7 × 10(-4) , PPV 96%). 
      Pneumonopathy codes included diagnoses for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia and 
      obliterative bronchiolitis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated application of a 
      bioinformatics method, the PheWAS, to screen for the clinical significance of 
      RA-related autoantibodies. Using the PheWAS approach, we identified potentially 
      significant links between variations in the levels of autoantibodies and 
      comorbidities of interest in RA.

TI  - Subchondral mesenchymal stem cells from osteoarthritic knees display high 
      osteogenic differentiation capacity through microRNA-29a regulation of HDAC4.
PG  - 1327-1340
LID - 10.1007/s00109-017-1583-8 [doi]
AB  - Subchondral bone deterioration and osteophyte formation attributable to excessive 
      mineralization are prominent features of end-stage knee osteoarthritis (OA). The 
      cellular events underlying subchondral integrity diminishment remained elusive. 
      This study was undertaken to characterize subchondral mesenchymal stem cells 
      (SMSCs) isolated from patients with end-stage knee OA who required total knee 
      arthroplasty. The SMSCs expressed surface antigens CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, 
      and CD166 and lacked CD31, CD45, and MHCII expression. The cell cultures 
      exhibited higher proliferation and greater osteogenesis and chondrogenesis 
      potencies, whereas their population-doubling time and adipogenic lineage 
      commitment were lower than those of bone marrow MSCs (BMMSCs). They also 
      displayed higher expressions of embryonic stem cell marker OCT3/4 and osteogenic 
      factors Wnt3a, β-catenin, and microRNA-29a (miR-29a), concomitant with lower 
      expressions of joint-deleterious factors HDAC4, TGF-β1, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MMP3, 
      in comparison with those of BMMSCs. Knockdown of miR-29a lowered Wnt3a expression 
      and osteogenic differentiation of the SMSCs through elevating HDAC4 translation, 
      which directly regulated the 3'-untranslated region of HDAC4. Likewise, 
      transgenic mice that overexpressed miR-29a in osteoblasts exhibited a high bone 
      mass in the subchondral region. SMSCs in the transgenic mice showed a higher 
      osteogenic differentiation and lower HDAC4 signaling than those in wild-type 
      mice. Taken together, high osteogenesis potency existed in the SMSCs in the 
      osteoarthritic knee. The miR-29a modulation of HDAC4 and Wnt3a signaling was 
      attributable to the increase in osteogenesis. This study shed an emerging light 
      on the characteristics of SMSCs and highlighted the contribution of SMSCs in the 
      exacerbation of subchondral integrity in end-stage knee OA. KEY MESSAGES: 
      Subchondral MSCs (SMSCs) from OA knee expressed embryonic stem cell marker 
      Oct3/4. The SMSCs showed high proliferation and osteogenic and chondrogenic 
      potencies. miR-29a regulated osteogenesis of the SMSCs through modulation of 
      HDAC4 and Wnt3a. A high osteogenic potency of the SMSCs existed in mice 
      overexpressing miR-29a in bone. Aberrant osteogenesis in SMSCs provides a new 
      insight to subchondral damage in OA.

TI  - The Mitotic Function of Augmin Is Dependent on Its Microtubule-Associated Protein 
      Subunit EDE1 in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 3891-3897.e4
LID - S0960-9822(17)31475-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.cub.2017.11.030 [doi]
AB  - The augmin complex plays an essential role in microtubule (MT)-dependent MT 
      nucleation by recruiting the γ-tubulin complex to MT walls to generate new MTs 
      [1]. The complex contains eight subunits (designated AUG) including AUG8, which 
      is an MT-associated protein (MAP). When this complex is isolated from etiolated 
      seedlings consisting of primarily interphase cells in Arabidopsis thaliana, AUG8 
      is an integral component [2]. EDE1 (Endosperm DEfective 1) is homologous to AUG8 
      [3]. Here, we demonstrate that EDE1, but not AUG8, is associated with 
      acentrosomal spindle and phragmoplast MT arrays in patterns indistinguishable 
      from those of the AUG1-7 subunits and the γ-tubulin complex proteins (GCPs) that 
      exhibit biased localization toward MT minus ends. Consistent with this 
      colocalization, EDE1 directly interacts with AUG6 in vivo. Moreover, a partial 
      loss-of-function mutation, ede1-1, compromises the localization of augmin and 
      γ-tubulin on the spindle and phragmoplast MT arrays and leads to serious 
      distortions in spindle MT remodeling during mitosis. However, mitosis continues 
      even when kinetochore fibers are not obviously discernable, and cytokinesis takes 
      place following the formation of elongated bipolar phragmoplast MT arrays in the 
      mutant. Hence, we conclude that the mitotic function of augmin is dependent on 
      its MAP subunit EDE1, which cannot be replaced by AUG8, and that the 
      cell-cycle-dependent function of augmin can be differentially regulated by 
      employing distinct MAP subunits. Our results also illustrate that plant cells can 
      respond flexibly to serious challenges of compromised MT-dependent MT nucleation 
      to complete mitosis and cytokinesis.

TI  - Elucidation of the Metabolic Network of Helicobacter pylori J99 and Malaysian 
      Clinical Strains by Phenotype Microarray.
LID - 10.1111/hel.12321 [doi]
LID - e12321
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori colonizes almost half of the human population 
      worldwide. H. pylori strains are genetically diverse, and the specific genotypes 
      are associated with various clinical manifestations including gastric 
      adenocarcinoma, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD). 
      However, our current knowledge of the H. pylori metabolism is limited. To 
      understand the metabolic differences among H. pylori strains, we investigated 
      four Malaysian H. pylori clinical strains, which had been previously sequenced, 
      and a standard strain, H. pylori J99, at the phenotypic level. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The phenotypes of the H. pylori strains were profiled using the Biolog 
      Phenotype Microarray system to corroborate genomic data. We initiated the 
      analyses by predicting carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways from the H. pylori 
      genomic data from the KEGG database. Biolog PM aided the validation of the 
      prediction and provided a more intensive analysis of the H. pylori phenomes. 
      RESULTS: We have identified a core set of metabolic nutrient sources that was 
      utilized by all strains tested and another set that was differentially utilized 
      by only the local strains. Pentose sugars are the preferred carbon nutrients 
      utilized by H. pylori. The amino acids l-aspartic acid, d-alanine, and 
      l-asparagine serve as both carbon and nitrogen sources in the metabolism of the 
      bacterium. CONCLUSION: The phenotypic profile based on this study provides a 
      better understanding on the survival of H. pylori in its natural host. Our data 
      serve as a foundation for future challenges in correlating interstrain metabolic 
      differences in H. pylori.

TI  - Phenotypic diversity and genotypic flexibility of Burkholderia cenocepacia during 
      long-term chronic infection of cystic fibrosis lungs.
PG  - 650-662
LID - 10.1101/gr.213363.116 [doi]
AB  - Chronic bacterial infections of the lung are the leading cause of morbidity and 
      mortality in cystic fibrosis patients. Tracking bacterial evolution during 
      chronic infections can provide insights into how host selection 
      pressures-including immune responses and therapeutic interventions-shape 
      bacterial genomes. We carried out genomic and phenotypic analyses of 215 serially 
      collected Burkholderia cenocepacia isolates from 16 cystic fibrosis patients, 
      spanning a period of 2-20 yr and a broad range of epidemic lineages. Systematic 
      phenotypic tests identified longitudinal bacterial series that manifested 
      progressive changes in liquid media growth, motility, biofilm formation, and 
      acute insect virulence, but not in mucoidy. The results suggest that distinct 
      lineages follow distinct evolutionary trajectories during lung infection. 
      Pan-genome analysis identified 10,110 homologous gene clusters present only in a 
      subset of strains, including genes restricted to different molecular types. Our 
      phylogenetic analysis based on 2148 orthologous gene clusters from all isolates 
      is consistent with patient-specific clades. This suggests that initial 
      colonization of patients was likely by individual strains, followed by subsequent 
      diversification. Evidence of clonal lineages shared by some patients was 
      observed, suggesting inter-patient transmission. We observed recurrent gene 
      losses in multiple independent longitudinal series, including complete loss of 
      Chromosome III and deletions on other chromosomes. Recurrently observed 
      loss-of-function mutations were associated with decreases in motility and biofilm 
      formation. Together, our study provides the first comprehensive genome-phenome 
      analyses of B. cenocepacia infection in cystic fibrosis lungs and serves as a 
      valuable resource for understanding the genomic and phenotypic underpinnings of 
      bacterial evolution.

TI  - msPurity: Automated Evaluation of Precursor Ion Purity for Mass 
      Spectrometry-Based Fragmentation in Metabolomics.
PG  - 2432-2439
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04358 [doi]
AB  - Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS or MS(2)) is a widely used approach for 
      structural annotation and identification of metabolites in complex biological 
      samples. The importance of assessing the contribution of the precursor ion within 
      an isolation window for MS(2) experiments has been previously detailed in 
      proteomics, where precursor ion purity influences the quality and accuracy of 
      matching to mass spectral libraries, but to date, there has been little attention 
      to this data-processing technique in metabolomics. Here, we present msPurity, a 
      vendor-independent R package for liquid chromatography (LC) and direct infusion 
      (DI) MS(2) that calculates a simple metric to describe the contribution of the 
      selected precursor. The precursor purity metric is calculated as "intensity of a 
      selected precursor divided by the summed intensity of the isolation window". The 
      metric is interpolated at the recorded point of MS(2) acquisition using bordering 
      full-scan spectra. Isotopic peaks of the selected precursor can be removed, and 
      low abundance peaks that are believed to have limited contribution to the 
      resulting MS(2) spectra are removed. Additionally, the isolation efficiency of 
      the mass spectrometer can be taken into account. The package was applied to Data 
      Dependent Acquisition (DDA)-based MS(2) metabolomics data sets derived from three 
      metabolomics data repositories. For the 10 LC-MS(2) DDA data sets with > ±1 Da 
      isolation windows, the median precursor purity score ranged from 0.67 to 0.96 
      (scale = 0 to +1). The R package was also used to assess precursor purity of 
      theoretical isolation windows from LC-MS data sets of differing sample types. The 
      theoretical isolation windows being the same width used for an anticipated DDA 
      experiment (±0.5 Da). The most complex sample had a median precursor purity score 
      of 0.46 for the 64,498 XCMS determined features, in comparison to the less 
      spectrally complex sample that had a purity score of 0.66 for 5071 XCMS features. 
      It has been previously reported in proteomics that a purity score of <0.5 can 
      produce unreliable spectra matching results. With this assumption, we show that 
      for complex samples there will be a large number of metabolites where traditional 
      DDA approaches will struggle to provide reliable annotations or accurate matches 
      to mass spectral libraries.

TI  - mzML2ISA & nmrML2ISA: generating enriched ISA-Tab metadata files from 
      metabolomics XML data.
PG  - 2598-2600
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btx169 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Submission to the MetaboLights repository for metabolomics data 
      currently places the burden of reporting instrument and acquisition parameters in 
      ISA-Tab format on users, who have to do it manually, a process that is time 
      consuming and prone to user input error. Since the large majority of these 
      parameters are embedded in instrument raw data files, an opportunity exists to 
      capture this metadata more accurately. Here we report a set of Python packages 
      that can automatically generate ISA-Tab metadata file stubs from raw XML 
      metabolomics data files. The parsing packages are separated into mzML2ISA 
      (encompassing mzML and imzML formats) and nmrML2ISA (nmrML format only). Overall, 
      the use of mzML2ISA & nmrML2ISA reduces the time needed to capture metadata 
      substantially (capturing 90% of metadata on assay and sample levels), is much 
      less prone to user input errors, improves compliance with minimum information 
      reporting guidelines and facilitates more finely grained data exploration and 
      querying of datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: mzML2ISA & nmrML2ISA are 
      available under version 3 of the GNU General Public Licence at

AB  - Simões et al. () argued that large matrices are linked to the construction of 
      "problematic" characters, and that those characters negatively affect tree 
      topology. In their re-evaluation of two squamate datasets, however, Simões et al. 
      () simply eliminated what they termed "problematic" characters, rather than 
      recode them. This practice ignores potential sources of phylogenetic information 
      and, if it were to be more widely followed, would inhibit the advancement of the 
      field of systematics. Here, we defend the necessity and inevitability of large 
      morphological (phenomic) datasets and discuss best practices for morphological 
      data collection in contemporary phylogenetics.

TI  - Spontaneous miscarriage in first trimester pregnancy is associated with altered 
      urinary metabolite profile.
PG  - 48-55
LID - 10.1016/j.bbacli.2017.07.003 [doi]
AB  - Threatened miscarriage is the most common gynecological emergency, occurring in 
      about 20% of pregnant women. Approximately one in four of these patients go on to 
      have spontaneous miscarriage and the etiology of miscarriage still remains 
      elusive. In a bid to identify possible biomarkers and novel treatment targets, 
      many studies have been undertaken to elucidate the pathways that lead to a 
      miscarriage. Luteal phase deficiency has been shown to contribute to 
      miscarriages, and the measurement of serum progesterone as a prognostic marker 
      and the prescription of progesterone supplementation has been proposed as 
      possible diagnostic and treatment methods. However, luteal phase deficiency only 
      accounts for 35% of miscarriages. In order to understand the other causes of 
      spontaneous miscarriage and possible novel urine biomarkers for miscarriage, we 
      looked at the changes in urinary metabolites in women with threatened 
      miscarriage. To this end, we performed a case-control study of eighty patients 
      who presented with threatened miscarriage between 6 and 10 weeks gestation. Urine 
      metabolomics analyses of forty patients with spontaneous miscarriages and forty 
      patients with ongoing pregnancies at 16 weeks gestation point to an impaired 
      placental mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids as the possible cause of 
      spontaneous miscarriage. This study also highlighted the potential of urine 
      metabolites as a non-invasive screening tool for the risk stratification of women 
      presenting with threatened miscarriage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Shoulder stiffness is a disease manifested by pain, limited range of 
      motion, and functional disability. The inflammatory and fibrosis processes play a 
      substantial role in the pathogenesis of shoulder stiffness. The CB1 receptor has 
      been recognized to mediate the processes of pathologic fibrosis. This study 
      investigated the role of the CB1 pathway in pathogenesis of rotator cuff lesions 
      with shoulder stiffness. METHODS: All of the patients undergoing repair surgery 
      for rotator cuff lesions were recruited and subcategorized into subjects with and 
      without shoulder stiffness. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay 
      was used to evaluate the expression level of CB1 and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in 
      the subacromial bursae, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure 
      the concentration of CB1 and IL-1β in the subacromial fluid. Tenocytes treated 
      with CB1 agonists and antagonists were also studied for the relationship of CB1 
      and the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. RESULTS: The patients with shoulder 
      stiffness had higher messenger RNA (mRNA) expression (P = .040) and 
      immunohistochemistry staining (P < .001) of CB1 in the subacromial bursa and 
      higher CB1 concentration in the subacromial fluid (P = .008). Tenocytes treated 
      with the CB1 agonist WIN 55,212-2 and antagonist AM251 showed increased 
      expression of IL-1β mRNA (P = .049) and suppressed expression of IL-1β mRNA 
      (P = .001), respectively. DISCUSSION: The CB1 pathway is involved in the 
      pathogenesis of shoulder stiffness. It may be a promising target for the 
      treatment of rotator cuff lesions with shoulder stiffness.

AB  - Synovitis contributes to the development of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. 
      MicroRNAs regulate joint microenvironment homeostasis and deterioration. This 
      study was undertaken to characterize the actions of microRNA-29a (miR-29a) to 
      synovial remodeling in OA joints. Synovial specimens isolated from patients with 
      end-stage OA knees showed abundant fibrotic matrix and vessel histopathology 
      concomitant with weak miR-29a expression. In vitro, miR-29a knockdown caused 
      synovial fibroblasts to exhibit high expressions of collagen III, TGF-β1, MMP9, 
      MMP13, and ADAMTS5, whereas miR-29a overexpression diminished these 
      joint-deleterious factors. In collagenase-mediated OA pathogenesis, 
      miR-29a-overexpressing transgenic mice showed minor responses to hyperplasia, 
      macrophage infiltration, fibrosis, hyperangiogenesis, and VEGF expression in 
      synovial lesions. These effects mitigated articular cartilage loss and gait 
      aberrance of injured joints. Intra-articular administration of miR-29a precursor 
      lessened the collagenase aggravation of excessive synovial remodeling reactions 
      and thereby sustained joint tissue integrity. miR-29a lowered VEGF production and 
      angiogenic activities in synovial fibroblasts through targeting the 3'-UTR of 
      VEGF. Taken together, miR-29a deficiency exacerbated synovitis pathogenesis in 
      the end-stage OA knees. miR-29a signaling fends off excessive synovial 
      angiogenesis and fibrosis, which delays joint destruction. This study sheds new 
      light on the protective effects against synovial deterioration and the 
      therapeutic advantage of miR-29a in OA knees.

TI  - Phenotyping of plants in competitive but controlled environments: a study of 
      drought response in transgenic wheat.
PG  - 290-301
LID - 10.1071/FP16202 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, the interest in new technologies for wheat improvement has 
      increased greatly. To screen genetically modified germplasm in conditions more 
      realistic for a field situation we developed a phenotyping platform where 
      transgenic wheat and barley are grown in competition. In this study, we used the 
      platform to (1) test selected promoter and gene combinations for their capacity 
      to increase drought tolerance, (2) test the function and power of our platform to 
      screen the performance of transgenic plants growing in competition, and (3) 
      develop and test an imaging and analysis process as a means of obtaining 
      additional, non-destructive data on plant growth throughout the whole growth 
      cycle instead of relying solely on destructive sampling at the end of the season. 
      The results showed that several transgenic lines under well watered conditions 
      had higher biomass and/or grain weight than the wild-type control but the 
      advantage was significant in one case only. None of the transgenics seemed to 
      show any grain weight advantage under drought stress and only two lines had a 
      substantially but not significantly higher biomass weight than the wild type. 
      However, their evaluation under drought stress was disadvantaged by their delayed 
      flowering date, which increased the drought stress they experienced in comparison 
      to the wild type. Continuous imaging during the season provided additional and 
      non-destructive phenotyping information on the canopy development of mini-plots 
      in our phenotyping platform. A correlation analysis of daily canopy coverage data 
      with harvest metrics showed that the best predictive value from canopy coverage 
      data for harvest metrics was achieved with observations from around 
      heading/flowering to early ripening whereas early season observations had only a 
      limited diagnostic value. The result that the biomass/leaf development in the 
      early growth phase has little correlation with biomass or grain yield data 
      questions imaging approaches concentrating only on the early development stage.

TI  - Maternal sepsis in the era of genomic medicine.
PG  - 49-60
LID - 10.1007/s00404-017-4584-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Maternal sepsis remains one of the leading causes of direct and indirect 
      maternal mortality both in high- and low-income environments. In the last two 
      decades, systems biology approaches, based on '-omics' technologies, have started 
      revolutionizing the diagnosis and management of the septic syndrome. The scope of 
      this narrative review is to present an overview of the basic '-omics' 
      technologies, exemplified by cases relevant to maternal sepsis. METHODS: 
      Narrative review of the new '-omics' technologies based on a detailed review of 
      the literature. RESULTS: After presenting the main 'omics' technologies, we 
      discuss their limitations and the need for integrated approaches that encompass 
      research efforts across multiple '-omics' layers in the '-omics' cascade between 
      the genome and the phenome. CONCLUSIONS: Systems biology approaches are 
      revolutionizing the research landscape in maternal sepsis. There is a need for 
      increased awareness, from the side of health practitioners, as a requirement for 
      the effective implementation of the new technologies in the research and clinical 
      practice in maternal sepsis.

TI  - Understanding the Genetic Landscape of Small Cell Carcinoma of the Urinary 
      Bladder and Implications for Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment: A Review.
PG  - 1570-1578
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.7013 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder is a rare and aggressive 
      neuroendocrine tumor of the urinary bladder. Although research has been performed 
      since the first case was reported in 1981, most of our understanding of the 
      disease treatments has been extrapolated from small cell carcinoma of the lung. 
      However, current data on patient survival have been stagnant. OBSERVATIONS: With 
      the advent of advanced molecular diagnostic methods, a new potential for 
      understanding the origin and treatment of small cell carcinoma of the urinary 
      bladder has become evident. Similar to published studies of small cell carcinoma 
      of the lung, collaborative efforts and accessible genome-phenome databases have 
      partially elucidated the genomic landscape. With these efforts, additional 
      potential areas of treatment, such as targeting driver mutations, immunotherapy, 
      stem cell modulation, and novel drug candidates, have been identified. Moreover, 
      identification of novel biomarkers and improved radiological methods may 
      complement our understanding of the course of disease relative to diagnosis, 
      staging, prognosis, and response to treatment. Such early discoveries have been 
      facilitated with novel animal-based models. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The 
      direction of investigation of small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder using 
      novel methods to understand the genomic landscape for new treatments remains 
      preliminary. However, such studies are maturing and may foster clinical research, 
      with opportunities to enhance the survival and health-related quality of life of 
      individuals with this disease.

TI  - AHCODA-DB: a data repository with web-based mining tools for the analysis of 
      automated high-content mouse phenomics data.
PG  - 200
LID - 10.1186/s12859-017-1612-1 [doi]
LID - 200
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematic, standardized and in-depth phenotyping and data analyses 
      of rodent behaviour empowers gene-function studies, drug testing and therapy 
      design. However, no data repositories are currently available for standardized 
      quality control, data analysis and mining at the resolution of individual mice. 
      DESCRIPTION: Here, we present AHCODA-DB, a public data repository with 
      standardized quality control and exclusion criteria aimed to enhance robustness 
      of data, enabled with web-based mining tools for the analysis of individually and 
      group-wise collected mouse phenotypic data. AHCODA-DB allows monitoring in vivo 
      effects of compounds collected from conventional behavioural tests and from 
      automated home-cage experiments assessing spontaneous behaviour, anxiety and 
      cognition without human interference. AHCODA-DB includes such data from mutant 
      mice (transgenics, knock-out, knock-in), (recombinant) inbred strains, and 
      compound effects in wildtype mice and disease models. AHCODA-DB provides real 
      time statistical analyses with single mouse resolution and versatile suite of 
      data presentation tools. On March 9th, 2017 AHCODA-DB contained 650 k data points 
      on 2419 parameters from 1563 mice. CONCLUSION: AHCODA-DB provides users with 
      tools to systematically explore mouse behavioural data, both with positive and 
      negative outcome, published and unpublished, across time and experiments with 
      single mouse resolution. The standardized (automated) experimental settings and 
      the large current dataset (1563 mice) in AHCODA-DB provide a unique framework for 
      the interpretation of behavioural data and drug effects. The use of common 
      ontologies allows data export to other databases such as the Mouse Phenome 
      Database. Unbiased presentation of positive and negative data obtained under the 
      highly standardized screening conditions increase cost efficiency of publicly 
      funded mouse screening projects and help to reach consensus conclusions on drug 
      responses and mouse behavioural phenotypes. The website is publicly accessible 
      through https://public.sylics.com and can be viewed in every recent version of 
      all commonly used browsers.

TI  - Genetic analysis in UK Biobank links insulin resistance and transendothelial 
      migration pathways to coronary artery disease.
PG  - 1392-1397
LID - 10.1038/ng.3914 [doi]
AB  - UK Biobank is among the world's largest repositories for phenotypic and genotypic 
      information in individuals of European ancestry. We performed a genome-wide 
      association study in UK Biobank testing ∼9 million DNA sequence variants for 
      association with coronary artery disease (4,831 cases and 115,455 controls) and 
      carried out meta-analysis with previously published results. We identified 15 new 
      loci, bringing the total number of loci associated with coronary artery disease 
      to 95 at the time of analysis. Phenome-wide association scanning showed that 
      CCDC92 likely affects coronary artery disease through insulin resistance 
      pathways, whereas experimental analysis suggests that ARHGEF26 influences the 
      transendothelial migration of leukocytes.

TI  - Genetic Analysis of Venous Thromboembolism in UK Biobank Identifies the ZFPM2 
      Locus and Implicates Obesity as a Causal Risk Factor.
LID - 10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.116.001643 [doi]
LID - e001643
AB  - BACKGROUND: UK Biobank is the world's largest repository for phenotypic and 
      genotypic information for individuals of European ancestry. Here, we leverage UK 
      Biobank to understand the inherited basis for venous thromboembolism (VTE), a 
      leading cause of cardiovascular mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 
      3290 VTE cases and 116 868 controls through billing code-based phenotyping. We 
      performed a genome-wide association study for VTE with ≈9 000 000 imputed 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We performed a phenome-wide association study 
      for a genetic risk score of 10 VTE-associated variants. To assess whether obesity 
      is a causal factor for VTE, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis using a 
      genetic risk score instrument composed of 68 body mass index-associated variants. 
      The genome-wide association study for VTE replicated previous findings at the F5, 
      F2, ABO, F11, and FGG loci. We identified 1 new locus-ZFPM2 rs4602861-at 
      genome-wide significance (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.15; 
      P=4.9×10(-10)) and a new independent variant at the F2 locus (rs3136516; odds 
      ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.13; P=7.60×10(-9)). In a 
      phenome-wide association study, a 10 single-nucleotide polymorphism VTE genetic 
      risk score was associated with coronary artery disease (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% 
      confidence interval, 1.05-1.10 per unit increase in VTE odds; P=1.08×10(-9)). In 
      a Mendelian randomization analysis, genetically elevated body mass index (a 1 SD 
      increase) was associated with 57% higher risk of VTE (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% 
      confidence interval, 1.08-1.97; P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: For common diseases such 
      as VTE, biobanks provide potential to perform genetic discovery, explore the 
      phenotypic consequences for disease-associated variants, and test causal 
      inference.

AB  - Technology utilizing human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) has 
      enormous potential to provide improved cellular models of human disease. However, 
      variable genetic and phenotypic characterization of many existing iPS cell lines 
      limits their potential use for research and therapy. Here we describe the 
      systematic generation, genotyping and phenotyping of 711 iPS cell lines derived 
      from 301 healthy individuals by the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells 
      Initiative. Our study outlines the major sources of genetic and phenotypic 
      variation in iPS cells and establishes their suitability as models of complex 
      human traits and cancer. Through genome-wide profiling we find that 5-46% of the 
      variation in different iPS cell phenotypes, including differentiation capacity 
      and cellular morphology, arises from differences between individuals. 
      Additionally, we assess the phenotypic consequences of genomic copy-number 
      alterations that are repeatedly observed in iPS cells. In addition, we present a 
      comprehensive map of common regulatory variants affecting the transcriptome of 
      human pluripotent cells.

TI  - Genome-wide association mapping for phenotypic plasticity in rice.
PG  - 1565-1575
LID - 10.1111/pce.12955 [doi]
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity of plants in response to environmental changes is important 
      for adapting to changing climate. Less attention has been paid to exploring the 
      advantages of phenotypic plasticity in resource-rich environments to enhance the 
      productivity of agricultural crops. Here, we examined genetic variation for 
      phenotypic plasticity in indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) across two diverse panels: 
      (1) a Phenomics of Rice Adaptation and Yield (PRAY) population comprising 301 
      accessions; and (2) a Multi-parent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) indica 
      population comprising 151 accessions. Altered planting density was used as a 
      proxy for elevated atmospheric CO(2) response. Low planting density significantly 
      increased panicle weight per plant compared with normal density, and the 
      magnitude of the increase ranged from 1.10 to 2.78 times among accessions for the 
      PRAY population and from 1.05 to 2.45 times for the MAGIC population. 
      Genome-wide-association studies validate three Environmental Responsiveness (ER) 
      candidate alleles (qER1-3) that were associated with relative response of panicle 
      weight to low density. Two of these alleles were tested in 13 genotypes to 
      clarify their biomass responses during vegetative growth under elevated CO(2) in 
      Japan. Our study provides evidence for polymorphisms that control rice phenotypic 
      plasticity in environments that are rich in resources such as light and CO(2) .

AB  - In recent years, interest in studies of traditional medicine in Asian and African 
      countries has gradually increased due to its potential to complement modern 
      medicine. In this review, we provide an overview of Thai traditional medicine 
      (TTM) current development, and ongoing research activities of TTM related to 
      metabolomics. This review will also focus on three important elements of systems 
      biology analysis of TTM including analytical techniques, statistical approaches 
      and bioinformatics tools for handling and analyzing untargeted metabolomics data. 
      The main objective of this data analysis is to gain a comprehensive understanding 
      of the system wide effects that TTM has on individuals. Furthermore, potential 
      applications of metabolomics and systems medicine in TTM will also be discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) (C342Y/+) mutation is a 
      known cause of Crouzon syndrome that is characterised by craniosynostosis and 
      midfacial hypoplasia. Our aim was to conduct extensive phenotyping of the 
      maxillary, mandibular and dental morphology associated with this mutation. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Morphometric data were obtained from 40 mice, representing 
      two genotypes (Crouzon and wild-type) and two sexes (males and females) (n=10 in 
      each group). Dental analysis further categorised the first molars into the two 
      jaws (maxillary and mandibular) (n=20 in each group). Maxillary, mandibular and 
      dental morphology was compared by analysing 23 linear landmark-based dimensions 
      in three-dimensional micro-computed tomography reconstructions. RESULTS: Compared 
      with wild-type, Crouzon (FGFR2(C342Y/+)) maxillae were significantly shorter in 
      maximum height, anterior and posterior lengths and middle width, but larger in 
      posterior width (p<0.05 for height; p<0.001 for other comparisons). In the 
      Crouzon mandible, the ascending and descending heights, effective and mandibular 
      lengths, and intercoronoid and intercondylar widths were significantly shorter, 
      whereas intergonial width was larger (p<0.01 for intercondylar width; p<0.001 for 
      other comparisons). Crouzon teeth were significantly smaller mesiodistally, but 
      larger in crown height (p<0.001 for each comparison). All Crouzon mice presented 
      with bifid mandibular condyles and a quarter presented with expansive bone 
      lesions in the mandibular incisor alveolus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of 
      hypoplasia in all three planes in Crouzon maxillae and mandibles, together with 
      the presence of bifid mandibular condyles and expansive bone lesions, may be 
      relevant to maxillofacial surgery and orthodontics. Beyond skeletal effects, the 
      FGFR2(C342Y/+) mutation is now implicated in affecting tooth development. This 
      study's skeletal phenomics data also provides baseline data against which the 
      effect of various treatments can now be assessed.

TI  - Phenome-wide scanning identifies multiple diseases and disease severity 
      phenotypes associated with HLA variants.
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.aai8708 [doi]
LID - eaai8708
AB  - Although many phenotypes have been associated with variants in human leukocyte 
      antigen (HLA) genes, the full phenotypic impact of HLA variants across all 
      diseases is unknown. We imputed HLA genomic variation from two populations of 
      28,839 and 8431 European ancestry individuals and tested association of HLA 
      variation with 1368 phenotypes. A total of 104 four-digit and 92 two-digit HLA 
      allele phenotype associations were significant in both discovery and replication 
      cohorts, the strongest being HLA-DQB1*03:02 and type 1 diabetes. Four previously 
      unidentified associations were identified across the spectrum of disease with 
      two- and four-digit HLA alleles and 10 with nonsynonymous variants. Some 
      conditions associated with multiple HLA variants and stronger associations with 
      more severe disease manifestations were identified. A comprehensive, publicly 
      available catalog of clinical phenotypes associated with HLA variation is 
      provided. Examining HLA variant disease associations in this large data set 
      allows comprehensive definition of disease associations to drive further 
      mechanistic insights.

TI  - Culturomics: A New Kid on the Block of OMICS to Enable Personalized Medicine.
PG  - 108-118
LID - 10.1089/omi.2017.0017 [doi]
AB  - This innovation analysis highlights the underestimated and versatile potential of 
      the new field of culturomics and examines its relation to other OMICS system 
      sciences such as infectiomics, metabolomics, phenomics, and pharmacomicrobiomics. 
      The advent of molecular biology, followed by the emergence of various disciplines 
      of the genomics, and most importantly metagenomics, brought about the sharp 
      decline of conventional microbiology methods. Emergence of culturomics has a 
      natural synergy with therapeutic and clinical genomic approaches so as to realize 
      personalized medicine. Notably, the concept of culturomics expands on that of 
      phenomics and allows a reintroduction of the culture-based phenotypic 
      characterization into the 21st century research repertoire, bolstered by robust 
      technology for automated and massive execution, but its potential is largely 
      unappreciated at present; the few available references show unenthusiastic 
      pursuit and in narrow applications. This has not to be so: depending on the 
      specific brand of culturomics, the scope of applications may extend to medicine, 
      agriculture, environmental sciences, pharmacomicrobiomics, and biotechnology 
      innovation. Moreover, culturomics may produce Big Data. This calls for a new 
      generation of data scientists and innovative ways of harnessing and valorizing 
      Big Data beyond classical genomics. Much more detailed and objective 
      classification and identification of microbiota may soon be at hand through 
      culturomics, thus enabling precision diagnosis toward truly personalized 
      medicine. Culturomics may both widen the scope of microbiology and improve its 
      contributions to diagnostics and personalized medicine, characterizing microbes 
      and determining their associations with health and disease dynamics.

AB  - Plant phenomics offers unique opportunities to accelerate our understanding of 
      gene function and plant response to different environments, and may be 
      particularly useful for studying previously uncharacterized genes. One important 
      type of poorly characterized genes is those derived from transposable elements 
      (TEs), which have departed from a mobility-driven lifestyle to attain new 
      adaptive roles for the host (exapted TEs). We used phenomics approaches, coupled 
      with reverse genetics, to analyze T-DNA insertion mutants of both previously 
      reported and novel protein-coding exapted TEs in the model plant Arabidopsis 
      thaliana. We show that mutations in most of these exapted TEs result in 
      phenotypes, particularly when challenged by abiotic stress. We built statistical 
      multi-dimensional phenotypic profiles and compared them to wild-type and known 
      stress responsive mutant lines for each particular stress condition. We found 
      that these exapted TEs may play roles in responses to phosphate limitation, 
      tolerance to high salt concentration, freezing temperatures, and arsenic 
      toxicity. These results not only experimentally validate a large set of putative 
      functional exapted TEs recently discovered through computational analysis, but 
      also uncover additional novel phenotypes for previously well-characterized 
      exapted TEs in A. thaliana.

TI  - World Endometriosis Society consensus on the classification of endometriosis.
PG  - 315-324
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dew293 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: What is the global consensus on the classification of 
      endometriosis that considers the views of women with endometriosis? SUMMARY 
      ANSWER: We have produced an international consensus statement on the 
      classification of endometriosis through systematic appraisal of evidence and a 
      consensus process that included representatives of national and international, 
      medical and non-medical societies, patient organizations, and companies with an 
      interest in endometriosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Classification systems of 
      endometriosis, developed by several professional organizations, traditionally 
      have been based on lesion appearance, pelvic adhesions, and anatomic location of 
      disease. One system predicts fertility outcome and none predicts pelvic pain, 
      response to medications, disease recurrence, risks for associated disorders, 
      quality of life measures, and other endpoints important to women and health care 
      providers for guiding appropriate therapeutic options and prognosis. STUDY 
      DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A consensus meeting, in conjunction with pre- and 
      post-meeting processes, was undertaken. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: 
      A consensus meeting was held on 30 April 2014 in conjunction with the World 
      Endometriosis Society's 12th World Congress on Endometriosis. Rigorous pre- and 
      post-meeting processes, involving 55 representatives of 29 national and 
      international, medical and non-medical organizations from a range of disciplines, 
      led to this consensus statement. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 
      28 consensus statements were made. Of all, 10 statements had unanimous consensus, 
      however none of the statements was made without expression of a caveat about the 
      strength of the statement or the statement itself. Two statements did not achieve 
      majority consensus. The statements covered women's priorities, aspects of 
      classification, impact of low resources, as well as all the major classification 
      systems for endometriosis. Until better classification systems are developed, we 
      propose a classification toolbox (that includes the revised American Society for 
      Reproductive Medicine and, where appropriate, the Enzian and Endometriosis 
      Fertility Index staging systems), that may be used by all surgeons in each case 
      of surgery undertaken for women with endometriosis. We also propose wider use of 
      the World Endometriosis Research Foundation Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking 
      Harmonisation Project surgical and clinical data collection tools for research to 
      improve classification of endometriosis in the future, of particular relevance 
      when surgery is not undertaken. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This consensus 
      process differed from that of formal guideline development, although based on the 
      same available evidence. A different group of international experts from those 
      participating in this process may have yielded subtly different consensus 
      statements. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first time that a 
      large, global, consortium-representing 29 major stake-holding organizations, from 
      19 countries - has convened to systematically evaluate the best available 
      evidence on the classification of endometriosis and reach consensus. In addition 
      to 21 international medical organizations and companies, representatives from 
      eight national endometriosis organizations were involved, including lay support 
      groups, thus generating and including input from women who suffer from 
      endometriosis in an endeavour to keep uppermost the goal of optimizing quality of 
      life for women with endometriosis. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The World 
      Endometriosis Society convened and hosted the consensus meeting. Financial 
      support for participants to attend the meeting was provided by the organizations 
      that they represented. There was no other specific funding for this consensus 
      process. Mauricio Abrao is an advisor to Bayer Pharma, and a consultant to AbbVie

TI  - Global Functional Analysis of Butanol-Sensitive Escherichia coli and Its Evolved 
      Butanol-Tolerant Strain.
PG  - 1171-1179
LID - 10.4014/jmb.1702.02021 [doi]
AB  - Butanol is a promising alternative to ethanol and is desirable for use in 
      transportation fuels and additives to gasoline and diesel fuels. Microbial 
      production of butanol is challenging primarily because of its toxicity and low 
      titer of production. Herein, we compared the transcriptome and phenome of 
      wild-type Escherichia coli and its butanol-tolerant evolved strain to understand 
      the global cellular physiology and metabolism responsible for butanol tolerance. 
      When the ancestral butanol-sensitive E. coli was exposed to butanol, gene 
      activities involved in respiratory mechanisms and oxidative stress were highly 
      perturbed. Intriguingly, the evolved butanol-tolerant strain behaved similarly in 
      both the absence and presence of butanol. Among the mutations occurring in the 
      evolved strain, cis-regulatory mutations may be the cause of butanol tolerance. 
      This study provides a foundation for the rational design of the metabolic and 
      regulatory pathways for enhanced biofuel production.

TI  - The Diagnosis-Wide Landscape of Hospital-Acquired AKI.
PG  - 874-884
LID - 10.2215/CJN.10981016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The exploration of electronic hospital records offers 
      a unique opportunity to describe in-depth the prevalence of conditions associated 
      with diagnoses at an unprecedented level of comprehensiveness. We used a 
      diagnosis-wide approach, adapted from phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), 
      to perform an exhaustive analysis of all diagnoses associated with 
      hospital-acquired AKI (HA-AKI) in a French urban tertiary academic hospital over 
      a period of 10 years. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We 
      retrospectively extracted all diagnoses from an i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating 
      Biology and the Bedside) clinical data warehouse for patients who stayed in this 
      hospital between 2006 and 2015 and had at least two plasma creatinine 
      measurements performed during the first week of their stay. We then analyzed the 
      association between HA-AKI and each International Classification of Diseases 
      (ICD)-10 diagnostic category to draw a comprehensive picture of diagnoses 
      associated with AKI. Hospital stays for 126,736 unique individuals were 
      extracted. RESULTS: Hemodynamic impairment and surgical procedures are the main 
      factors associated with HA-AKI and five clusters of diagnoses were identified: 
      sepsis, heart diseases, polytrauma, liver disease, and cardiovascular surgery. 
      The ICD-10 code corresponding to AKI (N17) was recorded in 30% of the cases with 
      HA-AKI identified, and in this situation, 20% of the diagnoses associated with 
      HA-AKI corresponded to kidney diseases such as tubulointerstitial nephritis, 
      necrotizing vasculitis, or myeloma cast nephropathy. Codes associated with HA-AKI 
      that demonstrated the greatest increase in prevalence with time were related to 
      influenza, polytrauma, and surgery of neoplasms of the genitourinary system. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our approach, derived from PheWAS, is a valuable way to 
      comprehensively identify and classify all of the diagnoses and clusters of 
      diagnoses associated with HA-AKI. Our analysis delivers insights into how 
      diagnoses associated with HA-AKI evolved over time. On the basis of ICD-10 codes, 
      HA-AKI appears largely underestimated in this academic hospital.

AB  - We present here results of a theoretical investigation of particle transport in 
      longitudinally asymmetric but axially symmetric capillaries, allowing for the 
      influence of both diffusion and convection. In this study we have focused 
      attention primarily on characterizing the influence of tube geometry and applied 
      hydraulic pressure on the magnitude, direction and rate of transport of particles 
      in axi-symmetric, saw-tooth shaped tubes. Three initial value problems are 
      considered. The first involves the evolution of a fixed number of particles 
      initially confined to a central wave-section. The second involves the evolution 
      of the same initial state but including an ongoing production of particles in the 
      central wave-section. The third involves the evolution of particles a fully laden 
      tube. Based on a physical model of convective-diffusive transport, assuming an 
      underlying oscillatory fluid velocity field that is unaffected by the presence of 
      the particles, we find that transport rates and even net transport directions 
      depend critically on the design specifics, such as tube geometry, flow rate, 
      initial particle configuration and whether or not particles are continuously 
      introduced. The second transient scenario is qualitatively independent of the 
      details of how particles are generated. In the third scenario there is no net 
      transport. As the study is fundamental in nature, our findings could engender 
      greater understanding of practical systems.

TI  - A Small Cohort Omega-3 PUFA Supplement Study: Implications of Stratifying 
      According to Lipid Membrane Incorporation in Cardiac Surgical Patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies and randomised clinical trials (RCTs) report 
      disparate findings in relation to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) 
      benefit for cardiac patients. With RCTs interpretation is potentially confounded 
      by background n-3 PUFA intake. The goal of this pilot, small cohort, pre-surgical 
      supplementation study was to evaluate postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) and 
      cardiac molecular expression profiles employing two data analysis approaches - by 
      treatment randomisation and by stratification using measured n-3 PUFA. METHODS: 
      Patients (n=20) received 3g/day of fish or placebo oil (FO vs PO) in a double 
      blind randomised protocol prior to elective coronary artery graft and valve 
      surgery. Groups were matched for age, gender, and mean treatment duration (∼20 
      days). Resected atrial myocardium was sampled for assay of viability metabolic 
      markers, and blood obtained for erythrocyte membrane lipid measurement. RESULTS: 
      There was substantial overlap of cell membrane n-3 PUFA content across PO and FO 
      groups, and no group treatment effects on AF incidence or myocardial molecular 
      marker levels were detected. In contrast, data stratification using membrane n-3 
      PUFA content (at 8% total membrane lipid) achieved significant separation of 
      patients (by n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio), a significant differential cardiac expression 
      of the marker peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor, but no difference in 
      AF incidence. CONCLUSIONS: This small n-3 PUFA case study demonstrates that the 
      same cohort may yield differing findings when evaluated using randomisation or 
      stratification approaches based on direct molecular measures in cell membranes.

AB  - Phenomics, which ideally involves in-depth phenotyping at the whole-organism 
      scale, may enhance our functional understanding of genetic variation. Here, we 
      demonstrate methods to profile hundreds of phenotypic measures comprised of 
      morphological and densitometric traits at a large number of sites within the 
      axial skeleton of adult zebrafish. We show the potential for vertebral patterns 
      to confer heightened sensitivity, with similar specificity, in discriminating 
      mutant populations compared to analyzing individual vertebrae in isolation. We 
      identify phenotypes associated with human brittle bone disease and thyroid 
      stimulating hormone receptor hyperactivity. Finally, we develop allometric models 
      and show their potential to aid in the discrimination of mutant phenotypes masked 
      by alterations in growth. Our studies demonstrate virtues of deep phenotyping in 
      a spatially distributed organ system. Analyzing phenotypic patterns may increase 
      productivity in genetic screens, and facilitate the study of genetic variants 
      associated with smaller effect sizes, such as those that underlie complex 
      diseases.

AB  - Head motion reduces data quality of neuroimaging data. In three functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments we demonstrate that people make less 
      head movements under task than resting-state conditions. In Experiment 1, we 
      observed less head motion during a memory encoding task than during the 
      resting-state condition. In Experiment 2, using publicly shared data from the 
      UCLA Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics LA5c Study, we again found less 
      head motion during several active task conditions than during a resting-state 
      condition, although some task conditions also showed comparable motion. In the 
      healthy controls, we found more head motion in men than in women and more motion 
      with increasing age. When comparing clinical groups, we found that patients with 
      a clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia, move more compared to 
      healthy controls or patients with ADHD. Both these experiments had a fixed 
      acquisition order across participants, and we could not rule out that a first or 
      last scan during a session might be particularly prone to more head motion. 
      Therefore, we conducted Experiment 3, in which we collected several task and 
      resting-state fMRI runs with an acquisition order counter-balanced. The results 
      of Experiment 3 show again less head motion during several task conditions than 
      during rest. Together these experiments demonstrate that small head motions occur 
      during MRI even with careful instruction to remain still and fixation with foam 
      pillows, but that head motion is lower when participants are engaged in a 
      cognitive task. These finding may inform the choice of functional runs when 
      studying difficult-to-scan populations, such as children or certain patient 
      populations. Our findings also indicate that differences in head motion 
      complicate direct comparisons of measures of functional neuronal networks between 
      task and resting-state fMRI because of potential differences in data quality. In 
      practice, a task to reduce head motion might be especially useful when acquiring 
      structural MRI data such as T1/T2-weighted and diffusion MRI in research and 
      clinical settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wheat is one of the most widely grown crop in temperate climates for 
      food and animal feed. In order to meet the demands of the predicted population 
      increase in an ever-changing climate, wheat production needs to dramatically 
      increase. Spike and grain traits are critical determinants of final yield and 
      grain uniformity a commercially desired trait, but their analysis is laborious 
      and often requires destructive harvest. One of the current challenges is to 
      develop an accurate, non-destructive method for spike and grain trait analysis 
      capable of handling large populations. RESULTS: In this study we describe the 
      development of a robust method for the accurate extraction and measurement of 
      spike and grain morphometric parameters from images acquired by X-ray 
      micro-computed tomography (μCT). The image analysis pipeline developed 
      automatically identifies plant material of interest in μCT images, performs image 
      analysis, and extracts morphometric data. As a proof of principle, this 
      integrated methodology was used to analyse the spikes from a population of wheat 
      plants subjected to high temperatures under two different water regimes. 
      Temperature has a negative effect on spike height and grain number with the 
      middle of the spike being the most affected region. The data also confirmed that 
      increased grain volume was correlated with the decrease in grain number under 
      mild stress. CONCLUSIONS: Being able to quickly measure plant phenotypes in a 
      non-destructive manner is crucial to advance our understanding of gene function 
      and the effects of the environment. We report on the development of an image 
      analysis pipeline capable of accurately and reliably extracting spike and grain 
      traits from crops without the loss of positional information. This methodology 
      was applied to the analysis of wheat spikes can be readily applied to other 
      economically important crop species.

TI  - A Review of Computational Drug Repositioning Approaches.
LID - 10.2174/1386207321666171221112835 [doi]
AB  - Computational drug repositioning emerges as a new idea of drug discovery and 
      development. Contrary to conventional routines, computational drug repositioning 
      encompasses low risk and high safety. Some successful cases demonstrated its 
      advantage. Therefore, a large number of computational drug repositioning 
      approaches have been developed over the past decades. We summarized briefly these 
      methods and classified them into target-based, gene-expression-based, 
      phenome-based and multi-omics-based categories according to strategies of drug 
      repositioning. We reviewed some representatives of computational drug 
      repositioning methods in each category, with emphasis on detail of techniques and 
      finally discussed developing trends of computational drug repositioning.

AB  - To study the physiological roles of NADH and NADPH homeostasis in cancer, we 
      studied the effect of NNT knockdown on physiology of SK-Hep1 cells. NNT knockdown 
      cells show limited abilities to maintain NAD(+) and NADPH levels and have reduced 
      proliferation and tumorigenicity. There is an increased dependence of energy 
      production on oxidative phosphorylation. Studies with stable isotope tracers have 
      revealed that under the new steady-state metabolic condition, the fluxes of TCA 
      and glycolysis decrease while that of reductive carboxylation increases. 
      Increased [α-ketoglutarate]/[succinate] ratio in NNT-deficient cells results in 
      decrease in HIF-1α level and expression of HIF-1α regulated genes. Reduction in 
      NADPH level leads to repression of HDAC1 activity and an increase in p53 
      acetylation. These findings suggest that NNT is essential to homeostasis of NADH 
      and NADPH pools, anomalies of which affect HIF-1α- and HDAC1-dependent pathways, 
      and hence retrograde response of mitochondria.

AB  - The NIH/NHLBI launched an initiative, “Redefining Pulmonary Hypertension through 
      Pulmonary Vascular Disease Phenomics (PVDOMICS)” that aims to augment the current 
      PH classification based on shared biological features. PVDOMICS will enroll 1,500 
      participants with PH and disease and healthy comparators. Enrollees will undergo 
      deep clinical phenotyping and blood will be acquired for comprehensive “omic” 
      analyses that will focus on discovery of molecular-based subtypes of PVD through 
      application of high dimensional model-based clustering methods. In addition to an 
      updated, molecular classification of PVD, the phenomic data generated will be a 
      rich resource to the broad community of heart and lung disease investigators.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Resting metabolic rates (RMR) vary across individuals. Understanding 
      the determinants of RMR could provide biological insight into obesity and its 
      metabolic consequences such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. 
      METHODS: The present study measured RMR using reference standard indirect 
      calorimetry and evaluated genetic variations from an exome array in a sample of 
      children and adults (N = 262) predominantly of African and European ancestry with 
      a wide range of ages (10 - 67 years old) and body mass indices (BMI; 16.9 - 
      56.3 kg/m(2) for adults, 15.1 - 40.6 kg/m2 for children). RESULTS: Single variant 
      analysis for RMR identified suggestive loci on chromosomes 15 (rs74010762, TRPM1, 
      p-value = 2.7 × 10-6), 1 (rs2358728 and rs2358729, SH3D21, p-values < 5.8x10-5), 
      17 (AX-82990792, DHX33, 5.5 × 10-5) and 5 (rs115795863 and rs35433829, C5orf33 
      and RANBP3L, p-values < 8.2 × 10-5). To evaluate the effect of low frequency 
      variations with RMR, we performed gene-based association tests. Our most 
      significant locus was SH3D21 (p-value 2.01 × 10-4), which also contained 
      suggestive results from single-variant analyses. A further investigation of all 
      variants within the reported genes for all obesity-related loci from the GWAS 
      catalog found nominal evidence for association of body mass index (BMI- 
      kg/m(2))-associated loci with RMR, with the most significant p-value at 
      rs35433754 (TNKS, p-value = 0.0017). CONCLUSIONS: These nominal associations were 
      robust to adjustment for BMI. The most significant variants were also evaluated 
      using phenome-wide association to evaluate pleiotropy, and genetically predicted 
      gene expression using the summary statistics implicated loci related to in 
      obesity and body composition. These results merit further examination in larger 
      cohorts of children and adults.

TI  - A new genus of horse from Pleistocene North America.
LID - e29944 [pii]
LID - 10.7554/eLife.29944 [doi]
AB  - The extinct 'New World stilt-legged', or NWSL, equids constitute a perplexing 
      group of Pleistocene horses endemic to North America. Their slender distal limb 
      bones resemble those of Asiatic asses, such as the Persian onager. Previous 
      palaeogenetic studies, however, have suggested a closer relationship to caballine 
      horses than to Asiatic asses. Here, we report complete mitochondrial and partial 
      nuclear genomes from NWSL equids from across their geographic range. Although 
      multiple NWSL equid species have been named, our palaeogenomic and morphometric 
      analyses support the idea that there was only a single species of middle to late 
      Pleistocene NWSL equid, and demonstrate that it falls outside of crown group 
      Equus. We therefore propose a new genus, Haringtonhippus, for the sole species H. 
      francisci. Our combined genomic and phenomic approach to resolving the 
      systematics of extinct megafauna will allow for an improved understanding of the 
      full extent of the terminal Pleistocene extinction event.

AB  - Genome-wide, imputed, sequence, and structural data are now available for 
      exceedingly large sample sizes. The needs for data management, handling 
      population structure and related samples, and performing associations have 
      largely been met. However, the infrastructure to support analyses involving 
      complexity beyond genome-wide association studies is not standardized or 
      centralized. We provide the PLatform for the Analysis, Translation, and 
      Organization of large-scale data (PLATO), a software tool equipped to handle 
      multi-omic data for hundreds of thousands of samples to explore complexity using 
      genetic interactions, environment-wide association studies and gene-environment 
      interactions, phenome-wide association studies, as well as copy number and rare 
      variant analyses. Using the data from the Marshfield Personalized Medicine 
      Research Project, a site in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network, 
      we apply each feature of PLATO to type 2 diabetes and demonstrate how PLATO can 
      be used to uncover the complex etiology of common traits.

TI  - Adipose tissue and metabolic and inflammatory responses to stroke are altered in 
      obese mice.

LID - 10.1242/dmm.030411 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is an independent risk factor for stroke, although several clinical 
      studies have reported that obesity improves stroke outcome. Obesity is 
      hypothesised to aid recovery by protecting against post-stroke catabolism. We 
      therefore assessed whether obese mice had an altered metabolic and inflammatory 
      response to stroke. Obese ob/ob mice underwent a 20-min middle cerebral artery 
      occlusion and 24-h reperfusion. Lipid metabolism and expression of inflammatory 
      cytokines were assessed in the plasma, liver and adipose tissue. The 
      obese-specific metabolic response to stroke was assessed in plasma using 
      non-targeted ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
      (UHPLC-MS) metabolomics coupled with univariate and multivariate analysis. 
      Obesity had no effect on the extent of weight loss 24 h after stroke but affected 
      the metabolic and inflammatory responses to stroke, predominantly affecting lipid 
      metabolism. Specifically, obese mice had increases in plasma free fatty acids and 
      expression of adipose lipolytic enzymes. Metabolomics identified several classes 
      of metabolites affected by stroke in obese mice, including fatty acids and 
      membrane lipids (glycerophospholipids, lysophospholipids and sphingolipids). 
      Obesity also featured increases in inflammatory cytokines in the plasma and 
      adipose tissue. Overall, these results demonstrate that obesity affected the 
      acute metabolic and inflammatory response to stroke and suggest a potential role 
      for adipose tissue in this effect. These findings could have implications for 
      longer-term recovery and also further highlight the importance of considering 
      comorbidities in preclinical stroke research, especially when identifying 
      biomarkers for stroke. However, further work is required to assess whether these 
      changes translate into long-term effects on recovery.

AB  - The integration of different sources of biological information about what defines 
      a behavioral phenotype is difficult to unify in an entity that reflects the 
      arithmetic sum of its individual parts. In this sense, the challenge of Systems 
      Biology for understanding the "psychiatric phenotype" is to provide an improved 
      vision of the shape of the phenotype as it is visualized by "Gestalt" psychology, 
      whose fundamental axiom is that the observed phenotype (behavior or mental 
      disorder) will be the result of the integrative composition of every part. 
      Therefore, we propose the term "Gestaltomics" as a term from Systems Biology to 
      integrate data coming from different sources of information (such as the genome, 
      transcriptome, proteome, epigenome, metabolome, phenome, and microbiome). In 
      addition to this biological complexity, the mind is integrated through multiple 
      brain functions that receive and process complex information through channels and 
      perception networks (i.e., sight, ear, smell, memory, and attention) that in turn 
      are programmed by genes and influenced by environmental processes (epigenetic). 
      Today, the approach of medical research in human diseases is to isolate one 
      disease for study; however, the presence of an additional disease (co-morbidity) 
      or more than one disease (multimorbidity) adds complexity to the study of these 
      conditions. This review will present the challenge of integrating psychiatric 
      disorders at different levels of information (Gestaltomics). The implications of 
      increasing the level of complexity, for example, studying the co-morbidity with 
      another disease such as cancer, will also be discussed.

TI  - Finger Millet: A "Certain" Crop for an "Uncertain" Future and a Solution to Food 
      Insecurity and Hidden Hunger under Stressful Environments.
PG  - 643

AB  - Crop growth and productivity has largely been vulnerable to various abiotic and 
      biotic stresses that are only set to be compounded due to global climate change. 
      Therefore developing improved varieties and designing newer approaches for crop 
      improvement against stress tolerance have become a priority now-a-days. However, 
      most of the crop improvement strategies are directed toward staple cereals such 
      as rice, wheat, maize etc., whereas attention on minor cereals such as finger 
      millet [Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.] lags far behind. It is an important 
      staple in several semi-arid and tropical regions of the world with excellent 
      nutraceutical properties as well as ensuring food security in these areas even 
      during harsh environment. This review highlights the importance of finger millet 
      as a model nutraceutical crop. Progress and prospects in genetic manipulation for 
      the development of abiotic and biotic stress tolerant varieties is also 
      discussed. Although limited studies have been conducted for genetic improvement 
      of finger millets, its nutritional significance in providing minerals, calories 
      and protein makes it an ideal model for nutrition-agriculture research. 
      Therefore, improved genetic manipulation of finger millets for resistance to both 
      abiotic and biotic stresses, as well as for enhancing nutrient content will be 
      very effective in millet improvement. Key message: Apart from the excellent 
      nutraceutical value of finger millet, its ability to tolerate various abiotic 
      stresses and resist pathogens make it an excellent model for exploring vast 
      genetic and genomic potential of this crop, which provide us a wide choice for 
      developing strategies for making climate resilient staple crops.

TI  - EasyPCC: Benchmark Datasets and Tools for High-Throughput Measurement of the 
      Plant Canopy Coverage Ratio under Field Conditions.
LID - 10.3390/s17040798 [doi]
LID - 798
AB  - Understanding interactions of genotype, environment, and management under field 
      conditions is vital for selecting new cultivars and farming systems. Image 
      analysis is considered a robust technique in high-throughput phenotyping with 
      non-destructive sampling. However, analysis of digital field-derived images 
      remains challenging because of the variety of light intensities, growth 
      environments, and developmental stages. The plant canopy coverage (PCC) ratio is 
      an important index of crop growth and development. Here, we present a tool, 
      EasyPCC, for effective and accurate evaluation of the ground coverage ratio from 
      a large number of images under variable field conditions. The core algorithm of 
      EasyPCC is based on a pixel-based segmentation method using a decision-tree-based 
      segmentation model (DTSM). EasyPCC was developed under the MATLAB(®) and R 
      languages; thus, it could be implemented in high-performance computing to handle 
      large numbers of images following just a single model training process. This 
      study used an experimental set of images from a paddy field to demonstrate 
      EasyPCC, and to show the accuracy improvement possible by adjusting key points 
      (e.g., outlier deletion and model retraining). The accuracy (R² = 0.99) of the 
      calculated coverage ratio was validated against a corresponding benchmark 
      dataset. The EasyPCC source code is released under GPL license with benchmark 
      datasets of several different crop types for algorithm development and for 
      evaluating ground coverage ratios.

AB  - Peripheral vascular occlusive disease (PVOD) is a common manifestation of 
      atherosclerosis, and it has a high rate of morbidity. Therapeutic angiogenesis 
      would re-establish blood perfusion and rescue ischemic tissue. Vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces angiogenesis and can potentially be used 
      to treat ischemic diseases, yet in clinical trials VEGF has not fulfilled its 
      full potential with side effects. Whether amino acids promote angiogenesis and 
      the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we showed that (1) Glycine 
      significantly promoted angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo and effectively 
      protected mitochondrial function. (2) Activation of glycine transporter 1(GlyT1) 
      induced by VEGF led to an increase in intracellular glycine. (3) Glycine directly 
      bounded to voltage dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) on the mitochondrial outer 
      membrane and inhibited its opening. These original results highlight glycine as a 
      necessary mediator in VEGF signalling via the GlyT1-glycine-mTOR-VDAC1 axis 
      pathway. Therefore, the findings in this study are of significance providing new 
      mechanistic insights into angiogenesis and providing better understanding of 
      glycine function in angiogenesis, which may provide valuable information for 
      development of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of angiogenic vascular 
      disorders.

TI  - High-Speed Quantitative UPLC-MS Analysis of Multiple Amines in Human Plasma and 
      Serum via Precolumn Derivatization with 6-Aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl 
      Carbamate: Application to Acetaminophen-Induced Liver Failure.
PG  - 2478-2487
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04623 [doi]
AB  - A targeted reversed-phase gradient UPLC-MS/MS assay has been developed for the 
      quantification /monitoring of 66 amino acids and amino-containing compounds in 
      human plasma and serum using precolumn derivatization with 
      6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (AccQTag Ultra). Derivatization 
      of the target amines required minimal sample preparation and resulted in analytes 
      with excellent chromatographic and mass spectrometric detection properties. The 
      resulting method, which requires only 10 μL of sample, provides the reproducible 
      and robust separation of 66 analytes in 7.5 min, including baseline resolution of 
      isomers such as leucine and isoleucine. The assay has been validated for the 
      quantification of 33 amino compounds (predominantly amino acids) over a 
      concentration range from 2 to 20 and 800 μM. Intra- and interday accuracy of 
      between 0.05 and 15.6 and 0.78-13.7% and precision between 0.91 and 16.9% and 
      2.12-15.9% were obtained. A further 33 biogenic amines can be monitored in 
      samples for relative changes in concentration rather than quantification. 
      Application of the assay to samples derived from healthy controls and patients 
      suffering from acetaminophen (APAP, paracetamol)-induced acute liver failure 
      (ALF) showed significant differences in the amounts of aromatic and branched 
      chain amino acids between the groups as well as a number of other analytes, 
      including the novel observation of increased concentrations of sarcosine in ALF 
      patients. The properties of the developed assay, including short analysis time, 
      make it suitable for high-throughput targeted UPLC-ESI-MS/MS metabonomic analysis 
      in clinical and epidemiological environments.

AB  - Symbiotic effectiveness of rhizobitoxine (Rtx)-producing strains of 
      Bradyrhizobium spp. in soybean (cultivar NRC-37/Ahilya-4) under limited soil 
      moisture conditions was evaluated using phenomics tools such as infrared(IR) 
      thermal and visible imaging. Red, green and blue (RGB) colour pixels were 
      standardized to analyse a total of 1017 IR thermal and 692 visible images. Plants 
      inoculated with the Rtx-producing strains B. elkanii USDA-61 and USDA-94 and 
      successive inoculation by B. diazoefficiens USDA-110 resulted in cooler canopy 
      temperatures and increased canopy greenness. The results of the image analysis of 
      plants inoculated with Rtx-producing strains were correlated with effective 
      nodulation, improved photosynthesis, plant nitrogen status and yield parameters. 
      Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the reliability of the phenomics 
      approach over conventional destructive approaches in assessing the symbiotic 
      effectiveness of Bradyrhizobium strains in soybean plants under watered 
      (87.41-89.96%) and water-stressed (90.54-94.21%) conditions. Multivariate cluster 
      analysis (MCA) revealed two distinct clusters denoting effective (Rtx) and 
      ineffective (non-Rtx) Bradyrhizobium inoculation treatments in soybean. 
      Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that this phenotyping approach is a 
      dependable alternative for screening drought tolerant genotypes or drought 
      resilience symbiosis. This is the first report on the application of non-invasive 
      phenomics techniques, particularly RGB-based image analysis, in assessing 
      plant-microbe symbiotic interactions to impart abiotic stress tolerance.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer related death 
      worldwide. Furthermore, with more than 1.2 million cases registered per year, it 
      constitutes the third most frequent diagnosed cancer entity worldwide. 
      Deregulation of protein synthesis has received considerable attention as a major 
      step in cancer development and progression. Eukaryotic translation initiation 
      factors (eIFs) are involved in the regulation of protein synthesis and are 
      functionally linked to the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian 
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. The identification of factors 
      accounting for colorectal carcinoma (CRC) development is a major gap in the 
      field. Besides the importance of eIF3 subunits and the eIF4 complex, eIF1, eIF5 
      and eIF6 were found to be altered in primary and metastatic CRC. We observed 
      significant difference in the expression profile between low and high grade CRC. 
      eIF1, eIF5 and eIF6 are involved in translational control in CRC. Our findings 
      also indicate a probable clinical impact when separating them into low and high 
      grade colon and rectum carcinoma. eIF and mTOR expression were analysed on 
      protein and mRNA level in primary low and high grade colon carcinoma (CC) and 
      rectum carcinoma (RC) samples in comparison to non-neoplastic tissue without any 
      disease-related pathology. To assess the therapeutic potential of targeting eIF1, 
      eIF5 and eIF6 siRNA knockdown in HCT116 and HT29 cells was performed. We 
      evaluated the eIF knockdown efficacy on protein and mRNA level and investigated 
      proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, as well as colony forming and polysome 
      associated fractions. These results indicate that eIFs, in particular eIF1, eIF5 
      and eIF6 play a major role in translational control in colon and rectum cancer.

TI  - Association between borderline dysnatremia and mortality insight into a new data

AB  - BACKGROUND: Even small variations of serum sodium concentration may be associated 
      with mortality. Our objective was to confirm the impact of borderline dysnatremia 
      for patients admitted to hospital on in-hospital mortality using real life care 
      data from our electronic health record (EHR) and a phenome-wide association 
      analysis (PheWAS). METHODS: Retrospective observational study based on patient 
      data admitted to Hôpital Européen George Pompidou, between 01/01/2008 and 
      31/06/2014; including 45,834 patients with serum sodium determinations on 
      admission. We analyzed the association between dysnatremia and in-hospital 
      mortality, using a multivariate logistic regression model to adjust for classical 
      potential confounders. We performed a PheWAS to identify new potential 
      confounders. RESULTS: Hyponatremia and hypernatremia were recorded for 12.0% and 
      1.0% of hospital stays, respectively. Adjusted odds ratios (ORa) for severe, 
      moderate and borderline hyponatremia were 3.44 (95% CI, 2.41-4.86), 2.48 (95% CI, 
      1.96-3.13) and 1.98 (95% CI, 1.73-2.28), respectively. ORa for severe, moderate 
      and borderline hypernatremia were 4.07 (95% CI, 2.92-5.62), 4.42 (95% CI, 
      2.04-9.20) and 3.72 (95% CI, 1.53-8.45), respectively. Borderline hyponatremia 
      (ORa = 1.57 95% CI, 1.35-1.81) and borderline hypernatremia (ORa = 3.47 95% CI, 
      2.43-4.90) were still associated with in-hospital mortality after adjustment for 
      classical and new confounding factors identified through the PheWAS analysis. 
      CONCLUSION: Borderline dysnatremia on admission are independently associated with 
      a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. By using medical data automatically 
      collected in EHR and a new data mining approach, we identified new potential 
      confounding factors that were highly associated with both mortality and 
      dysnatremia.

TI  - Bryophyte gas-exchange dynamics along varying hydration status reveal a 
      significant carbonyl sulphide (COS) sink in the dark and COS source in the light.
PG  - 965-976
LID - 10.1111/nph.14584 [doi]
AB  - Carbonyl sulphide (COS) is a potential tracer of gross primary productivity 
      (GPP), assuming a unidirectional COS flux into the vegetation that scales with 
      GPP. However, carbonic anhydrase (CA), the enzyme that hydrolyses COS, is 
      expected to be light independent, and thus plants without stomata should continue 
      to take up COS in the dark. We measured net CO(2) (A(C) ) and COS (A(S) ) uptake 
      rates from two astomatous bryophytes at different relative water contents (RWCs), 
      COS concentrations, temperatures and light intensities. We found large A(S) in 
      the dark, indicating that CA activity continues without photosynthesis. More 
      surprisingly, we found a nonzero COS compensation point in light and dark 
      conditions, indicating a temperature-driven COS source with a Q(10) (fractional 
      change for a 10°C temperature increase) of 3.7. This resulted in greater A(S) in 
      the dark than in the light at similar RWC. The processes underlying such COS 
      emissions remain unknown. Our results suggest that ecosystems dominated by 
      bryophytes might be strong atmospheric sinks of COS at night and weaker sinks or 
      even sources of COS during daytime. Biotic COS production in bryophytes could 
      result from symbiotic fungal and bacterial partners that could also be found on 
      vascular plants.

TI  - Phenome-wide heritability analysis of the UK Biobank.
PG  - e1006711

LID - e1006711
AB  - Heritability estimation provides important information about the relative 
      contribution of genetic and environmental factors to phenotypic variation, and 
      provides an upper bound for the utility of genetic risk prediction models. Recent 
      technological and statistical advances have enabled the estimation of additive 
      heritability attributable to common genetic variants (SNP heritability) across a 
      broad phenotypic spectrum. Here, we present a computationally and memory 
      efficient heritability estimation method that can handle large sample sizes, and 
      report the SNP heritability for 551 complex traits derived from the interim data 
      release (152,736 subjects) of the large-scale, population-based UK Biobank, 
      comprising both quantitative phenotypes and disease codes. We demonstrate that 
      common genetic variation contributes to a broad array of quantitative traits and 
      human diseases in the UK population, and identify phenotypes whose heritability 
      is moderated by age (e.g., a majority of physical measures including height and 
      body mass index), sex (e.g., blood pressure related traits) and socioeconomic 
      status (education). Our study represents the first comprehensive phenome-wide 
      heritability analysis in the UK Biobank, and underscores the importance of 
      considering population characteristics in interpreting heritability.

AB  - The extensive comorbidity of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents 
      leads to clinical heterogeneity, and is an often-overlooked issue in 
      etiopathogenic and treatment studies in developmental psychopathology. In a 
      representative sample (N=8236) of New York City public school students assessed 
      six months after 9/11, latent class analysis was applied to 48 symptoms across 
      seven disorders: posttraumatic stress, agoraphobia, separation anxiety, panic 
      disorder, generalized anxiety (GAD), major depression (MDD) and conduct disorder 
      (CD). Our objective was to identify classes defined by homogenous symptom 
      profiles, and to examine the association between class membership and gender, 
      age, race, different types of exposure to 9/11, and impairment. Eight homogenous 
      comorbidity patterns were identified, including four severe disturbance classes: 
      a multimorbid internalizing class (INT), a class with a high probability of CD, 
      MDD, and GAD symptoms (Distress/EXT), a non-comorbid externalizing class, and a 
      non-comorbid MDD class. Demographic and 9/11-related exposures showed some degree 
      of specificity in their association with severe symptom profiles. Impairment was 
      particularly high in the INT and Distress/EXT classes. A better characterization 
      of phenomic data, that takes comorbidity into account, is essential to understand 
      etiopathogenic processes, and to move psychiatric research forward towards 
      personalized medicine. The high probability of endorsing symptoms of multiple 
      disorders in the INT and Distress/EXT classes supports the use of treatments 
      focusing on multimorbidity. Clinical trials should evaluate the effectiveness of 
      disorder-specific versus transdiagnostic interventions. The association between 
      class membership and demographic and exposure variables suggests that 
      interventions may be improved by considering specific predictors of class 
      membership.

TI  - Unmodern Synthesis: Developmental Hierarchies and the Origin of Phenotypes.
LID - 10.1002/bies.201600265 [doi]
AB  - The question of whether the modern evolutionary synthesis requires an extension 
      has recently become a topic of discussion, and a source of controversy. We 
      suggest that this debate is, for the most part, not about the modern synthesis at 
      all. Rather, it is about the extent to which genetic mechanisms can be regarded 
      as the primary determinants of phenotypic characters. The modern synthesis has 
      been associated with the idea that phenotypes are the result of gene products, 
      while supporters of the extended synthesis have suggested that environmental 
      factors, along with processes such as epigenetic inheritance, and niche 
      construction play an important role in character formation. We argue that the 
      methodology of the modern evolutionary synthesis has been enormously successful, 
      but does not provide an accurate characterization of the origin of phenotypes. 
      For its part, the extended synthesis has yet to be transformed into a testable 
      theory, and accordingly, has yielded few results. We conclude by suggesting that 
      the origin of phenotypes can only be understood by integrating findings from all 
      levels of the organismal hierarchy. In most cases, parts and processes from a 
      single level fail to accurately explain the presence of a given phenotypic trait.

AB  - Improving fruit quality has become a major goal in plant breeding. Direct 
      approaches to tackling fruit quality traits specifically linked to consumer 
      preferences and environmental friendliness, such as improved flavor, 
      nutraceutical compounds, and sustainability, have slowly been added to a breeder 
      priority list that already includes traits like productivity, efficiency, and, 
      especially, pest and disease control. Breeders already use molecular genetic 
      tools to improve fruit quality although most advances have been made in producer 
      and industrial quality standards. Furthermore, progress has largely been limited 
      to simple agronomic traits easy-to-observe, whereas the vast majority of quality 
      attributes, specifically those relating to flavor and nutrition, are complex and 
      have mostly been neglected. Fortunately, wild germplasm, which is used for 
      resistance against/tolerance of environmental stresses (including pathogens), is 
      still available and harbors significant genetic variation for taste and 
      health-promoting traits. Similarly, heirloom/traditional varieties could be used 
      to identify which genes contribute to flavor and health quality and, at the same 
      time, serve as a good source of the best alleles for organoleptic quality 
      improvement. Grape (Vitis vinifera L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) 
      produce fleshy, berry-type fruits, among the most consumed in the world. Both 
      have undergone important domestication and selection processes, that have 
      dramatically reduced their genetic variability, and strongly standardized fruit 
      traits. Moreover, more and more consumers are asking for sustainable production, 
      incompatible with the wide range of chemical inputs. In the present paper, we 
      review the genetic resources available to tomato/grape breeders, and the recent 
      technological progresses that facilitate the identification of genes/alleles of 
      interest within the natural or generated variability gene pool. These 
      technologies include omics, high-throughput phenotyping/phenomics, and biotech 
      approaches. Our review also covers a range of technologies used to transfer to 
      tomato and grape those alleles considered of interest for fruit quality. These 
      include traditional breeding, TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in 
      Genomes), genetic engineering, or NPBT (New Plant Breeding Technologies). 
      Altogether, the combined exploitation of genetic variability and innovative 
      biotechnological tools may facilitate breeders to improve fruit quality tacking 
      more into account the consumer standards and the needs to move forward into more 
      sustainable farming practices.

AB  - Phenotyping, via remote and proximal sensing techniques, of the agronomic and 
      physiological traits associated with yield potential and drought adaptation could 
      contribute to improvements in breeding programs. In the present study, 384 
      genotypes of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were tested under fully irrigated (FI) 
      and water stress (WS) conditions. The following traits were evaluated and 
      assessed via spectral reflectance: Grain yield (GY), spikes per square meter 
      (SM2), kernels per spike (KPS), thousand-kernel weight (TKW), chlorophyll content 
      (SPAD), stem water soluble carbohydrate concentration and content (WSC and WSCC, 
      respectively), carbon isotope discrimination (Δ(13)C), and leaf area index (LAI). 
      The performances of spectral reflectance indices (SRIs), four regression 
      algorithms (PCR, PLSR, ridge regression RR, and SVR), and three classification 
      methods (PCA-LDA, PLS-DA, and kNN) were evaluated for the prediction of each 
      trait. For the classification approaches, two classes were established for each 
      trait: The lower 80% of the trait variability range (Class 1) and the remaining 
      20% (Class 2 or elite genotypes). Both the SRIs and regression methods performed 
      better when data from FI and WS were combined. The traits that were best 
      estimated by SRIs and regression methods were GY and Δ(13)C. For most traits and 
      conditions, the estimations provided by RR and SVR were the same, or better than, 
      those provided by the SRIs. PLS-DA showed the best performance among the 
      categorical methods and, unlike the SRI and regression models, most traits were 
      relatively well-classified within a specific hydric condition (FI or WS), proving 
      that classification approach is an effective tool to be explored in future 
      studies related to genotype selection.

AB  - Understanding the complex involvement of mitochondrial biology in disease 
      development often requires the acquisition, analysis, and integration of 
      large-scale molecular and phenotypic data. An increasing number of bioinformatics 
      tools are currently employed to aid in mitochondrial investigations, most notably 
      in predicting or corroborating the spatial and temporal dynamics of mitochondrial 
      molecules, in retrieving structural data of mitochondrial components, and in 
      aggregating as well as transforming mitochondrial centric biomedical knowledge. 
      With the increasing prevalence of complex Big Data from omics experiments and 
      clinical cohorts, informatics tools have become indispensable in our quest to 
      understand mitochondrial physiology and pathology. Here we present an overview of 
      the various informatics resources that are helping researchers explore this vital 
      organelle and gain insights into its form, function, and dynamics.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the impact of body mass index (BMI) on postoperative recovery 
      curve of urinary and sexual function after robotic-assisted laparoscopic 
      prostatectomy (RALP). We hypothesized that overweight and obese men have 
      different recovery curves than normal weight men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      reviewed preoperative and postoperative surveys from 691 men who underwent RALP 
      from 2004-2014 in an integrated healthcare delivery system. Survey instruments 
      included: sexual health inventory for men (SHIM), urinary behavior, leakage, and 
      incontinence impact questionnaire (IIQ). A repeated measures analysis with 
      autoregressive covariance structure was employed with linear splines with 2 knots 
      for the time factor. We fit unadjusted and adjusted models and stratified by BMI 
      (under/normal weight, overweight, and obese). Adjusted models included age, 
      race/ethnicity, smoking status, diabetes, operation length, prostate-specific 
      antigen, pathologic stage, nerve-sparing status, and surgery year. RESULTS: Mean 
      age was 59 years. Most men were overweight (43%) and obese (42%). There were no 
      significant differences in mean baseline SHIM, urinary behavior, leakage, and IIQ 
      scores by BMI category. All groups had initial steep declines in urinary and 
      sexual function in the first 3 months after RALP. There were no significant 
      differences in postoperative urinary and sexual function score curves by BMI 
      category. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of urinary and sexual function recovery was 
      similar across all BMI categories. Overweight and obese men may be counseled that 
      urinary and sexual function recovery curves after surgery is similar to that of 
      normal weight men.

AB  - PURPOSE: We describe age, multiple chronic condition profiles and health system 
      contact in patients with urological cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using 
      Geisinger Health System electronic health records we identified adult primary 
      care patients and a subset with at least 1 urology encounter between 2001 and 
      2015. The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality Chronic Condition Indicator 
      and Clinical Classifications Software tools were applied to ICD-9 codes to 
      identify chronic conditions. Multiple chronic conditions were defined as 2 or 
      more chronic conditions. Patients with urological cancer were identified using 
      ICD-9 codes for prostate, bladder, kidney, testis and penile cancer. Inpatient 
      and outpatient visits in the year prior to the most recent encounter were counted 
      to document health system contact. RESULTS: We identified 357,100 primary care 
      and 33,079 urology patients, of whom 4,023 had urological cancer. Patients with 
      urological cancer were older than primary care patients (71 vs 46 years) and they 
      had more median chronic conditions (7 vs 4). Kidney and bladder cancer were the 
      most common chronic conditions (median 8 patients each). Coronary artery disease 
      and chronic kidney disease were common in urological cancer cases compared to 
      mental health conditions in primary care cases. Patients with urological cancer 
      who had multiple chronic conditions had the most health system contact, including 
      32% with at least 1 hospitalization and 68% with more than 5 outpatient visits 
      during 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Urology patients are older and more medically 
      complex, especially those with urological cancer than primary care patients. 
      These data may inform care redesign to reduce the treatment burden and improve 
      care coordination in urological cancer cases.

TI  - Objective assessment of dietary patterns by use of metabolic phenotyping: a 
      randomised, controlled, crossover trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate monitoring of changes in dietary patterns in response to 
      food policy implementation is challenging. Metabolic profiling allows 
      simultaneous measurement of hundreds of metabolites in urine, the concentrations 
      of which can be affected by food intake. We hypothesised that metabolic profiles 
      of urine samples developed under controlled feeding conditions reflect dietary 
      intake and can be used to model and classify dietary patterns of free-living 
      populations. METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, crossover trial, we 
      recruited healthy volunteers (aged 21-65 years, BMI 20-35 kg/m(2)) from a 
      database of a clinical research unit in the UK. We developed four dietary 
      interventions with a stepwise variance in concordance with the WHO healthy eating 
      guidelines that aim to prevent non-communicable diseases (increase fruits, 
      vegetables, whole grains, and dietary fibre; decrease fats, sugars, and salt). 
      Participants attended four inpatient stays (72 h each, separated by at least 5 
      days), during which they were given one dietary intervention. The order of diets 
      was randomly assigned across study visits. Randomisation was done by an 
      independent investigator, with the use of opaque, sealed, sequentially numbered 
      envelopes that each contained one of the four dietary interventions in a random 
      order. Participants and investigators were not masked from the dietary 
      intervention, but investigators analysing the data were masked from the 
      randomisation order. During each inpatient period, urine was collected daily over 
      three timed periods: morning (0900-1300 h), afternoon (1300-1800 h), and evening 
      and overnight (1800-0900 h); 24 h urine samples were obtained by pooling these 
      samples. Urine samples were assessed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance 
      ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy, and diet-discriminatory metabolites were identified. We 
      developed urinary metabolite models for each diet and identified the associated 
      metabolic profiles, and then validated the models using data and samples from the 
      INTERMAP UK cohort (n=225) and a healthy-eating Danish cohort (n=66). This study 
      is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN43087333. FINDINGS: Between Aug 13, 2013, 
      and May 18, 2014, we contacted 300 people with a letter of invitation. 78 
      responded, of whom 26 were eligible and invited to attend a health screening. Of 
      20 eligible participants who were randomised, 19 completed all four 72 h study 
      stays between Oct 2, 2013, and July 29, 2014, and consumed all the food provided. 
      Analysis of (1)H-NMR spectroscopy data indicated that urinary metabolic profiles 
      of the four diets were distinct. Significant stepwise differences in metabolite 
      concentrations were seen between diets with the lowest and highest metabolic 
      risks. Application of the derived metabolite models to the validation datasets 
      confirmed the association between urinary metabolic and dietary profiles in the 
      INTERMAP UK cohort (p<0·0001) and the Danish cohort (p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: 
      Urinary metabolite models developed in a highly controlled environment can 
      classify groups of free-living people into consumers of diets associated with 
      lower or higher non-communicable disease risk on the basis of multivariate 
      metabolite patterns. This approach enables objective monitoring of dietary 
      patterns in population settings and enhances the validity of dietary reporting.

TI  - Development and Assessment of Fully Automated and Globally Transitive Geometric 
      Morphometric Methods, With Application to a Biological Comparative Dataset With 
      High Interspecific Variation.
PG  - 636-658
LID - 10.1002/ar.23700 [doi]
AB  - Automated geometric morphometric methods are promising tools for shape analysis 
      in comparative biology, improving researchers' abilities to quantify variation 
      extensively (by permitting more specimens to be analyzed) and intensively (by 
      characterizing shapes with greater fidelity). Although use of these methods has 
      increased, published automated methods have some notable limitations: pairwise 
      correspondences are frequently inaccurate and pairwise mappings are not globally 
      consistent (i.e., they lack transitivity across the full sample). Here, we 
      reassess the accuracy of published automated methods-cPDist (Boyer et al. Proc 
      Nat Acad Sci 108 () 18221-18226) and auto3Dgm (Boyer et al.: Anat Rec 298 () 
      249-276)-and evaluate several modifications to these methods. We show that a 
      substantial percentage of alignments and pairwise maps between specimens of 
      dissimilar geometries were inaccurate in the study of Boyer et al. (Proc Nat Acad 
      Sci 108 () 18221-18226), despite a taxonomically partitioned variance structure 
      of continuous Procrustes distances. We show these inaccuracies are remedied using 
      a globally informed methodology within a collection of shapes, rather than 
      relying on pairwise comparisons (c.f. Boyer et al.: Anat Rec 298 () 249-276). 
      Unfortunately, while global information generally enhances maps between 
      dissimilar objects, it can degrade the quality of correspondences between similar 
      objects due to the accumulation of numerical error. We explore a number of 
      approaches to mitigate this degradation, quantify their performance, and compare 
      the generated pairwise maps (and the shape space characterized by these maps) to 
      a "ground truth" obtained from landmarks manually collected by geometric 
      morphometricians. Novel methods both improve the quality of the pairwise 
      correspondences relative to cPDist and achieve a taxonomic distinctiveness 
      comparable to auto3Dgm. Anat Rec, 301:636-658, 2018. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals,

TI  - Mimvec: a deep learning approach for analyzing the human phenome.
PG  - 76
LID - 10.1186/s12918-017-0451-z [doi]
LID - 76
AB  - BACKGROUND: The human phenome has been widely used with a variety of genomic data 
      sources in the inference of disease genes. However, most existing methods thus 
      far derive phenotype similarity based on the analysis of biomedical databases by 
      using the traditional term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) 
      formulation. This framework, though intuitive, not only ignores semantic 
      relationships between words but also tends to produce high-dimensional vectors, 
      and hence lacks the ability to precisely capture intrinsic semantic 
      characteristics of biomedical documents. To overcome these limitations, we 
      propose a framework called mimvec to analyze the human phenome by making use of 
      the state-of-the-art deep learning technique in natural language processing. 
      RESULTS: We converted 24,061 records in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 
      (OMIM) database to low-dimensional vectors using our method. We demonstrated that 
      the vector presentation not only effectively enabled classification of phenotype 
      records against gene ones, but also succeeded in discriminating diseases of 
      different inheritance styles and different mechanisms. We further derived 
      pairwise phenotype similarities between 7988 human inherited diseases using their 
      vector presentations. With a joint analysis of this phenome with multiple genomic 
      data, we showed that phenotype overlap indeed implied genotype overlap. We 
      finally used the derived phenotype similarities with genomic data to prioritize 
      candidate genes and demonstrated advantages of this method over existing ones. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our method is capable of not only capturing semantic relationships 
      between words in biomedical records but also alleviating the dimensional disaster 
      accompanying the traditional TF-IDF framework. With the approaching of precision 
      medicine, there will be abundant electronic records of medicine and health 
      awaiting for deep analysis, and we expect to see a wide spectrum of applications 
      borrowing the idea of our method in the near future.

TI  - Integrating omics to unravel the stress-response mechanisms in probiotic 
      bacteria: Approaches, challenges, and prospects.
PG  - 3464-3471
LID - 10.1080/10408398.2015.1136805 [doi]
AB  - Identifying the stress-response mechanism of probiotic bacteria has always 
      captivated the interest of food producers. It is crucial to identify probiotic 
      bacteria that have increased stress tolerance to survive during production, 
      processing, and storage of food products. However, in order to achieve high 
      resistance to environmental factors, there is a need to better understand 
      stress-induced responses and adaptive mechanisms. With advances in bacterial 
      genomics, there has been an upsurge in the application of other omic platforms 
      such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and some more recent ones such 
      as interactomics, fluxomics, and phenomics. These omic technologies have 
      revolutionized the functional genomics and their application. There have been 
      several studies implementing various omic technologies to investigate the stress 
      responses of probiotic bacteria. Integrated omics has the potential to provide 
      in-depth information about the mechanisms of stress-induced responses in 
      bacteria. However, there remain challenges in integrating information from 
      different omic platforms. This review discusses current omic techniques and 
      challenges faced in integrating various omic platforms with focus on their use in 
      stress-response studies.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Patient-Derived In Vitro Sarcoma Models: Promising Tools for 
      Improving Clinical Tumor Management.
PG  - 203

AB  - Over the past decade, the development of new targeted therapeutics directed 
      against specific molecular pathways involved in tumor cell proliferation and 
      survival has allowed an essential improvement in carcinoma treatment. 
      Unfortunately, the scenario is different for sarcomas, a group of malignant 
      neoplasms originating from mesenchymal cells, for which the main therapeutic 
      approach still consists in the combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and 
      radiation therapy. The lack of innovative approaches in sarcoma treatment stems 
      from the high degree of heterogeneity of this tumor type, with more that 70 
      different histopathological subtypes, and the limited knowledge of the molecular 
      drivers of tumor development and progression. Currently, molecular therapies are 
      available mainly for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor, a 
      soft-tissue malignancy characterized by an activating mutation of the tyrosine 
      kinase KIT. Since the first application of this approach, a strong effort has 
      been made to understand sarcoma molecular alterations that can be potential 
      targets for therapy. The low incidence combined with the high level of 
      histopathological heterogeneity makes the development of clinical trials for 
      sarcomas very challenging. For this reason, preclinical studies are needed to 
      better understand tumor biology with the aim to develop new targeted 
      therapeutics. Currently, these studies are mainly based on in vitro testing, 
      since cell lines, and in particular patient-derived models, represent a reliable 
      and easy to handle tool for investigation. In the present review, we summarize 
      the most important models currently available in the field, focusing in 
      particular on the three-dimensional spheroid/organoid model. This innovative 
      approach for studying tumor biology better represents tissue architecture and 
      cell-cell as well as cell-microenvironment crosstalk, which are fundamental steps 
      for tumor cell proliferation and survival.

TI  - PSB33 sustains photosystem II D1 protein under fluctuating light conditions.
PG  - 4281-4293
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erx218 [doi]
AB  - On Earth, solar irradiance varies as the sun rises and sets over the horizon, and 
      sunlight is thus in constant fluctuation, following a slow dark-low-high-low-dark 
      curve. Optimal plant growth and development are dependent on the capacity of 
      plants to acclimate and regulate photosynthesis in response to these changes of 
      light. Little is known of regulative processes for photosynthesis during 
      nocturnal events. The nucleus-encoded plant lineage-specific protein PSB33 has 
      been described as stabilizing the photosystem II complex, especially under light 
      stress conditions, and plants lacking PSB33 have a dysfunctional state 
      transition. To clarify the localization and function of this protein, we used 
      phenomic, biochemical and proteomics approaches in the model plant Arabidopsis. 
      We report that PSB33 is predominantly located in non-appressed thylakoid regions 
      and dynamically associates with a thylakoid protein complex in a light-dependent 
      manner. Moreover, plants lacking PSB33 show an accelerated D1 protein degradation 
      in nocturnal periods, and show severely stunted growth when challenged with 
      fluctuating light. We further show that the function of PSB33 precedes the STN7 
      kinase to regulate or balance the excitation energy of photosystems I and II in 
      fluctuating light conditions.

TI  - Perspective on precision medicine in paediatric heart failure.
PG  - 439-448
LID - 10.1042/CS20160414 [doi]
AB  - In 2015, President Obama launched the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), which 
      introduced new funding to a method of research with the potential to study rare 
      and complex diseases. Paediatric heart failure, a heterogeneous syndrome 
      affecting approximately 1 in 100000 children, is one such condition in which 
      precision medicine techniques may be applied with great benefit. Current heart 
      failure therapies target downstream effects of heart failure rather than the 
      underlying cause of heart failure. As such, they are often ineffective in 
      paediatric heart failure, which is typically of primary (e.g. genetic) rather 
      than secondary (e.g. acquired) aetiology. It is, therefore, important to develop 
      therapies that can target the causes of heart failure in children with greater 
      specificity thereby decreasing morbidity, mortality and burden of illness on both 
      patients and their families. The benefits of co-ordinated research in genomics, 
      proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics and phenomics along with dietary, 
      lifestyle and social factors have led to novel therapeutic and prognostic 
      applications in other fields such as oncology. Applying such co-ordinated 
      research efforts to heart failure constitutes an important step in advancing care 
      and improving the lives of those affected.

AB  - The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii possesses a repertoire of 
      11 myosins. Three class XIV motors participate in motility, invasion and egress, 
      whereas the class XXII myosin F is implicated in organelle positioning and 
      inheritance of the apicoplast. Here we provide evidence that TgUNC acts as a 
      chaperone dedicated to the folding, assembly and function of all Toxoplasma 
      myosins. The conditional ablation of TgUNC recapitulates the phenome of the known 
      myosins and uncovers two functions in parasite basal complex constriction and 
      synchronized division within the parasitophorous vacuole. We identify myosin J 
      and centrin 2 as essential for the constriction. We demonstrate the existence of 
      an intravacuolar cell-cell communication ensuring synchronized division, a 
      process dependent on myosin I. This connectivity contributes to the delayed death 
      phenotype resulting from loss of the apicoplast. Cell-cell communication is lost 
      in activated macrophages and during bradyzoite differentiation resulting in 
      asynchronized, slow division in the cysts.

TI  - A Comprehensive Biophysical Model of Ion and Water Transport in Plant Roots. I. 
      Clarifying the Roles of Endodermal Barriers in the Salt Stress Response.
PG  - 1326

LID - 1326
AB  - In this paper, we present a detailed and comprehensive mathematical model of 
      active and passive ion and water transport in plant roots. Two key features are 
      the explicit consideration of the separate, but interconnected, apoplastic, and 
      symplastic transport pathways for ions and water, and the inclusion of both 
      active and passive ion transport mechanisms. The model is used to investigate the 
      respective roles of the endodermal Casparian strip and suberin lamellae in the 
      salt stress response of plant roots. While it is thought that these barriers 
      influence different transport pathways, it has proven difficult to distinguish 
      their separate functions experimentally. In particular, the specific role of the 
      suberin lamellae has been unclear. A key finding based on our simulations was 
      that the Casparian strip is essential in preventing excessive uptake of Na(+) 
      into the plant via apoplastic bypass, with a barrier efficiency that is reflected 
      by a sharp gradient in the steady-state radial distribution of apoplastic Na(+) 
      across the barrier. Even more significantly, this function cannot be replaced by 
      the action of membrane transporters. The simulations also demonstrated that the 
      positive effect of the Casparian strip of controlling Na(+) uptake, was somewhat 
      offset by its contribution to the osmotic stress component: a more effective 
      barrier increased the detrimental osmotic stress effect. In contrast, the suberin 
      lamellae were found to play a relatively minor, even non-essential, role in the 
      overall response to salt stress, with the presence of the suberin lamellae 
      resulting in only a slight reduction in Na(+) uptake. However, perhaps more 
      significantly, the simulations identified a possible role of suberin lamellae in 
      reducing plant energy requirements by acting as a physical barrier to preventing 
      the passive leakage of Na(+) into endodermal cells. The model results suggest 
      that more and particular experimental attention should be paid to the properties 
      of the Casparian strip when assessing the salt tolerance of different plant 
      varieties and species. Indeed, the Casparian strip appears to be a more promising 
      target for plant breeding and plant genetic engineering efforts than the suberin 
      lamellae for the goal of improving salt tolerance.

TI  - Identification of shared risk loci and pathways for bipolar disorder and 
      schizophrenia.
PG  - e0171595
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0171595 [doi]
LID - e0171595
AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable neuropsychiatric disease 
      characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. BD shows substantial 
      clinical and genetic overlap with other psychiatric disorders, in particular 
      schizophrenia (SCZ). The genes underlying this etiological overlap remain largely 
      unknown. A recent SCZ genome wide association study (GWAS) by the Psychiatric 
      Genomics Consortium identified 128 independent genome-wide significant single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The present study investigated whether these 
      SCZ-associated SNPs also contribute to BD development through the performance of 
      association testing in a large BD GWAS dataset (9747 patients, 14278 controls). 
      After re-imputation and correction for sample overlap, 22 of 107 investigated SCZ 
      SNPs showed nominal association with BD. The number of shared SCZ-BD SNPs was 
      significantly higher than expected (p = 1.46x10-8). This provides further 
      evidence that SCZ-associated loci contribute to the development of BD. Two SNPs 
      remained significant after Bonferroni correction. The most strongly associated 
      SNP was located near TRANK1, which is a reported genome-wide significant risk 
      gene for BD. Pathway analyses for all shared SCZ-BD SNPs revealed 25 nominally 
      enriched gene-sets, which showed partial overlap in terms of the underlying 
      genes. The enriched gene-sets included calcium- and glutamate signaling, 
      neuropathic pain signaling in dorsal horn neurons, and calmodulin binding. The 
      present data provide further insights into shared risk loci and 
      disease-associated pathways for BD and SCZ. This may suggest new research 
      directions for the treatment and prevention of these two major psychiatric 
      disorders.

AB  - Drought is one of the major abiotic stresses reducing crop yield. Since the 
      discovery of plant microRNAs (miRNAs), considerable progress has been made in 
      clarifying their role in plant responses to abiotic stresses, including drought. 
      miR827 was previously reported to confer drought tolerance in transgenic 
      Arabidopsis. We examined barley (Hordeum vulgare L. 'Golden Promise') plants 
      over-expressing miR827 for plant performance under drought. Transgenic plants 
      constitutively expressing CaMV-35S::Ath-miR827 and drought-inducible 
      Zm-Rab17::Hv-miR827 were phenotyped by non-destructive imaging for growth and 
      whole plant water use efficiency (WUE(wp)). We observed that the growth, WUE(wp), 
      time to anthesis and grain weight of transgenic barley plants expressing 
      CaMV-35S::Ath-miR827 were negatively affected in both well-watered and 
      drought-treated growing conditions compared with the wild-type plants. In 
      contrast, transgenic plants over-expressing Zm-Rab17::Hv-miR827 showed improved 
      WUE(wp) with no growth or reproductive timing change compared with the wild-type 
      plants. The recovery of Zm-Rab17::Hv-miR827 over-expressing plants also improved 
      following severe drought stress. Our results suggest that Hv-miR827 has the 
      potential to improve the performance of barley under drought and that the choice 
      of promoter to control the timing and specificity of miRNA expression is 
      critical.

AB  - Drought is a crucial environmental constraint limiting crop production in many 
      parts of the world. microRNA (miRNA) based gene regulation has been shown to act 
      in several pathways, including crop response to drought stress. Sequence based 
      profiling and computational analysis have revealed hundreds of miRNAs and their 
      potential targets in different plant species under various stress conditions, but 
      few have been biologically verified. In this study, 11 candidate miRNAs were 
      tested for their expression profiles in barley. Differences in accumulation of 
      only four miRNAs (Ath-miR169b, Osa-miR1432, Hv-miRx5 and Hv-miR166b/c) were 
      observed between drought-treated and well-watered barley in four genotypes. miRNA 
      targets were predicted using degradome analysis of two, different genotypes, and 
      genotype-specific target cleavage was observed. Inverse correlation of mature 
      miRNA accumulation with miRNA target transcripts was also genotype dependent 
      under drought treatment. Drought-responsive miRNAs accumulated predominantly in 
      mesophyll tissues. Our results demonstrate genotype-specific miRNA regulation 
      under drought stress and evidence for their role in mediating expression of 
      target genes for abiotic stress response in barley.

AB  - Pigments absorb light, transform it into energy, and provide reaction sites for 
      photosynthesis; thus, the quantification of pigment distribution is vital to 
      plant research. Traditional methods for the quantification of pigments are 
      time-consuming and not suitable for the high-throughput digitization of rice 
      pigment distribution. In this study, using a hyperspectral imaging system, we 
      developed an integrated image analysis pipeline for automatically processing 
      enormous amounts of hyperspectral data. We also built models for accurately 
      quantifying 4 pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll and 
      carotenoid) from rice leaves and determined the important bands (700-760 nm) 
      associated with these pigments. At the tillering stage, the R(2) values and mean 
      absolute percentage errors of the models were 0.827-0.928 and 6.94-12.84%, 
      respectively. The hyperspectral data and these models can be combined for 
      digitizing the distribution of the chlorophyll with high resolution (0.11 
      mm/pixel). In summary, the integrated hyperspectral image analysis pipeline and 
      selected models can be used to quantify the chlorophyll distribution in rice 
      leaves. The use of this technique will benefit rice functional genomics and rice 
      breeding.

AB  - With progress of genetic sequencing technology, plant genomics has experienced 
      rapid development and subsequently triggered the progress of plant phenomics. In 
      this study, a high-throughput hyperspectral imaging system (HHIS) was developed 
      to obtain 1,540 hyperspectral indices at whole-plant level during tillering, 
      heading, and ripening stages. These indices were used to quantify traditional 
      agronomic traits and to explore genetic variation. We performed genome-wide 
      association study (GWAS) of these indices and traditional agronomic traits in a 
      global rice collection of 529 accessions. With the genome-level suggestive 
      P-value threshold, 989 loci were identified. Of the 1,540 indices, we detected 
      502 significant indices (designated as hyper-traits) that exhibited phenotypic 
      and genetic relationship with traditional agronomic traits and had high 
      heritability. Many hyper-trait-associated loci could not be detected using 
      traditional agronomic traits. For example, we identified a candidate gene 
      controlling chlorophyll content (Chl). This gene, which was not identified based 
      on Chl, was significantly associated with a chlorophyll-related hyper-trait in 
      GWAS and was demonstrated to control Chl. Moreover, our study demonstrates that 
      red edge (680-760 nm) is vital for rice research for phenotypic and genetic 
      insights. Thus, combination of HHIS and GWAS provides a novel platform for 
      dissection of complex traits and for crop breeding.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individual-level concomitance of infectious diseases and 
      noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is poorly studied, despite the reality of this 
      dual disease burden for many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). OBJECTIVE: 
      This study protocol describes the implementation of a cohort and biobank aiming 
      for a better understanding of interrelation of helminth and Plasmodium infections 
      with NCD phenotypes like metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and diabetes. METHODS: 
      A baseline cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted over one year, 
      in the Taabo health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) in south-central 
      Côte d'Ivoire. We randomly identified 1020 consenting participants aged ≥18 years 
      in three communities (Taabo-Cité, Amani-Ménou, and Tokohiri) reflecting varying 
      stages of epidemiological transition. Participants underwent health examinations 
      consisting of NCD phenotyping (anthropometry, blood pressure, renal function, 
      glycemia, and lipids) and infectious disease testing (infections with 
      soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomes, and Plasmodium). Individuals identified 
      to have elevated blood pressure, glucose, lipids, or with infections were 
      referred to the central/national health center for diagnostic confirmation and 
      treatment. Aliquots of urine, stool, and venous blood were stored in a biobank 
      for future exposome/phenome research. In-person interviews on sociodemographic 
      attributes, risk factors for infectious diseases and NCDs, medication, 
      vaccinations, and health care were also conducted. Appropriate statistical 
      techniques will be applied in exploring the concomitance of infectious diseases 
      and NCDs and their determinants. Participants' consent for follow-up contact was 
      obtained. RESULTS: Key results from this baseline study, which will be published 
      in peer-reviewed literature, will provide information on the prevalence and 
      co-occurrence of infectious diseases, NCDs, and their risk factors. The Taabo 
      HDSS consists of rural and somewhat more urbanized areas, allowing for 
      comparative studies at different levels of epidemiological transition. An HDSS 
      setting is ideal as a basis for longitudinal studies since their sustainable 
      field work teams hold close contact with the local population. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      collaboration between research institutions, public health organizations, health 
      care providers, and staff from the Taabo HDSS in this study assures that the 
      synthesized evidence will feed into health policy towards integrated infectious 
      disease-NCD management. The preparation of health systems for the dual burden of 
      disease is pressing in low- and middle-income countries. The established biobank 
      will strengthen the local research capacity and offer opportunities for biomarker 
      studies to deepen the understanding of the cross-talk between infectious diseases 
      and NCDs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials

AB  - Sepsis, with its often devastating consequences for patients and their families, 
      remains a major public health concern that poses an increasing financial burden. 
      Early resuscitation together with the elucidation of the biological pathways and 
      pathophysiological mechanisms with the use of "-omics" technologies have started 
      changing the clinical and research landscape in sepsis. Metabolomics (i.e., the 
      study of the metabolome), an "-omics" technology further down in the "-omics" 
      cascade between the genome and the phenome, could be particularly fruitful in 
      sepsis research with the potential to alter the clinical practice. Apart from its 
      benefit for the individual patient, metabolomics has an impact on public health 
      that extends beyond its applications in medicine. In this review, we present 
      recent developments in metabolomics research in sepsis, with a focus on 
      pneumonia, and we discuss the impact of metabolomics on public health, with a 
      focus on free/libre open source software.

AB  - Human ageing is an extremely personal process leading across the life course of 
      individuals to large population heterogeneity in the decline of functional 
      capacity, health and lifespan. The extremes of this process are witnessed by the 
      healthy vital 100-year-olds on one end and the 60-year-olds suffering from 
      multiple morbid conditions on the other end of the spectrum. Molecular studies 
      into the basis of this heterogeneity have focused on a range of endpoints and 
      methodological approaches. The phenotype definitions most prominently 
      investigated in these studies are either lifespan-related or biomarker based 
      indices of the biological ageing rate of individuals and their tissues. Unlike 
      for many complex, age-related diseases, consensus on the ultimate set of 
      multi-biomarker ageing or lifespan-related phenotypes for genetic and genomic 
      studies has not been reached yet. Comparable to animal models, hallmarks of 
      age-related disease risk, healthy ageing and longevity include immune and 
      metabolic pathways. Potentially novel genomic regions and pathways have been 
      identified among many (epi)genomic studies into chronological age and studies 
      into human lifespan regulation, with APOE and FOXO3A representing yet the most 
      robust loci. Functional analysis of a handful of genes in cell-based and animal 
      models is ongoing. The way forward in human ageing and longevity studies seems 
      through improvements in the interpretation of the biology of the genome, in 
      application of computational and systems biology, integration with animal models 
      and by harmonization of repeated phenotypic and omics measures in longitudinal 
      and intervention studies. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Model 
      Systems of Aging - edited by "Houtkooper Riekelt".

AB  - A phenome-wide association study of variants in genes in the Th17 and IL-17 
      pathway was performed using self-reported phenotypes and genetic data from 
      521,000 research participants of 23andMe. Results replicated known associations 
      with similar effect sizes for autoimmune traits illustrating self-reported traits 
      can be a surrogate for clinically assessed conditions. Novel associations 
      controlling for a false discovery rate of 5% included the association of the 
      variant encoding p.Ile684Ser in TYK2 with increased risk of tonsillectomy, strep 
      throat occurrences and teen acne, the variant encoding p.Arg381Gln in IL23R with 
      a decrease in dandruff frequency, the variant encoding p.Asp10Asn in TRAF3IP2 
      with risk of male-pattern balding, and the RORC regulatory variant (rs4845604) 
      with protection from allergies. This approach enabled rapid assessment of 
      association with a wide variety of traits and investigation of traits with 
      limited reported associations to overlay meaningful phenotypic context on the 
      range of conditions being considered for drugs targeting this pathway.

AB  - The medical burden of heart failure (HF) has spurred interest in clinicians and 
      scientists to develop therapies to restore the function of a failing heart. To 
      advance this agenda, the National Heart Lung Blood Institute (NHLBI) convened a 
      Working Group of experts on June 2-3, 2016 in Bethesda Maryland to develop 
      recommendations for the NHLBI aimed at advancing the science of cardiac recovery 
      in the setting of mechanical circulatory support (MCS). MSC devices effectively 
      reduce volume and pressure overload that drives the cycle of progressive 
      myocardial dysfunction, thereby triggering structural and functional reverse 
      remodeling. Research in this field could be innovative in many ways and the 
      Working Group specifically discussed opportunities associated with genome-phenome 
      systems biology approaches, genetic epidemiology, bioinformatics and precision 
      medicine at the population level, advanced imaging modalities including molecular 
      and metabolic imaging, and developing minimally invasive surgical and 
      percutaneous bioengineering approaches. These new avenues of investigations could 
      lead to new treatments that target phylogenetically conserved pathways involved 
      in cardiac reparative mechanisms. A central point that emerged from the NHLBI 
      Working Group meeting was that the lessons learned from the MCS investigational 
      setting can be extrapolated to the broader HF population. With the precedents set 
      by the significant impact of studies of other well-controlled and tractable 
      subsets on larger populations, such as the genetic work in both cancer and 
      cardiovascular disease, the work to improve our understanding of cardiac recovery 
      and resilience in MCS patients could be transformational for the greater HF 
      population.

TI  - Phenome-Wide Association Study of Rheumatoid Arthritis Subgroups Identifies 
      Association Between Seronegative Disease and Fibromyalgia.
PG  - 291-300
LID - 10.1002/art.39851 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The differences between seronegative and seropositive rheumatoid 
      arthritis (RA) have not been widely reported. We performed electronic health 
      record (EHR)-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) to identify disease 
      associations in seropositive and seronegative RA. METHODS: A validated algorithm 
      identified RA subjects from the de-identified version of the Vanderbilt 
      University Medical Center EHR. Serotypes were determined by rheumatoid factor 
      (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) values. We tested 
      EHR-derived phenotypes using PheWAS comparing seropositive RA and seronegative 
      RA, yielding disease associations. PheWAS was also performed in RF-positive 
      versus RF-negative subjects and ACPA-positive versus ACPA-negative subjects. 
      Following PheWAS, select phenotypes were then manually reviewed, and fibromyalgia 
      was specifically evaluated using a validated algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 2,199 
      RA individuals with either RF or ACPA testing were identified. Of these, 1,382 
      patients (63%) were classified as seropositive. Seronegative RA was associated 
      with myalgia and myositis (odds ratio [OR] 2.1, P = 3.7 × 10(-10) ) and back 
      pain. A manual review of the health record showed that among subjects coded for 
      Myalgia and Myositis, ∼80% had fibromyalgia. Follow-up with a specific EHR 
      algorithm for fibromyalgia confirmed that seronegative RA was associated with 
      fibromyalgia (OR 1.8, P = 4.0 × 10(-6) ). Seropositive RA was associated with 
      chronic airway obstruction (OR 2.2, P = 1.4 × 10(-4) ) and tobacco use (OR 2.2, 
      P = 7.0 × 10(-4) ). CONCLUSION: This PheWAS of RA patients identifies a strong 
      association between seronegativity and fibromyalgia. It also affirms 
      relationships between seropositivity and chronic airway obstruction and between 
      seropositivity and tobacco use. These findings demonstrate the utility of the 
      PheWAS approach to discover novel phenotype associations within different 
      subgroups of a disease.

      Mouse Brain.

AB  - Engagement of integrins by the extracellular matrix initiates signaling cascades 
      that drive a variety of cellular functions, including neuronal migration and 
      axonal pathfinding in the brain. Multiple lines of evidence link the ITGB3 gene 
      encoding the integrin β3 subunit with the serotonin (5-HT) system, likely via its 
      modulation of the 5-HT transporter (SERT). The ITGB3 coding polymorphism Leu33Pro 
      (rs5918, Pl(A2)) produces hyperactive αvβ3 receptors that influence whole-blood 
      5-HT levels and may influence the risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using 
      a phenome-wide scan of psychiatric diagnoses, we found significant, male-specific 
      associations between the Pro33 allele and attention-deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder and ASDs. Here, we used knock-in (KI) mice expressing an Itgb3 variant 
      that phenocopies the human Pro33 variant to elucidate the consequences of 
      constitutively enhanced αvβ3 signaling to the 5-HT system in the brain. KI mice 
      displayed deficits in multiple behaviors, including anxiety, repetitive, and 
      social behaviors. Anatomical studies revealed a significant decrease in 5-HT 
      synapses in the midbrain, accompanied by decreases in SERT activity and reduced 
      localization of SERTs to integrin adhesion complexes in synapses of KI mice. 
      Inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) rescued SERT function in synapses of KI 
      mice, demonstrating that constitutive active FAK signaling downstream of the 
      Pro32Pro33 integrin αvβ3 suppresses SERT activity. Our studies identify a complex 
      regulation of 5-HT homeostasis and behaviors by integrin αvβ3, revealing an 
      important role for integrins in modulating risk for neuropsychiatric 
      disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The integrin β3 Leu33Pro coding polymorphism has 
      been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) within a subgroup of 
      patients with elevated blood 5-HT levels, linking integrin β3, 5-HT, and ASD 
      risk. We capitalized on these interactions to demonstrate that the Pro33 coding 
      variation in the murine integrin β3 recapitulates the sex-dependent neurochemical 
      and behavioral attributes of ASD. Using state-of-the-art techniques, we show that 
      presynaptic 5-HT function is altered in these mice, and that the localization of 
      5-HT transporters to specific compartments within the synapse, disrupted by the 
      integrin β3 Pro33 mutation, is critical for appropriate reuptake of 5-HT. Our 
      studies provide fundamental insight into the genetic network regulating 5-HT 
      neurotransmission in the CNS that is also associated with ASD risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying genetic relationships between complex traits in emerging 
      adulthood can provide useful etiological insights into risk for psychopathology. 
      College-age individuals are under-represented in genomic analyses thus far, and 
      the majority of work has focused on the clinical disorder or cognitive abilities 
      rather than normal-range behavioral outcomes. METHODS: This study examined a 
      sample of emerging adults 18-22 years of age (N = 5947) to construct an atlas of 
      polygenic risk for 33 traits predicting relevant phenotypic outcomes. 
      Twenty-eight hypotheses were tested based on the previous literature on samples 
      of European ancestry, and the availability of rich assessment data allowed for 
      polygenic predictions across 55 psychological and medical phenotypes. RESULTS: 
      Polygenic risk for schizophrenia (SZ) in emerging adults predicted anxiety, 
      depression, nicotine use, trauma, and family history of psychological disorders. 
      Polygenic risk for neuroticism predicted anxiety, depression, phobia, panic, 
      neuroticism, and was correlated with polygenic risk for cardiovascular disease. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the extensive impact of genetic risk for 
      SZ, neuroticism, and major depression on a range of health outcomes in early 
      adulthood. Minimal cross-ancestry replication of these phenomic patterns of 
      polygenic influence underscores the need for more genome-wide association studies 
      of non-European populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endometriosis symptoms often start at a young age, and the time 
      between symptom onset and endometriosis diagnosis can be several years. It is not 
      clear whether the symptoms that are experienced by adolescents differ from 
      adults. Better understanding may shorten the often lengthy delay in diagnosis. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to further elucidate the symptom 
      presentation of adolescents as compared with adults to determine whether 
      differences existed, based on age at surgical diagnosis that could impact time to 
      diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: This investigation was a cross-sectional study at 
      enrollment within a longitudinal cohort of adolescents and women with 
      endometriosis. The population-based cohort was recruited from 2 tertiary care 
      centers and the surrounding communities. Participants included adolescents 
      (diagnosed at ≤18 years old; n=295) and adults (diagnosed at >18 years old; 
      n=107) with surgically confirmed endometriosis who were enrolled into The Women's 
      Health Study: From Adolescence to Adulthood. Participants completed an expanded 
      version of the World Endometriosis Research Foundation Endometriosis Phenome and 
      Biobanking Harmonization Project standard clinical questionnaire that included 
      items regarding menstrual history, associated symptoms, and pain. Chi-square or 
      Fisher's exact tests were applied to categoric data; Wilcoxon rank sum tests were 
      applied to continuous data. RESULTS: Most participants (90%) experienced 
      moderate-severe menstrual pain. On average, 3 doctors were seen before diagnosis, 
      regardless of age at presentation (range, 0-25 years). Time from symptoms to 
      diagnosis averaged 2 years for adolescents and 5 years for adults (P<.001). More 
      adolescents (50%) than adults (33%) reported pain starting at menarche (P=.002) 
      and nausea accompanying pain (69% vs 53%; P=.01). Noncyclic, general pelvic pain 
      was prevalent. One-half of the participants reported relief of their general 
      pelvic pain after a bowel movement. Pain interfered with work/school, daily 
      activities, exercise, and sleep to a moderate-extreme degree; difficulties were 
      similar by age at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic pain was severe and noncyclic 
      and negatively impacted quality of life. At our tertiary care centers, symptoms 
      of endometriosis did not differ between women surgically diagnosed during 
      adolescence compared with those diagnosed as adults. Adolescents had more nausea 
      and symptom onset at menarche. Multi-year delays in diagnosis were common. 
      Clinicians should be aware of these alternate symptom patterns and include 
      endometriosis in their differential diagnosis for both adolescent and young adult 
      women who experience noncyclic pelvic pain and nausea.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetics of depression has been explored in genome-wide 
      association studies that focused on either major depressive disorder or 
      depressive symptoms with mostly negative findings. A broad depression phenotype 
      including both phenotypes has not been tested previously using a genome-wide 
      association approach. We aimed to identify genetic polymorphisms significantly 
      associated with a broad phenotype from depressive symptoms to major depressive 
      disorder. METHODS: We analyzed two prior studies of 70,017 participants of 
      European ancestry from general and clinical populations in the discovery stage. 
      We performed a replication meta-analysis of 28,328 participants. Single 
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability and genetic correlations were 
      calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression. Discovery and 
      replication analyses were performed using a p-value-based meta-analysis. Lifetime 
      major depressive disorder and depressive symptom scores were used as the outcome 
      measures. RESULTS: The SNP-based heritability of major depressive disorder was 
      0.21 (SE = 0.02), the SNP-based heritability of depressive symptoms was 0.04 (SE 
      = 0.01), and their genetic correlation was 1.001 (SE = 0.2). We found one 
      genome-wide significant locus related to the broad depression phenotype 
      (rs9825823, chromosome 3: 61,082,153, p = 8.2 × 10(-9)) located in an intron of 
      the FHIT gene. We replicated this SNP in independent samples (p = .02) and the 
      overall meta-analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts (1.0 × 10(-9)). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This large study identified a new locus for depression. Our results 
      support a continuum between depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder. A 
      phenotypically more inclusive approach may help to achieve the large sample sizes 
      needed to detect susceptibility loci for depression.

TI  - Crop-model assisted phenomics and genome-wide association study for climate 
      adaptation of indica rice. 1. Phenology.
PG  - 4369-4388
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erx249 [doi]
AB  - Phenology and time of flowering are crucial determinants of rice adaptation to 
      climate variation. A previous study characterized flowering responses of 203 
      diverse indica rices (the ORYTAGE panel) to ten environments in Senegal (six 
      sowing dates) and Madagascar (two years and two altitudes) under irrigation in 
      the field. This study used the physiological phenology model RIDEV V2 to 
      heuristically estimate component traits of flowering such as cardinal 
      temperatures (base temperature (Tbase) and optimum temperature), basic vegetative 
      phase, photoperiod sensitivity and cold acclimation, and to conduct a genome-wide 
      association study for these traits using 16 232 anonymous single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) markers. The RIDEV model after genotypic parameter 
      optimization explained 96% of variation in time to flowering for Senegal alone 
      and 91% for Senegal and Madagascar combined. The latter was improved to 94% by 
      including an acclimation parameter reducing Tbase when the crop experienced low 
      temperatures during early vegetative development. Eighteen significant (P<1.0 × 
      10-5) quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified, namely ten for RIDEV 
      parameters and eight for climatic index variables (difference in time to 
      flowering between key environments). Co-localization of QTLs for different traits 
      were rare. RIDEV parameters gave QTLs that were mostly more significant and 
      distinct from QTLs for index variables. Candidate genes were investigated within 
      the estimated 50% linkage disequilibrium regions of 39 kB. In addition to several 
      known flowering network genes, they included genes related to thermal stress 
      adaptation and epigenetic control mechanisms. The peak SNP for a QTL for the crop 
      parameter Tbase (P=2.0 × 10-7) was located within HD3a, a florigen that was 
      recently identified as implicated in flowering under cool conditions.

AB  - Low night and high day temperatures during sensitive reproductive stages cause 
      spikelet sterility in rice. Phenotyping of tolerance traits in the field is 
      difficult because of temporal interactions with phenology and organ temperature 
      differing from ambient. Physiological models can be used to separate these 
      effects. A 203-accession indica rice diversity panel was phenotyped for sterility 
      in ten environments in Senegal and Madagascar and climate data were recorded. 
      Here we report on sterility responses while a companion study reported on 
      phenology. The objectives were to improve the RIDEV model of rice thermal 
      sterility, to estimate response traits by fitting model parameters, and to link 
      the response traits to genomic regions through genome-wide association studies 
      (GWAS). RIDEV captured 64% of variation of sterility when cold acclimation during 
      vegetative stage was simulated, but only 38% when it was not. The RIDEV 
      parameters gave more and stronger quantitative trait loci (QTLs) than index 
      variables derived more directly from observation. The 15 QTLs identified at P<1 × 
      10-5 (33 at P<1 × 10-4) were related to sterility effects of heat, cold, cold 
      acclimation, or unexplained causes (baseline sterility). Nine annotated genes 
      were found on average within the 50% linkage disequilibrium (LD) region. Among 
      them, one to five plausible candidate genes per QTL were identified based on 
      known expression profiles (organ, stage, stress factors) and function. Meiosis-, 
      development- and flowering-related genes were frequent, as well a stress 
      signaling kinases and transcription factors. Putative epigenetic factors such as 
      DNA methylases or histone-related genes were frequent in cold-acclimation QTLs, 
      and positive-effect alleles were frequent in cold-tolerant highland rice from 
      Madagascar. The results indicate that epigenetic control of acclimation may be 
      important in indica rice genotypes adapted to cool environments.

AB  - In sunflower, molecular markers for simple traits as, e.g., fertility 
      restoration, high oleic acid content, herbicide tolerance or resistances to 
      Plasmopara halstedii, Puccinia helianthi, or Orobanche cumana have been 
      successfully used in marker-assisted breeding programs for years. However, 
      agronomically important complex quantitative traits like yield, heterosis, 
      drought tolerance, oil content or selection for disease resistance, e.g., against 
      Sclerotinia sclerotiorum have been challenging and will require genome-wide 
      approaches. Plant genetic resources for sunflower are being collected and 
      conserved worldwide that represent valuable resources to study complex traits. 
      Sunflower association panels provide the basis for genome-wide association 
      studies, overcoming disadvantages of biparental populations. Advances in 
      technologies and the availability of the sunflower genome sequence made novel 
      approaches on the whole genome level possible. Genotype-by-sequencing, and whole 
      genome sequencing based on next generation sequencing technologies facilitated 
      the production of large amounts of SNP markers for high density maps as well as 
      SNP arrays and allowed genome-wide association studies and genomic selection in 
      sunflower. Genome wide or candidate gene based association studies have been 
      performed for traits like branching, flowering time, resistance to Sclerotinia 
      head and stalk rot. First steps in genomic selection with regard to hybrid 
      performance and hybrid oil content have shown that genomic selection can 
      successfully address complex quantitative traits in sunflower and will help to 
      speed up sunflower breeding programs in the future. To make sunflower more 
      competitive toward other oil crops higher levels of resistance against pathogens 
      and better yield performance are required. In addition, optimizing plant 
      architecture toward a more complex growth type for higher plant densities has the 
      potential to considerably increase yields per hectare. Integrative approaches 
      combining omic technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics 
      and phenomics) using bioinformatic tools will facilitate the identification of 
      target genes and markers for complex traits and will give a better insight into 
      the mechanisms behind the traits.

AB  - The availability of electronic health record (EHR)-based phenotypes allows for 
      genome-wide association analyses in thousands of traits and has great potential 
      to enable identification of genetic variants associated with clinical phenotypes. 
      We can interpret the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) result for a single 
      genetic variant by observing its association across a landscape of phenotypes. 
      Because a PheWAS can test thousands of binary phenotypes, and most of them have 
      unbalanced or often extremely unbalanced case-control ratios (1:10 or 1:600, 
      respectively), existing methods cannot provide an accurate and scalable way to 
      test for associations. Here, we propose a computationally fast score-test-based 
      method that estimates the distribution of the test statistic by using the 
      saddlepoint approximation. Our method is much (∼100 times) faster than the 
      state-of-the-art Firth's test. It can also adjust for covariates and control type 
      I error rates even when the case-control ratio is extremely unbalanced. Through 
      application to PheWAS data from the Michigan Genomics Initiative, we show that 
      the proposed method can control type I error rates while replicating previously 
      known association signals even for traits with a very small number of cases and a 
      large number of controls.

AB  - Elucidating metabolic effects of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) may 
      reveal early biomarkers of injury and new treatment targets. This study uses 
      untargeted metabolomics to examine early metabolic alterations in a carefully 
      defined neonatal population. Infants with perinatal asphyxia who were 
      resuscitated at birth and recovered (PA group), those who developed HIE (HIE 
      group) and healthy controls were all recruited at birth. Metabolomic analysis of 
      cord blood was performed using direct infusion FT-ICR mass spectrometry. For each 
      reproducibly detected metabolic feature, mean fold differences were calculated 
      HIE vs. controls (ΔHIE) and PA vs. controls (ΔPA). Putative metabolite 
      annotations were assigned and pathway analysis was performed. Twenty-nine 
      putatively annotated metabolic features were significantly different in ΔPA after 
      false discovery correction ( q < 0.05), with eight of these also significantly 
      altered in ΔHIE. Altered putative metabolites included; melatonin, leucine, 
      kynurenine and 3-hydroxydodecanoic acid which differentiated between infant 
      groups (ΔPA and ΔHIE); and D-erythrose-phosphate, acetone, 3-oxotetradecanoic 
      acid and methylglutarylcarnitine which differentiated across severity grades of 
      HIE. Pathway analysis revealed ΔHIE was associated with a 50% and 75% 
      perturbation of tryptophan and pyrimidine metabolism, respectively. We have 
      identified perturbed metabolic pathways and potential biomarkers specific to PA 
      and HIE, which measured at birth, may help direct treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Photosynthesis can be roughly separated into biochemical and 
      photochemical processes. Both are affected by drought and can be assessed by 
      non-invasive standard methods. Gas exchange, which mainly assesses the first 
      process, has well-defined protocols. It is considered a standard method for 
      evaluation of plant responses to drought. Under such stress, assessment of 
      photochemical apparatus by chlorophyll fluorescence needs improvement to become 
      faster and reproducible, especially in growing plants under field conditions. For 
      this, we developed a protocol based on chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, using a 
      rapid light curve approach. RESULTS: Almost all parameters obtained by rapid 
      light curves have shown statistical differences between control and drought 
      stressed maize plants. However, most of them were affected by induction 
      processes, relaxation rate, and/or differences in chlorophyll content; while they 
      all were influenced by actinic light intensity on each light step of light curve. 
      Only the normalized parameters related to photochemical and non-photochemical 
      quenching were strongly correlated with data obtained by gas exchange, but only 
      from the light step in which the linear electron flow reached saturation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The procedure developed in this study for discrimination of plant 
      responses to water deficit stress proved to be as fast, efficient and reliable as 
      the standard technique of gas exchange in order to discriminate the responses of 
      maize genotypes to drought. However, unlike that, there is no need to perform 
      daily and time consuming calibration routines. Moreover, plant acclimation to the 
      dark is not required. The protocol can be applied to plants growing in both 
      controlled conditions and full sunlight in the field. In addition, it generates 
      parameters in a fast and accurate measurement process, which enables evaluating 
      several plants in a short period of time.

TI  - Interaction between FKBP5 gene and childhood trauma on psychosis, depression and 
      anxiety symptoms in a non-clinical sample.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood trauma has been associated with a heightened risk for 
      presenting clinical and non-clinical psychopathology in adulthood. Genes related 
      with the stress response, such as the FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5), are 
      plausible candidates moderating the effects of childhood trauma on the emergence 
      of such symptoms later on. The present study aimed to explore the moderating role 
      of FKBP5 genetic variability on the association of different types of childhood 
      trauma with subclinical psychosis, depression and anxiety in a non-clinical 
      sample. METHODS: Schizotypy, psychotic-like experiences, depression and anxiety 
      symptoms and childhood trauma were assessed in 808 young adults. Two FKBP5 
      haplotypic blocks were detected: block 1 (rs3800373 - rs9296158 - rs1360780) and 
      block 2 (rs9470080 - rs4713916). Subjects were classified in two groups according 
      to whether they carried or not the risk haplotype previously described in the 
      literature (block 1: CAT and block 2: TA). Linear regression analyses were used 
      to study (i) the main effects of childhood trauma and FKBP5 haplotype blocks and 
      (ii) their interaction effects on the mentioned forms of psychopathology. 
      RESULTS: All childhood trauma scales, except sexual abuse, were associated with 
      schizotypy, psychotic-like experiences, depression and anxiety symptoms. None of 
      the analysed symptoms was associated with the main effects of FKBP5 genetic 
      variability. However an interaction effect between block 1 and physical abuse was 
      observed on anxiety, with lower scores in CAT carriers. This effect was driven by 
      SNP 1 and 2. Moreover, an interaction effect between block 2 and physical abuse 
      was identified on the variables tapping depressive and anxiety symptoms. 
      Specifically, non-TA carrier subjects who were exposed to physical abuse were 
      found to be at higher risk for depressive and anxiety symptoms. These effects 
      were driven by SNP 5. No interaction effect was observed for the other variables. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that exposure to childhood physical abuse may 
      increase the risk for sub-clinical depressive and anxiety symptoms depending on 
      FKBP5 genetic variability. Further research is needed to better elucidate the 
      role of FKBP5 on mental health in clinical and non-clinical cohorts.

TI  - Systematic Discovery of Archaeal Transcription Factor Functions in Regulatory 
      Networks through Quantitative Phenotyping Analysis.
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00032-17 [doi]
LID - e00032-17
AB  - Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are critical for dynamic transcriptional 
      responses to environmental stress. However, the mechanisms by which GRN 
      regulation adjusts physiology to enable stress survival remain unclear. Here we 
      investigate the functions of transcription factors (TFs) within the global GRN of 
      the stress-tolerant archaeal microorganism Halobacterium salinarum. We measured 
      growth phenotypes of a panel of TF deletion mutants in high temporal resolution 
      under heat shock, oxidative stress, and low-salinity conditions. To quantitate 
      the noncanonical functional forms of the growth trajectories observed for these 
      mutants, we developed a novel modeling framework based on Gaussian process 
      regression and functional analysis of variance (FANOVA). We employ unique 
      statistical tests to determine the significance of differential growth relative 
      to the growth of the control strain. This analysis recapitulated known TF 
      functions, revealed novel functions, and identified surprising secondary 
      functions for characterized TFs. Strikingly, we observed that the majority of the 
      TFs studied were required for growth under multiple stress conditions, 
      pinpointing regulatory connections between the conditions tested. Correlations 
      between quantitative phenotype trajectories of mutants are predictive of TF-TF 
      connections within the GRN. These phenotypes are strongly concordant with 
      predictions from statistical GRN models inferred from gene expression data alone. 
      With genome-wide and targeted data sets, we provide detailed functional 
      validation of novel TFs required for extreme oxidative stress and heat shock 
      survival. Together, results presented in this study suggest that many TFs 
      function under multiple conditions, thereby revealing high interconnectivity 
      within the GRN and identifying the specific TFs required for communication 
      between networks responding to disparate stressors. IMPORTANCE To ensure survival 
      in the face of stress, microorganisms employ inducible damage repair pathways 
      regulated by extensive and complex gene networks. Many archaea, microorganisms of 
      the third domain of life, persist under extremes of temperature, salinity, and pH 
      and under other conditions. In order to understand the cause-effect relationships 
      between the dynamic function of the stress network and ultimate physiological 
      consequences, this study characterized the physiological role of nearly one-third 
      of all regulatory proteins known as transcription factors (TFs) in an archaeal 
      organism. Using a unique quantitative phenotyping approach, we discovered 
      functions for many novel TFs and revealed important secondary functions for known 
      TFs. Surprisingly, many TFs are required for resisting multiple stressors, 
      suggesting cross-regulation of stress responses. Through extensive validation 
      experiments, we map the physiological roles of these novel TFs in stress response 
      back to their position in the regulatory network wiring. This study advances 
      understanding of the mechanisms underlying how microorganisms resist extreme 
      stress. Given the generality of the methods employed, we expect that this study 
      will enable future studies on how regulatory networks adjust cellular physiology 
      in a diversity of organisms.

AB  - With the development of platforms enabling the integration and use of phenome, 
      genome, and exposome data in the context of international research, data 
      management challenges are increasing, and scalable solutions for cross border and 
      cross domain semantic interoperability need to be developed. Reusing routinely 
      collected clinical data, especially, requires computable portable phenotype 
      algorithms running across different electronic health record (EHR) products and 
      healthcare systems. We propose a framework for describing and comparing mediation 
      platforms enabling cross border phenotype identification within federated EHRs. 
      This framework was used to describe the experience gained during the EHR4CR 
      project and the evaluation of the platform developed for accessing semantically 
      equivalent data elements across 11 European participating EHR systems from 5 
      countries. Developers of semantic interoperability platforms are beginning to 
      address a core set of requirements in order to reach the goal of developing cross 
      border semantic integration of data.

      microbial workhorses for biomanufacturing of commodity compounds remains 
      challenging. First, microbes cannot afford burdens with both overexpression of 
      multiple enzymes and metabolite drainage for product synthesis. Second, synthetic 
      circuits and introduced heterologous pathways are not yet as "robust and 
      reliable" as native pathways due to hosts' innate regulations, especially under 
      suboptimal fermentation conditions. Third, engineered enzymes may lack channeling 
      capabilities for cascade-like transport of metabolites to overcome diffusion 
      barriers or to avoid intermediate toxicity in the cytoplasmic environment. 
      Fourth, moving engineered hosts from laboratory to industry is unreliable because 
      genetic mutations and non-genetic cell-to-cell variations impair the large-scale 
      fermentation outcomes. Therefore, synthetic biology strains often have 
      unsatisfactory industrial performance (titer/yield/productivity). To overcome 
      these problems, many different species are being explored for their metabolic 
      strengths that can be leveraged to synthesize specific compounds. Here, we 
      provide examples of non-conventional and genetically amenable species for 
      industrial manufacturing, including the following: Corynebacterium glutamicum for 
      its TCA cycle-derived biosynthesis, Yarrowia lipolytica for its biosynthesis of 
      fatty acids and carotenoids, cyanobacteria for photosynthetic production from its 
      sugar phosphate pathways, and Rhodococcus for its ability to biotransform 
      recalcitrant feedstock. Finally, we discuss emerging technologies (e.g., 
      genome-to-phenome mapping, single cell methods, and knowledge engineering) that 
      may facilitate the development of novel cell factories.

AB  - Genetic discovery from the multitude of phenotypes extractable from routine 
      healthcare data can transform understanding of the human phenome and accelerate 
      progress toward precision medicine. However, a critical question when analyzing 
      high-dimensional and heterogeneous data is how best to interrogate increasingly 
      specific subphenotypes while retaining statistical power to detect genetic 
      associations. Here we develop and employ a new Bayesian analysis framework that 
      exploits the hierarchical structure of diagnosis classifications to analyze 
      genetic variants against UK Biobank disease phenotypes derived from 
      self-reporting and hospital episode statistics. Our method displays a more than 
      20% increase in power to detect genetic effects over other approaches and 
      identifies new associations between classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
      alleles and common immune-mediated diseases (IMDs). By applying the approach to 
      genetic risk scores (GRSs), we show the extent of genetic sharing among IMDs and 
      expose differences in disease perception or diagnosis with potential clinical 
      implications.

AB  - Somatic mutation of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 is reported in at least 50% of 
      human malignancies. Most high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSC) have a mutant 
      TP53 allele. Accurate detection of these mutants in heterogeneous tumor tissue is 
      paramount as therapies emerge to target mutant p53. We used a Fluidigm Access 
      Array™ System with Massively Parallel Sequencing (MPS) to analyze DNA extracted 
      from 76 serous ovarian tumors. This dataset has been made available to 
      researchers through the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA; EGAS00001002200). 
      Herein, we present analyses of this dataset using HaplotypeCaller and MuTect2 
      through the Broad Institute's Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK). We anticipate that 
      this TP53 mutation dataset will be useful to researchers developing and testing 
      new software to accurately determine high and low frequency variant alleles in 
      heterogeneous aneuploid tumor tissue. Furthermore, the analysis pipeline we 
      present provides a valuable framework for determining somatic variants more 
      broadly in tumor tissue.

AB  - A wide range of biofluids (urine, serum, plasma, saliva, etc.) as well as 
      cellular and tissue samples can be collected and investigated in clinical 
      metabolomic studies. The choice of sample is dependent on the clinical question 
      being investigated with biofluids typically studied to identify biomarkers, 
      whereas tissues and primary/immortalised cells are typically studied to 
      investigate mechanisms associated with pathophysiological processes. Methods 
      applied to collect samples, quench metabolism and extract samples differ between 
      sample types from simple collect, dilute and analyse methods for urine to complex 
      washing, quenching and biphasic extraction methods for tissues. The range of 
      sample collection and extraction methods are discussed with sample-specific 
      considerations highlighted. Finally, methods for imaging of cells and tissues and 
      for in vivo metabolomic analysis will also be introduced.

TI  - Context-sensitive network-based disease genetics prediction and its implications 
      in drug discovery.
PG  - 1031-1039
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btw737 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Disease phenotype networks play an important role in computational 
      approaches to identifying new disease-gene associations. Current disease 
      phenotype networks often model disease relationships based on pairwise 
      similarities, therefore ignore the specific context on how two diseases are 
      connected. In this study, we propose a new strategy to model disease associations 
      using context-sensitive networks (CSNs). We developed a CSN-based phenome-driven 
      approach for disease genetics prediction, and investigated the translational 
      potential of the predicted genes in drug discovery. RESULTS: We constructed CSNs 
      by directly connecting diseases with associated phenotypes. Here, we constructed 
      two CSNs using different data sources; the two networks contain 26 790 and 13 822 
      nodes respectively. We integrated the CSNs with a genetic functional relationship 
      network and predicted disease genes using a network-based ranking algorithm. For 
      comparison, we built Similarity-Based disease Networks (SBN) using the same 
      disease phenotype data. In a de novo cross validation for 3324 diseases, the 
      CSN-based approach significantly increased the average rank from top 12.6 to top 
      8.8% for all tested genes comparing with the SBN-based approach ( p<e-22 ). The 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the CSN approach was 
      also significantly higher than the SBN approach (0.91 versus 0.87, p<e-3 ). In 
      addition, we predicted genes for Parkinson's disease using CSNs, and demonstrated 
      that the top-ranked genes are highly relevant to PD pathologenesis. We 
      pin-pointed a top-ranked drug target gene for PD, and found its association with 
      neurodegeneration supported by literature. In summary, CSNs lead to significantly 
      improve the disease genetics prediction comparing with SBNs and provide leads for 
      potential drug targets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:

TI  - Impaired embryonic development in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient 
      Caenorhabditis elegans due to abnormal redox homeostasis induced activation of 
      calcium-independent phospholipase and alteration of glycerophospholipid 
      metabolism.

AB  - Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a commonly pervasive 
      inherited disease in many parts of the world. The complete lack of G6PD activity 
      in a mouse model causes embryonic lethality. The G6PD-deficient Caenorhabditis 
      elegans model also shows embryonic death as indicated by a severe hatching 
      defect. Although increased oxidative stress has been implicated in both cases as 
      the underlying cause, the exact mechanism has not been clearly delineated. In 
      this study with C. elegans, membrane-associated defects, including enhanced 
      permeability, defective polarity and cytokinesis, were found in G6PD-deficient 
      embryos. The membrane-associated abnormalities were accompanied by impaired 
      eggshell structure as evidenced by a transmission electron microscopic study. 
      Such loss of membrane structural integrity was associated with abnormal lipid 
      composition as lipidomic analysis revealed that lysoglycerophospholipids were 
      significantly increased in G6PD-deficient embryos. Abnormal glycerophospholipid 
      metabolism leading to defective embryonic development could be attributed to the 
      increased activity of calcium-independent phospholipase A(2) (iPLA) in 
      G6PD-deficient embryos. This notion is further supported by the fact that the 
      suppression of multiple iPLAs by genetic manipulation partially rescued the 
      embryonic defects in G6PD-deficient embryos. In addition, G6PD deficiency induced 
      disruption of redox balance as manifested by diminished NADPH and elevated lipid 
      peroxidation in embryos. Taken together, disrupted lipid metabolism due to 
      abnormal redox homeostasis is a major factor contributing to abnormal embryonic 
      development in G6PD-deficient C. elegans.

AB  - Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection is endemic in the Asia-Pacific region. No 
      specific antiviral drug has been available to treat EV71 infection. Melissa 
      officinalis (MO) is a medicinal plant with long history of usage in the European 
      and Middle East. We investigated whether an aqueous solution of concentrated 
      methanolic extract (MOM) possesses antiviral activity. MOM inhibited plaque 
      formation, cytopathic effect, and viral protein synthesis in EV71-infected cells. 
      Using spectral techniques, we identified rosmarinic acid (RA) as a biologically 
      active constituent of MOM. RA reduced viral attachment and entry; cleavage of 
      eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 G (eIF4G); reactive oxygen species 
      (ROS) generation; and translocation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 
      (hnRNP A1) from nucleus to cytoplasm. It alleviated EV71-induced 
      hyperphosphorylation of p38 kinase and EPS15. RA is likely to suppress 
      ROS-mediated p38 kinase activation, and such downstream molecular events as hnRNP 
      A1 translocation and EPS15-regulated membrane trafficking in EV71-infected cells. 
      These findings suggest that MO and its constituent RA possess anti-EV71 
      activities, and may serve as a candidate drug for therapeutic and prophylactic 
      uses against EV71 infection.

AB  - No effective drug is currently available for treatment of enterovirus 71 (EV71) 
      infection. Schizonepeta tenuifolia Briq. (ST) has been used as a herbal 
      constituent of traditional Chinese medicine. We studied whether the aqueous 
      extract of Schizonepeta tenuifolia Briq (STE) has antiviral activity. STE 
      inhibited replication of EV71, as evident by its ability to diminish plaque 
      formation and cytopathic effect induced by EV71, and to inhibit the synthesis of 
      viral RNA and protein. Moreover, daily single-dose STE treatment significantly 
      improved the survival of EV71-infected mice, and ameliorated the symptoms. 
      Mechanistically, STE exerts multiple effects on enteroviral infection. Treatment 
      with STE reduced viral attachment and entry; the cleavage of eukaryotic 
      translation initiation factor 4 G (eIF4G) by EV71 protease, 2A(pro); 
      virus-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation; and relocation of 
      heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) from the nucleus to the 
      cytoplasm. It was accompanied by a decline in EV71-associated 
      hyperphosphorylation of p38 kinase and EPS15. It is plausible that STE may 
      inhibit ROS-induced p38 kinase activation, and subsequent hnRNP A1 relocation and 
      EPS15-mediated membrane trafficking in infected cells. These findings suggest 
      that STE possesses anti-EV71 activities, and may serve as health food or 
      candidate antiviral drug for protection against EV71.

AB  - Fusarium head blight disease resulting from Fusarium graminearum (FG) infection 
      causes huge losses in global production of cereals and development of 
      FG-resistant plants is urgently needed. To understand biochemistry mechanisms for 
      FG resistance, here, we have systematically investigated the plant metabolomic 
      phenotypes associated with FG resistance for transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana 
      expressing a class-I chitinase (Chi), a Fusarium-specific recombinant antibody 
      gene (CWP2) and fused Chi-CWP2. Plant disease indices, mycotoxin levels, 
      metabonomic characteristics, and expression levels of several key genes were 
      measured together with their correlations. We found that A. thaliana expressing 
      Chi-CWP2 showed higher FG resistance with much lower disease indices and 
      mycotoxin levels than the wild-type and the plants expressing Chi or CWP2 alone. 
      The combined metabonomic and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that such 
      FG-resistance was closely associated with the promoted biosynthesis of secondary 
      metabolites (phenylpropanoids, alkanoids) and organic osmolytes (proline, 
      betaine, glucose, myo-inositol) together with enhanced TCA cycle and GABA shunt. 
      These suggest that the concurrently enhanced biosyntheses of the 
      shikimate-mediated secondary metabolites and organic osmolytes be an important 
      strategy for A. thaliana to develop and improve FG resistance. These findings 
      provide essential biochemical information related to FG resistance which is 
      important for developing FG-resistant cereals.

TI  - Habitat and indigenous gut microbes contribute to the plasticity of gut 
      microbiome in oriental river prawn during rapid environmental change.

LID - e0181427
AB  - Growing evidence points out that the capacity of organisms to acclimate or adapt 
      to new habitat conditions basically depends on their phenomic plasticity 
      attributes, of which their gut commensal microbiota might be an essential impact 
      factor. Especially in aquatic organisms, which are in direct and continual 
      contact with the aquatic environment, the complex and dynamic microbiota have 
      significant effects on health and development. However, an understanding of the 
      relative contribution of internal sorting (host genetic) and colonization 
      (environmental) processes is still unclear. To understand how microbial 
      communities differ in response to rapid environmental change, we surveyed and 
      studied the environmental and gut microbiota of native and habitat-exchanged 
      shrimp (Macrobrachium nipponense) using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on the 
      Illumina MiSeq platform. Corresponding with microbial diversity of their living 
      water areas, the divergence in gut microbes of lake-to-river shrimp (CK) 
      increased, while that of river-to-lake shrimp (KC) decreased. Importantly, among 
      the candidate environment specific gut microbes in habitat-exchanged shrimp, over 
      half of reads were associated with the indigenous bacteria in native shrimp gut, 
      yet more candidates presented in CK may reflect the complexity of new 
      environment. Our results suggest that shrimp gut microbiota has high plasticity 
      when its host faces environmental changes, even over short timescales. Further, 
      the changes in external environment might influence the gut microbiome not just 
      by providing environment-associated microbes directly, but also by interfering 
      with the composition of indigenous gut bacteria indirectly.

TI  - Optimization and Application of Direct Infusion Nanoelectrospray HRMS Method for 
      Large-Scale Urinary Metabolic Phenotyping in Molecular Epidemiology.
PG  - 1646-1658
LID - 10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b01003 [doi]
AB  - Large-scale metabolic profiling requires the development of novel economical 
      high-throughput analytical methods to facilitate characterization of systemic 
      metabolic variation in population phenotypes. We report a fit-for-purpose direct 
      infusion nanoelectrospray high-resolution mass spectrometry (DI-nESI-HRMS) method 
      with time-of-flight detection for rapid targeted parallel analysis of over 40 
      urinary metabolites. The newly developed 2 min infusion method requires <10 μL of 
      urine sample and generates high-resolution MS profiles in both positive and 
      negative polarities, enabling further data mining and relative quantification of 
      hundreds of metabolites. Here we present optimization of the DI-nESI-HRMS method 
      in a detailed step-by-step guide and provide a workflow with rigorous quality 
      assessment for large-scale studies. We demonstrate for the first time the 
      application of the method for urinary metabolic profiling in human 
      epidemiological investigations. Implementation of the presented DI-nESI-HRMS 
      method enabled cost-efficient analysis of >10 000 24 h urine samples from the 
      INTERMAP study in 12 weeks and >2200 spot urine samples from the ARIC study in <3 
      weeks with the required sensitivity and accuracy. We illustrate the application 
      of the technique by characterizing the differences in metabolic phenotypes of the 
      USA and Japanese population from the INTERMAP study.

PG  - 336-345
LID - 10.1038/hr.2016.164 [doi]
AB  - The etiopathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is multifactorial. Adverse 
      blood pressure (BP) is a major independent risk factor for epidemic CVD affecting 
      ~40% of the adult population worldwide and resulting in significant morbidity and 
      mortality. Metabolic phenotyping of biological fluids has proven its application 
      in characterizing low-molecular-weight metabolites providing novel insights into 
      gene-environmental-gut microbiome interaction in relation to a disease state. In 
      this review, we synthesize key results from the INTERnational study of 
      MAcro/micronutrients and blood Pressure (INTERMAP) Study, a cross-sectional 
      epidemiologic study of 4680 men and women aged 40-59 years from Japan, the 
      People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom and the United States. We describe 
      the advancements we have made regarding the following: (1) analytical techniques 
      for high-throughput metabolic phenotyping; (2) statistical analyses for biomarker 
      identification; (3) discovery of unique food-specific biomarkers; and (4) 
      application of metabolome-wide association studies to gain a better understanding 
      into the molecular mechanisms of cross-cultural and regional BP differences.

AB  - Recovery of amino acid (AA) metabolism and the associated clinical implications 
      in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with sustained virological response (SVR) 
      following anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy remains elusive. A prospective 
      cohort study was conducted on 222 CHC patients with SVR. Eighty-two age-matched 
      male genotype 1 (G1) and G2 patients underwent paired serum metabolomics analyses 
      with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to examine AAs before and 
      24 weeks after anti-HCV therapy. Before anti-HCV therapy, G1 patients had a 
      higher HCV RNA level than G2 patients. Twenty-four weeks post-therapy versus 
      pre-therapy, repeated-measures ANOVA showed that the levels of alanine 
      aminotransferase and most AAs decreased while those of lipids, glutamine and 
      putrescine increased in CHC patients. The methionine sulfoxide/methionine ratio 
      decreased, while the asymmetric dimethylarginine/arginine, glutamine/glutamate, 
      citrulline/arginine, ornithine/arginine, kynurenine/tryptophan, 
      tyrosine/phenylalanine and Fisher's ratios increased. Genotype-specific subgroup 
      analyses showed that valine and serotonin/tyrosine increased in G1 and that 
      kynurenine and tyrosine/phenylalanine increased and sarcosine decreased in G2 
      patients. Viral clearance in CHC patients pan-genotypically restored fuel 
      utilization by decelerating the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Following improvement 
      in liver function, the urea, nitric oxide, methionine, and polyamine cycles were 
      accelerated. The cardiometabolic risk attenuated, but the augmented kynurenine 
      pathway activity could increase the oncogenesis risk. The trends in 
      neurotransmitter formation differed between G1 and G2 patients after SVR. 
      Moreover, the HCV-suppressing effect of valine was evident in G1 patients; with 
      the exception of prostate cancer, the oncogenesis risk increased, particularly in 
      G2 patients, at least within 24 weeks post-anti-HCV therapy.

TI  - The protocadherin 17 gene affects cognition, personality, amygdala structure and 
      function, synapse development and risk of major mood disorders.

AB  - Major mood disorders, which primarily include bipolar disorder and major 
      depressive disorder, are the leading cause of disability worldwide and pose a 
      major challenge in identifying robust risk genes. Here, we present data from 
      independent large-scale clinical data sets (including 29 557 cases and 32 056 
      controls) revealing brain expressed protocadherin 17 (PCDH17) as a susceptibility 
      gene for major mood disorders. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning 
      the PCDH17 region are significantly associated with major mood disorders; 
      subjects carrying the risk allele showed impaired cognitive abilities, increased 
      vulnerable personality features, decreased amygdala volume and altered amygdala 
      function as compared with non-carriers. The risk allele predicted higher 
      transcriptional levels of PCDH17 mRNA in postmortem brain samples, which is 
      consistent with increased gene expression in patients with bipolar disorder 
      compared with healthy subjects. Further, overexpression of PCDH17 in primary 
      cortical neurons revealed significantly decreased spine density and abnormal 
      dendritic morphology compared with control groups, which again is consistent with 
      the clinical observations of reduced numbers of dendritic spines in the brains of 
      patients with major mood disorders. Given that synaptic spines are dynamic 
      structures which regulate neuronal plasticity and have crucial roles in myriad 
      brain functions, this study reveals a potential underlying biological mechanism 
      of a novel risk gene for major mood disorders involved in synaptic function and 
      related intermediate phenotypes.

TI  - Identification of a Bipolar Disorder Vulnerable Gene CHDH at 3p21.1.
PG  - 5166-5176
LID - 10.1007/s12035-016-0041-x [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide analysis (GWA) is an effective strategy to discover extreme effects 
      surpassing genome-wide significant levels in studying complex disorders; however, 
      when sample size is limited, the true effects may fail to achieve genome-wide 
      significance. In such case, there may be authentic results among the pools of 
      nominal candidates, and an alternative approach is to consider nominal candidates 
      but are replicable across different samples. Here, we found that mRNA expression 
      of the choline dehydrogenase gene (CHDH) was uniformly upregulated in the brains 
      of bipolar disorder (BPD) patients compared with healthy controls across 
      different studies. Follow-up genetic analyses of CHDH variants in multiple 
      independent clinical datasets (including 11,564 cases and 17,686 controls) 
      identified a risk SNP rs9836592 showing consistent associations with BPD (P 
      (meta) = 5.72 × 10(-4)), and the risk allele indicated an increased CHDH 
      expression in multiple neuronal tissues (lowest P = 6.70 × 10(-16)). These 
      converging results may identify a nominal but true BPD susceptibility gene CHDH. 
      Further exploratory analysis revealed suggestive associations of rs9836592 with 
      childhood intelligence (P = 0.044) and educational attainment (P = 0.0039), a 
      "proxy phenotype" of general cognitive abilities. Intriguingly, the CHDH gene is 
      located at chromosome 3p21.1, a risk region implicated in previous BPD 
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but CHDH is lying outside of the core 
      GWAS linkage disequilibrium (LD) region, and our studied SNP rs9836592 is ∼1.2 Mb 
      3' downstream of the previous GWAS loci (e.g., rs2251219) with no LD between 
      them; thus, the association observed here is unlikely a reflection of previous 
      GWAS signals. In summary, our results imply that CHDH may play a previously 
      unknown role in the etiology of BPD and also highlight the informative value of 
      integrating gene expression and genetic code in advancing our understanding of 
      its biological basis.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating illness that imposes 
      significant emotional and financial burdens on military families. The 
      understanding of PTSD etiology remains elusive; nonetheless, it is clear that 
      PTSD is manifested by a cluster of symptoms including hyperarousal, 
      reexperiencing of traumatic events, and avoidance of trauma reminders. With these 
      characteristics in mind, several rodent models have been developed eliciting 
      PTSD-like features. Animal models with social dimensions are of particular 
      interest, since the social context plays a major role in the development and 
      manifestation of PTSD.For civilians, a core trauma that elicits PTSD might be 
      characterized by a singular life-threatening event such as a car accident. In 
      contrast, among war veterans, PTSD might be triggered by repeated threats and a 
      cumulative psychological burden that coalesced in the combat zone. In capturing 
      this fundamental difference, the aggressor-exposed social stress (Agg-E SS) model 
      imposes highly threatening conspecific trauma on naïve mice repeatedly and 
      randomly.There is abundant evidence that suggests the potential role of genetic 
      contributions to risk factors for PTSD. Specific observations include putatively 
      heritable attributes of the disorder, the cited cases of atypical brain 
      morphology, and the observed neuroendocrine shifts away from normative. Taken 
      together, these features underscore the importance of multi-omics investigations 
      to develop a comprehensive picture. More daunting will be the task of downstream 
      analysis with integration of these heterogeneous genotypic and phenotypic data 
      types to deliver putative clinical biomarkers. Researchers are advocating for a 
      systems biology approach, which has demonstrated an increasingly robust potential 
      for integrating multidisciplinary data. By applying a systems biology approach 
      here, we have connected the tissue-specific molecular perturbations to the 
      behaviors displayed by mice subjected to Agg-E SS. A molecular pattern that links 
      the atypical fear plasticity to energy deficiency was thereby identified to be 
      causally associated with many behavioral shifts and transformations.PTSD is a 
      multifactorial illness sensitive to environmental influence. Accordingly, it is 
      essential to employ the optimal animal model approximating the environmental 
      condition that elicits PTSD-like symptoms. Integration of an optimal animal model 
      with a systems biology approach can contribute to a more knowledge-driven and 
      efficient next-generation care management system and, potentially, prevention of 
      PTSD.

TI  - Genome-Wide Screen for Haploinsufficient Cell Size Genes in the Opportunistic 
      Yeast Candida albicans.
PG  - 355-360
LID - 10.1534/g3.116.037986 [doi]
AB  - One of the most critical but still poorly understood aspects of eukaryotic cell 
      proliferation is the basis for commitment to cell division in late G1 phase, 
      called Start in yeast and the Restriction Point in metazoans. In all species, a 
      critical cell size threshold coordinates cell growth with cell division and 
      thereby establishes a homeostatic cell size. While a comprehensive survey of cell 
      size genetic determinism has been performed in the saprophytic yeasts 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, very little is known in 
      pathogenic fungi. As a number of critical Start regulators are haploinsufficient 
      for cell size, we applied a quantitative analysis of the size phenome, using 
      elutriation-barcode sequencing methodology, to 5639 barcoded heterozygous 
      deletion strains of the opportunistic yeast Candida albicans Our screen 
      identified conserved known regulators and biological processes required to 
      maintain size homeostasis in the opportunistic yeast C. albicans We also 
      identified novel C. albicans-specific size genes and provided a conceptual 
      framework for future mechanistic studies. Interestingly, some of the size genes 
      identified were required for fungal pathogenicity suggesting that cell size 
      homeostasis may be elemental to C. albicans fitness or virulence inside the host.

TI  - Phenotype Analysis of Early Risk Factors from Electronic Medical Records Improves 
      Image-Derived Diagnostic Classifiers for Optic Nerve Pathology.
LID - 101380F [pii]
LID - 10.1117/12.2254618 [doi]
AB  - We examine imaging and electronic medical records (EMR) of 588 subjects over five 
      major disease groups that affect optic nerve function. An objective evaluation of 
      the role of imaging and EMR data in diagnosis of these conditions would improve 
      understanding of these diseases and help in early intervention. We developed an 
      automated image-processing pipeline that identifies the orbital structures within 
      the human eyes from computed tomography (CT) scans, calculates structural size, 
      and performs volume measurements. We customized the EMR-based phenome-wide 
      association study (PheWAS) to derive diagnostic EMR phenotypes that occur at 
      least two years prior to the onset of the conditions of interest from a separate 
      cohort of 28,411 ophthalmology patients. We used random forest classifiers to 
      evaluate the predictive power of image-derived markers, EMR phenotypes, and 
      clinical visual assessments in identifying disease cohorts from a control group 
      of 763 patients without optic nerve disease. Image-derived markers showed more 
      predictive power than clinical visual assessments or EMR phenotypes. However, the 
      addition of EMR phenotypes to the imaging markers improves the classification 
      accuracy against controls: the AUC improved from 0.67 to 0.88 for glaucoma, 0.73 
      to 0.78 for intrinsic optic nerve disease, 0.72 to 0.76 for optic nerve edema, 
      0.72 to 0.77 for orbital inflammation, and 0.81 to 0.85 for thyroid eye disease. 
      This study illustrates the importance of diagnostic context for interpretation of 
      image-derived markers and the proposed PheWAS technique provides a flexible 
      approach for learning salient features of patient history and incorporating these 
      data into traditional machine learning analyses.

AB  - The designation, phenotype, was proposed as a term by Wilhelm Johannsen in 1909. 
      The word is derived from the Greek, phano (showing) and typo (type), phanotypos. 
      Phenotype has become a widely recognized term, even outside of the genetics 
      community, in recent years with the ongoing identification of human disease 
      genes. The term has been defined as the observable constitution of an organism, 
      but sometimes refers to a condition when a person has a particular clinical 
      presentation. Analysis of phenotype is a timely theme because advances in the 
      understanding of the genetic basis of human disease and the emergence of next 
      generation sequencing have spurred a renewed interest in phenotype and the 
      proposal to establish a "Human Phenome Project." This article summarizes the 
      principles of phenotype analysis that are important in medical genetics and 
      describes approaches to comprehensive phenotype analysis in the investigation of 
      patients with human disorders. I discuss the various elements related to disease 
      phenotypes and highlight neurofibromatosis type 1 and the Elements of Morphology 
      Project as illustrations of the principles. In recent years, the notion of "deep 
      phenotyping" has emerged. Currently there are now a number of proposed strategies 
      and resources to approach this concept. Not since the 1960s and 1970s has there 
      been such an exciting time in the history of medicine surrounding the analysis of 
      phenotype in genetic disorders.

TI  - Somatic Embryogenesis in Coffee: The Evolution of Biotechnology and the

AB  - One of the most important crops cultivated around the world is coffee. There are 
      two main cultivated species, Coffea arabica and C. canephora. Both species are 
      difficult to improve through conventional breeding, taking at least 20 years to 
      produce a new cultivar. Biotechnological tools such as genetic transformation, 
      micropropagation and somatic embryogenesis (SE) have been extensively studied in 
      order to provide practical results for coffee improvement. While genetic 
      transformation got many attention in the past and is booming with the CRISPR 
      technology, micropropagation and SE are still the major bottle neck and urgently 
      need more attention. The methodologies to induce SE and the further development 
      of the embryos are genotype-dependent, what leads to an almost empirical 
      development of specific protocols for each cultivar or clone. This is a serious 
      limitation and excludes a general comprehensive understanding of the process as a 
      whole. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of which achievements and 
      molecular insights have been gained in (coffee) somatic embryogenesis and 
      encourage researchers to invest further in the in vitro technology and combine it 
      with the latest omics techniques (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, 
      metabolomics, and phenomics). We conclude that the evolution of biotechnology and 
      the integration of omics technologies offer great opportunities to (i) optimize 
      the production process of SE and the subsequent conversion into rooted plantlets 
      and (ii) to screen for possible somaclonal variation. However, currently the 
      usage of the latest biotechnology did not pass the stage beyond proof of 
      potential and needs to further improve.

TI  - A Comprehensive Image-based Phenomic Analysis Reveals the Complex Genetic 
      Architecture of Shoot Growth Dynamics in Rice (Oryza sativa).
LID - 10.3835/plantgenome2016.07.0064 [doi]
AB  - Early vigor is an important trait for many rice ( L.)-growing environments. 
      However, genetic characterization and improvement for early vigor is hindered by 
      the temporal nature of the trait and strong genotype × environment effects. We 
      explored the genetic architecture of shoot growth dynamics during the early and 
      active tillering stages by applying a functional modeling and genomewide 
      association (GWAS) mapping approach on a diversity panel of ∼360 rice accessions. 
      Multiple loci with small effects on shoot growth trajectory were identified, 
      indicating a complex polygenic architecture. Natural variation for shoot growth 
      dynamics was assessed in a subset of 31 accessions using RNA sequencing and 
      hormone quantification. These analyses yielded a gibberellic acid (GA) catabolic 
      gene, , which could influence GA levels to regulate vigor in the early tillering 
      stage. Given the complex genetic architecture of shoot growth dynamics, the 
      potential of genomic selection (GS) for improving early vigor was explored using 
      all 36,901 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as several subsets of 
      the most significant SNPs from GWAS. Shoot growth trajectories could be predicted 
      with reasonable accuracy using the 50 most significant SNPs from GWAS 
      (0.37-0.53); however, the accuracy of prediction was improved by including more 
      markers, which indicates that GS may be an effective strategy for improving shoot 
      growth dynamics during the vegetative growth stage. This study provides insights 
      into the complex genetic architecture and molecular mechanisms underlying early 
      shoot growth dynamics and provides a foundation for improving this complex trait 
      in rice.

TI  - Interrogating Patient-level Genomics and Mouse Phenomics towards Understanding 
      Cytokines in Colorectal Cancer Metastasis.
PG  - 227-236
AB  - Background: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cancer-related death 
      worldwide and a majority of patients die from metastasis. Chronic intestinal 
      inflammation plays an important role in tumor progression of colorectal cancer. 
      However, few study works on systematically predicting colorectal cancer 
      metastasis using inflammatory cytokine genes. Results: We developed a supervised 
      machine learning approach to predict colorectal cancer tumor progression using 
      patient level genomic features. To better understand the role of cytokines, we 
      integrated the metastatic-related genes from mouse phenotypic data. In addition, 
      pathway analysis and network visualization were also applied to top significant 
      genes ranked by feature weights of the final prediction model. The combined model 
      of cytokines and mouse phenotypes achieved a predictive accuracy of 75.54%, 
      higher than the model based on mouse phenotypes independently (70.42%, 
      p-value<0.05). In additional, the combined model outperformed the model based on 
      the existing metastatic-related epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes 
      (75.54% vs. 71.61%, p-value<0.05). We also observed that the most important 
      cytokine gene features of the our model interact with the cancer driver genes and 
      are highly associated with the colorectal cancer metastasis signaling pathway. 
      Conclusion: We developed a combined model using both cytokine and mouse phenotype 
      information to predict colorectal cancer metastasis. The results suggested that 
      the inflammatory cytokines increase the power of predicting metastasis. We also 
      systematically demonstrated the critical role of cytokines in progression of 
      colorectal tumor.

TI  - Evaluation of Borage Extracts As Potential Biostimulant Using a Phenomic, 
      Agronomic, Physiological, and Biochemical Approach.

AB  - Biostimulants are substances able to improve water and nutrient use efficiency 
      and counteract stress factors by enhancing primary and secondary metabolism. 
      Premise of the work was to exploit raw extracts from leaves (LE) or flowers (FE) 
      of Borago officinalis L., to enhance yield and quality of Lactuca sativa 
      'Longifolia,' and to set up a protocol to assess their effects. To this aim, an 
      integrated study on agronomic, physiological and biochemical aspects, including 
      also a phenomic approach, has been adopted. Extracts were diluted to 1 or 10 mL 
      L(-1), sprayed onto lettuce plants at the middle of the growing cycle and 1 day 
      before harvest. Control plants were treated with water. Non-destructive analyses 
      were conducted to assess the effect of extracts on biomass with an innovative 
      imaging technique, and on leaf photosynthetic efficiency (chlorophyll a 
      fluorescence and leaf gas exchanges). At harvest, the levels of ethylene, 
      photosynthetic pigments, nitrate, and primary (sucrose and total sugars) and 
      secondary (total phenols and flavonoids) metabolites, including the activity and 
      levels of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) were assessed. Moreover, a 
      preliminary study of the effects during postharvest was performed. Borage 
      extracts enhanced the primary metabolism by increasing leaf pigments and 
      photosynthetic activity. Plant fresh weight increased upon treatments with 10 mL 
      L(-1) doses, as correctly estimated by multi-view angles images. Chlorophyll a 
      fluorescence data showed that FEs were able to increase the number of active 
      reaction centers per cross section; a similar trend was observed for the 
      performance index. Ethylene was three-fold lower in FEs treatments. Nitrate and 
      sugar levels did not change in response to the different treatments. Total 
      flavonoids and phenols, as well as the total protein levels, the in vitro PAL 
      specific activity, and the levels of PAL-like polypeptides were increased by all 
      borage extracts, with particular regard to FEs. FEs also proved efficient in 
      preventing degradation and inducing an increase in photosynthetic pigments during 
      storage. In conclusion, borage extracts, with particular regard to the flower 
      ones, appear to indeed exert biostimulant effects on lettuce; future work will be 
      required to further investigate on their efficacy in different conditions and/or 
      species.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease with tens 
      of millions of people affected worldwide. The pathogenesis is still poorly 
      understood and various therapeutical approaches targeting the amyloid β (Aβ) 
      peptide, a product of the amyloidogenic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein 
      (APP), failed. Moreover, a couple of studies critically questioned the relevance 
      of Aβ in the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, new ideas need to be studied and one 
      highly interesting hypothesis is the APP mediated signal transduction to the 
      nucleus. As a consequence nuclear -potentially toxic- structures emerge, which 
      were recently found to a high extent in human AD tissue and thus, may contribute 
      to neurodegeneration. Relevant for the signaling machinery are modifications at 
      the very C-terminal end of the precursor protein, the APP intracellular domain 
      (AICD). In this review we update the knowledge on mechanisms on AICD referring to 
      our 2008 article: The amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD) as 
      modulator of gene expression, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal dynamics-Relevance for 
      Alzheimer's disease (T. Muller, et al., 2008). We summarize how AICD is generated 
      and degraded, we describe its intramolecular motifs, translational modifications, 
      and how those as well as APP dimerization influence AICD generation and function. 
      Moreover, we resume the AICD interactome and elucidate AICDs involvement in 
      nuclear signaling, transcriptional regulation, cell death, DNA repair and cell 
      cycle re-entry and we give insights in its physiological function. Results are 
      summarized in the comprehensive poster "The world of AICD".

AB  - Prevailing knowledge gaps in linking specific molecular changes to apical 
      outcomes and methodological uncertainties in the generation, storage, processing, 
      and interpretation of 'omics data limit the application of 'omics technologies in 
      regulatory toxicology. Against this background, the European Centre for 
      Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) convened a workshop Applying 
      'omics technologies in chemicals risk assessment that is reported herein. Ahead 
      of the workshop, multi-expert teams drafted frameworks on best practices for (i) 
      a Good-Laboratory Practice-like context for collecting, storing and curating 
      'omics data; (ii) the processing of 'omics data; and (iii) weight-of-evidence 
      approaches for integrating 'omics data. The workshop participants confirmed the 
      relevance of these Frameworks to facilitate the regulatory applicability and use 
      of 'omics data, and the workshop discussions provided input for their further 
      elaboration. Additionally, the key objective (iv) to establish approaches to 
      connect 'omics perturbations to phenotypic alterations was addressed. Generally, 
      it was considered promising to strive to link gene expression changes and pathway 
      perturbations to the phenotype by mapping them to specific adverse outcome 
      pathways. While further work is necessary before gene expression changes can be 
      used to establish safe levels of substance exposure, the ECETOC workshop provided 
      important incentives towards achieving this goal.

AB  - The hopes for readily implementable precision medicine are high. For many complex 
      disorders, such as bipolar disorder, these hopes critically hinge on tangible 
      successes in pharmacogenetics of treatment response or susceptibility to adverse 
      events. In this article, we review the current state of pharmacogenomics of 
      bipolar disorder including latest results from candidate genes and genome-wide 
      association studies. The majority of studies focus on response to lithium 
      treatment. Although a host of genes has been studied, hardly any replicated 
      findings have emerged so far. Very small samples sizes and heterogeneous 
      phenotype definition may be considered the major impediments to success in this 
      field. Drawing from current experiences and successes in studies on diagnostic 
      psychiatric phenotypes, we suggest several approaches for our way forward.

AB  - Progress identifying the genetic determinants of personality has historically 
      been slow, with candidate gene studies and small-scale genome-wide association 
      studies yielding few reproducible results. In the UK Biobank study, genetic 
      variants in CADM2 and MSRA were recently shown to influence risk taking behavior 
      and irritability respectively, representing some of the first genomic loci to be 
      associated with aspects of personality. We extend this observation by performing 
      a personality "phenome-scan" across 16 traits in up to 140,487 participants from 
      23andMe for these two genes. Genome-wide heritability estimates for these traits 
      ranged from 5-19%, with both CADM2 and MSRA demonstrating significant effects on 
      multiple personality types. These associations covered all aspects of the big 
      five personality domains, including specific facet traits such as compliance, 
      altruism, anxiety and activity/energy. This study both confirms and extends the 
      original observations, highlighting the role of genetics in aspects of mental 
      health and behavior.

TI  - Genetic effects influencing risk for major depressive disorder in China and 
      Europe.
PG  - e1074
LID - 10.1038/tp.2016.292 [doi]
AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, complex psychiatric disorder and a 
      leading cause of disability worldwide. Despite twin studies indicating its modest 
      heritability (~30-40%), extensive heterogeneity and a complex genetic 
      architecture have complicated efforts to detect associated genetic risk variants. 
      We combined single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) summary statistics from the 
      CONVERGE and PGC studies of MDD, representing 10 502 Chinese (5282 cases and 5220 
      controls) and 18 663 European (9447 cases and 9215 controls) subjects. We 
      determined the fraction of SNPs displaying consistent directions of effect, 
      assessed the significance of polygenic risk scores and estimated the genetic 
      correlation of MDD across ancestries. Subsequent trans-ancestry meta-analyses 
      combined SNP-level evidence of association. Sign tests and polygenic score 
      profiling weakly support an overlap of SNP effects between East Asian and 
      European populations. We estimated the trans-ancestry genetic correlation of 
      lifetime MDD as 0.33; female-only and recurrent MDD yielded estimates of 0.40 and 
      0.41, respectively. Common variants downstream of GPHN achieved genome-wide 
      significance by Bayesian trans-ancestry meta-analysis (rs9323497; log(10) Bayes 
      Factor=8.08) but failed to replicate in an independent European sample (P=0.911). 
      Gene-set enrichment analyses indicate enrichment of genes involved in neuronal 
      development and axonal trafficking. We successfully demonstrate a partially 
      shared polygenic basis of MDD in East Asian and European populations. Taken 
      together, these findings support a complex etiology for MDD and possible 
      population differences in predisposing genetic factors, with important 
      implications for future genetic studies.

AB  - Active and passive sensors are available for ground-based, high-throughput 
      phenotyping in the field. However, these sensor systems have seldom been compared 
      with respect to their determination of plant water status and water use 
      efficiency related parameters under drought conditions. In this study, five 
      passive and active reflectance sensors, including a hyperspectral passive sensor, 
      an active flash sensor (AFS), the Crop Circle, and the GreenSeeker, were 
      evaluated to assess drought-related destructive and non-destructive 
      morphophysiological parameters (ground cover, relative leaf water content, leaf 
      temperature, and carbon isotope discrimination of leaves and grain) and grain 
      yield of twenty wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars. Measurements were 
      conducted in a 2-year study, including a drought stress and a control environment 
      under field conditions. A comparison of the active sensors at the heading, 
      anthesis and grain-filling stages indicated that the Crop Circle provided the 
      most significant and robust relationships with drought-related parameters 
      (relative leaf water content and leaf and grain carbon isotope discrimination). 
      In comparison with the passive sensor, the five water and normalized water 
      indices (WI and NWI-1 to 4), which are only provided by the passive sensor, 
      showed the strongest relationships with the drought stress-related parameters (r 
      = -0.49 to -0.86) and grain yield (r = -0.88) at anthesis. This paper indicates 
      that precision phenotyping allows the integration of water indices in breeding 
      programs to rapidly and cost-effectively identify drought-tolerant genotypes. 
      This is supported by the fact that grain yield and the water indices showed the 
      same heritability under drought conditions.

AB  - Background. The coronary heart disease (CHD) risk locus on 21q22 (lead SNP 
      rs9982601) lies within a "gene desert." The aim of this study was to assess if 
      this locus is associated with CHD risk factors and to identify the functional 
      variant(s) and gene(s) involved. Methods. A phenome scan was performed with UCLEB 
      Consortium data. Allele-specific protein binding was studied using 
      electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Dual-reporter luciferase assays were used 
      to assess the impact of genetic variation on expression. Expression quantitative 
      trait analysis was performed with Advanced Study of Aortic Pathology (ASAP) and 
      Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium data. Results. A suggestive 
      association between QT interval and the locus was observed (rs9982601  p = 0.04). 
      One variant at the locus, rs28451064, showed allele-specific protein binding and 
      its minor allele showed 12% higher luciferase expression (p = 4.82 × 10(-3)) 
      compared to the common allele. The minor allele of rs9982601 was associated with 
      higher expression of the closest upstream genes (SLC5A3 1.30-fold increase p = 
      3.98 × 10(-5); MRPS6 1.15-fold increase p = 9.60 × 10(-4)) in aortic intima media 
      in ASAP. Both rs9982601 and rs28451064 showed a suggestive association with MRPS6 
      expression in relevant tissues in the GTEx data. Conclusions. A candidate 
      functional variant, rs28451064, was identified. Future work should focus on 
      identifying the pathway(s) involved.

AB  - Advances in our understanding of genetic and rare diseases are changing the face 
      of healthcare. Crucially, the global community must implement these advances 
      equitably to reduce health disparities, including between Indigenous and 
      non-Indigenous peoples. We take an Australian perspective to illustrate some key 
      areas that are fundamental to the equitable translation of new knowledge for the 
      improved diagnosis of genetic and rare diseases for Indigenous people. 
      Specifically, we focus on inequalities in access to clinical genetics services 
      and the lack of genetic and phenomic reference data to inform diagnoses. We 
      provide examples of ways in which these inequities are being addressed through 
      Australian partnerships to support a harmonious and inclusive approach to ensure 
      that benefits from traditional wisdom, community knowledge and shared experiences 
      are interwoven to support and inform implementation of new knowledge from 
      genomics and precision public health. This will serve to deliver benefits to all 
      of our diverse citizens, including Indigenous populations.

TI  - Initiating an undiagnosed diseases program in the Western Australian public 
      health system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: New approaches are required to address the needs of complex 
      undiagnosed diseases patients. These approaches include clinical genomic 
      diagnostic pipelines, utilizing intra- and multi-disciplinary platforms, as well 
      as specialty-specific genomic clinics. Both are advancing diagnostic rates. 
      However, complementary cross-disciplinary approaches are also critical to address 
      those patients with multisystem disorders who traverse the bounds of multiple 
      specialties and remain undiagnosed despite existing intra-specialty and 
      genomic-focused approaches. The diagnostic possibilities of undiagnosed diseases 
      include genetic and non-genetic conditions. The focus on genetic diseases 
      addresses some of these disorders, however a cross-disciplinary approach is 
      needed that also simultaneously addresses other disorder types. Herein, we 
      describe the initiation and summary outcomes of a public health system approach 
      for complex undiagnosed patients - the Undiagnosed Diseases Program-Western 
      Australia (UDP-WA). RESULTS: Briefly the UDP-WA is: i) one of a complementary 
      suite of approaches that is being delivered within health service, and with 
      community engagement, to address the needs of those with severe undiagnosed 
      diseases; ii) delivered within a public health system to support equitable access 
      to health care, including for those from remote and regional areas; iii) 
      providing diagnoses and improved patient care; iv) delivering a platform for 
      in-service and real time genomic and phenomic education for clinicians that 
      traverses a diverse range of specialties; v) retaining and recapturing clinical 
      expertise; vi) supporting the education of junior and more senior medical staff; 
      vii) designed to integrate with clinical translational research; and viii) is 
      supporting greater connectedness for patients, families and medical staff. 
      CONCLUSION: The UDP-WA has been initiated in the public health system to 
      complement existing clinical genomic approaches; it has been targeted to those 
      with a specific diagnostic need, and initiated by redirecting existing clinical 
      and financial resources. The UDP-WA supports the provision of equitable and 
      sustainable diagnostics and simultaneously supports capacity building in clinical 
      care and translational research, for those with undiagnosed, typically rare, 
      conditions.

AB  - To optimize plant architecture (e.g., photosynthetic active leaf area, leaf-stem 
      ratio), plant physiologists and plant breeders rely on destructively and 
      tediously harvested biomass samples. A fast and non-destructive method for 
      obtaining information about different plant organs could be vehicle-based 
      spectral proximal sensing. In this 3-year study, the mobile phenotyping platform 
      PhenoTrac 4 was used to compare the measurements from active and passive spectral 
      proximal sensors of leaves, leaf sheaths, culms and ears of 34 spring barley 
      cultivars at anthesis and dough ripeness. Published vegetation indices (VI), 
      partial least square regression (PLSR) models and contour map analysis were 
      compared to assess these traits. Contour maps are matrices consisting of 
      coefficients of determination for all of the binary combinations of wavelengths 
      and the biomass parameters. The PLSR models of leaves, leaf sheaths and culms 
      showed strong correlations (R(2) = 0.61-0.76). Published vegetation indices 
      depicted similar coefficients of determination; however, their RMSEs were higher. 
      No wavelength combination could be found by the contour map analysis to improve 
      the results of the PLSR or published VIs. The best results were obtained for the 
      dry weight and N uptake of leaves and culms. The PLSR models yielded satisfactory 
      relationships for leaf sheaths at anthesis (R(2) = 0.69), whereas only a low 
      performance for all of sensors and methods was observed at dough ripeness. No 
      relationships with ears were observed. Active and passive sensors performed 
      comparably, with slight advantages observed for the passive spectrometer. The 
      results indicate that tractor-based proximal sensing in combination with 
      optimized spectral indices or PLSR models may represent a suitable tool for plant 
      breeders to assess relevant morphological traits, allowing for a better 
      understanding of plant architecture, which is closely linked to the physiological 
      performance. Further validation of PLSR models is required in independent 
      studies. Organ specific phenotyping represents a first step toward breeding by 
      design.

PG  - E4686-E4694
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1613842114 [doi]
AB  - Schizophrenia is a devastating disease that arises on the background of genetic 
      predisposition and environmental risk factors, such as early life stress (ELS). 
      In this study, we show that ELS-induced schizophrenia-like phenotypes in mice 
      correlate with a widespread increase of histone-deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) expression 
      that is linked to altered DNA methylation. Hdac1 overexpression in neurons of the 
      medial prefrontal cortex, but not in the dorsal or ventral hippocampus, mimics 
      schizophrenia-like phenotypes induced by ELS. Systemic administration of an HDAC 
      inhibitor rescues the detrimental effects of ELS when applied after the 
      manifestation of disease phenotypes. In addition to the hippocampus and 
      prefrontal cortex, mice subjected to ELS exhibit increased Hdac1 expression in 
      blood. Moreover, Hdac1 levels are increased in blood samples from patients with 
      schizophrenia who had encountered ELS, compared with patients without ELS 
      experience. Our data suggest that HDAC1 inhibition should be considered as a 
      therapeutic approach to treat schizophrenia.

TI  - Marker Aided Incorporation of Saltol, a Major QTL Associated with Seedling Stage 
      Salt Tolerance, into Oryza sativa 'Pusa Basmati 1121'.

LID - 41
AB  - Pusa Basmati 1121 (PB1121), an elite Basmati rice cultivar is vulnerable to 
      salinity at seedling stage. A study was undertaken to impart seedling-stage salt 
      tolerance into PB1121 by transferring a quantitative trait locus (QTL), Saltol, 
      using FL478 as donor, through marker assisted backcrossing. Sequence tagged 
      microsatellite site (STMS) marker RM 3412, tightly linked to Saltol was used for 
      foreground selection. Background recovery was estimated using 90 genome-wide STMS 
      markers. Systematic phenotypic selection helped in accelerated recovery of 
      recurrent parent phenome (RPP). A set of 51 BC(3)F(2) lines homozygous for Saltol 
      were advanced to develop four improved near isogenic lines (NILs) of PB1121 with 
      seedling stage salt tolerance. The background genome recovery in the NILs ranged 
      from 93.3 to 99.4%. The improved NILs were either similar or better than the 
      recurrent parent PB1121 for yield, grain and cooking quality and duration. 
      Biochemical analyses revealed significant variation in shoot and root Na(+) and 
      K(+) concentrations. Correlation between shoot and root Na(+) concentration was 
      stronger than that between root and shoot K(+) concentration. The effect of QTL 
      integration into the NILs was studied through expression profiling of OsHKT1;5, 
      one of the genes present in the Saltol region. The NILs had significantly higher 
      OsHKT1;5 expression than the recurrent parent PB1121, but lower than FL478 on 
      salt exposure validating the successful introgression of Saltol in the NILs. This 
      was also confirmed under agronomic evaluation, wherein the NILs showed greater 
      salt tolerance at seedling stage. One of the NILs, Pusa1734-8-3-3 (NIL3) showed 
      comparable yield and cooking quality to the recurrent parent PB1121, with high 
      field level seedling stage salinity tolerance and shorter duration. This is the 
      first report of successful introgression of Saltol into a Basmati rice cultivar.

LID - e00037-17
AB  - The function and extracellular location of cell envelope proteins make them 
      attractive candidates for developing vaccines against bacterial diseases, 
      including challenging drug-resistant pathogens, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae A 
      proteomics-driven reverse vaccinology approach has delivered multiple gonorrhea 
      vaccine candidates; however, the biological functions of many of them remain to 
      be elucidated. Herein, the functions of six gonorrhea vaccine candidates-NGO2121, 
      NGO1985, NGO2054, NGO2111, NGO1205, and NGO1344-in cell envelope homeostasis were 
      probed using phenotype microarrays under 1,056 conditions and a ΔbamE mutant 
      (Δngo1780) as a reference of perturbed outer membrane integrity. Optimal growth 
      conditions for an N. gonorrhoeae phenotype microarray assay in defined liquid 
      medium were developed, which can be useful in other applications, including rapid 
      and thorough antimicrobial susceptibility assessment. Our studies revealed 91 
      conditions having uniquely positive or negative effects on one of the examined 
      mutants. A cluster analysis of 37 and 57 commonly beneficial and detrimental 
      compounds, respectively, revealed three separate phenotype groups: NGO2121 and 
      NGO1985; NGO1344 and BamE; and the trio of NGO1205, NGO2111, and NGO2054, with 
      the last protein forming an independent branch of this cluster. Similar 
      phenotypes were associated with loss of these vaccine candidates in the highly 
      antibiotic-resistant WHO X strain. Based on their extensive sensitivity phenomes, 
      NGO1985 and NGO2121 appear to be the most promising vaccine candidates. This 
      study establishes the principle that phenotype microarrays can be successfully 
      applied to a fastidious bacterial organism, such as N. gonorrhoeae IMPORTANCE 
      Innovative approaches are required to develop vaccines against prevalent and 
      neglected sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea. Herein, we have 
      utilized phenotype microarrays in the first such investigation into Neisseria 
      gonorrhoeae to probe the function of proteome-derived vaccine candidates in cell 
      envelope homeostasis. Information gained from this screening can feed the vaccine 
      candidate decision tree by providing insights into the roles these proteins play 
      in membrane permeability, integrity, and overall N. gonorrhoeae physiology. The 
      optimized screening protocol can be applied in investigations into the function 
      of other hypothetical proteins of N. gonorrhoeae discovered in the expanding 
      number of whole-genome sequences, in addition to revealing phenotypic differences 
      between clinical and laboratory strains.

TI  - Fifteen years of quantitative trait loci studies in fish: challenges and future 
      directions.
PG  - 1465-1476
LID - 10.1111/mec.13965 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic variation is a major challenge in 
      biology. Here, we systematically evaluate 146 quantitative trait loci (QTL) 
      studies on teleost fish over the last 15 years to investigate (i) temporal trends 
      and (ii) factors affecting QTL detection and fine-mapping. The number of fish QTL 
      studies per year increased over the review period and identified a cumulative 
      number of 3632 putative QTLs. Most studies used linkage-based mapping approaches 
      and were conducted on nonmodel species with limited genomic resources. A gradual 
      and moderate increase in the size of the mapping population and a sharp increase 
      in marker density from 2011 onwards were observed; however, the number of QTLs 
      and variance explained by QTLs changed only minimally over the review period. 
      Based on these findings, we discuss the causative factors and outline how larger 
      sample sizes, phenomics, comparative genomics, epigenetics and software 
      development could improve both the quantity and quality of QTLs in future 
      genotype-phenotype studies. Given that the technical limitations on DNA 
      sequencing have mostly been overcome in recent years, a renewed focus on these 
      and other study design factors will likely lead to significant improvements in 
      QTL studies in the future.

TI  - Post-genomic behavioral genetics: From revolution to routine.
PG  - e12441
LID - 10.1111/gbb.12441 [doi]
AB  - What was once expensive and revolutionary-full-genome sequence-is now affordable 
      and routine. Costs will continue to drop, opening up new frontiers in behavioral 
      genetics. This shift in costs from the genome to the phenome is most notable in 
      large clinical studies of behavior and associated diseases in cohorts that exceed 
      hundreds of thousands of subjects. Examples include the Women's Health Initiative 
      (www.whi.org), the Million Veterans Program (www. RESEARCH: va.gov/MVP), the 
      100 000 Genomes Project (genomicsengland.co.uk) and commercial efforts such as 
      those by deCode (www.decode.com) and 23andme (www.23andme.com). The same 
      transition is happening in experimental neuro- and behavioral genetics, and 
      sample sizes of many hundreds of cases are becoming routine (www.genenetwork.org, 
      www.mousephenotyping.org). There are two major consequences of this new 
      affordability of massive omics datasets: (1) it is now far more practical to 
      explore genetic modulation of behavioral differences and the key role of 
      gene-by-environment interactions. Researchers are already doing the hard part-the 
      quantitative analysis of behavior. Adding the omics component can provide 
      powerful links to molecules, cells, circuits and even better treatment. (2) There 
      is an acute need to highlight and train behavioral scientists in how best to 
      exploit new omics approaches. This review addresses this second issue and 
      highlights several new trends and opportunities that will be of interest to 
      experts in animal and human behaviors.

TI  - In pursuit of neurophenotypes: The consequences of having autism and a big brain.
PG  - 711-722
LID - 10.1002/aur.1755 [doi]
AB  - A consensus has emerged that despite common core features, autism spectrum 
      disorder (ASD) has multiple etiologies and various genetic and biological 
      characteristics. The fact that there are likely to be subtypes of ASD has 
      complicated attempts to develop effective therapies. The UC Davis MIND Institute 
      Autism Phenome Project is a longitudinal, multidisciplinary analysis of children 
      with autism and age-matched typically developing controls; nearly 400 families 
      are participating in this study. The overarching goal is to gather sufficient 
      biological, medical, and behavioral data to allow definition of clinically 
      meaningful subtypes of ASD. One reasonable hypothesis is that different subtypes 
      of autism will demonstrate different patterns of altered brain organization or 
      development i.e., different neurophenotypes. In this Commentary, we discuss one 
      neurophenotype that is defined by megalencephaly, or having brain size that is 
      large and disproportionate to body size. We have found that 15% of the boys with 
      autism demonstrate this neurophenotype, though it is far less common in girls. We 
      review behavioral and medical characteristics of the large-brained group of boys 
      with autism in comparison to those with typically sized brains. While brain size 
      in typically developing individuals is positively correlated with cognitive 
      function, the children with autism and larger brains have more severe 
      disabilities and poorer prognosis. This research indicates that phenotyping in 
      autism, like genotyping, requires a very substantial cohort of subjects. 
      Moreover, since brain and behavior relationships may emerge at different times 
      during development, this effort highlights the need for longitudinal analyses to 
      carry out meaningful phenotyping. Autism Res 2017, 10: 711-722. © 2017

TI  - Environmental factors, life events, and trauma in the course of bipolar disorder.
PG  - 6-17
LID - 10.1111/pcn.12433 [doi]
AB  - The etiology and clinical course of bipolar disorder are considered to be 
      determined by genetic and environmental factors. Although the kindling hypothesis 
      emphasizes the impact of environmental factors on initial onset, their connection 
      to the outcome and clinical course have been poorly established. Hence, there 
      have been numerous research efforts to investigate the impact of environmental 
      factors on the clinical course of illness. Our aim is to outline recent research 
      on the impact of environmental determinants on the clinical course of bipolar 
      disorder. We carried out a computer-aided search to find publications on an 
      association between environmental factors, life events, and the clinical course 
      of bipolar disorder. Publications in the reference lists of suitable papers have 
      also been taken into consideration. We performed a narrative overview on all 
      eligible publications. The available body of data supports an association between 
      environmental factors and the clinical course of bipolar disorder. These factors 
      comprise prenatal, early-life, and entire lifespan aspects. Given varying sample 
      sizes and several methodological limitations, the reported quality and extent of 
      the association between environmental factors and the clinical course of bipolar 
      disorder should be interpreted with utmost caution. Systematic longitudinal 
      long-term follow-up trials are needed to obtain a clearer and more robust 
      picture.

TI  - Deciphering cyanobacterial phenotypes for fast photoautotrophic growth via 
      isotopically nonstationary metabolic flux analysis.
PG  - 273
LID - 10.1186/s13068-017-0958-y [doi]
LID - 273
AB  - BACKGROUND: Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 is the fastest growing 
      cyanobacterium characterized to date. Its genome was found to be 99.8% identical 
      to S. elongatus 7942 yet it grows twice as fast. Current genome-to-phenome 
      mapping is still poorly performed for non-model organisms. Even for species with 
      identical genomes, cell phenotypes can be strikingly different. To understand 
      Synechococcus 2973's fast-growth phenotype and its metabolic features 
      advantageous to photo-biorefineries, (13)C isotopically nonstationary metabolic 
      flux analysis (INST-MFA), biomass compositional analysis, gene knockouts, and 
      metabolite profiling were performed on both strains under various growth 
      conditions. RESULTS: The Synechococcus 2973 flux maps show substantial carbon 
      flow through the Calvin cycle, glycolysis, photorespiration and pyruvate kinase, 
      but minimal flux through the malic enzyme and oxidative pentose phosphate 
      pathways under high light/CO(2) conditions. During fast growth, its pool sizes of 
      key metabolites in central pathways were lower than suboptimal growth. 
      Synechococcus 2973 demonstrated similar flux ratios to Synechococcus 7942 (under 
      fast growth conditions), but exhibited greater carbon assimilation, higher NADPH 
      concentrations, higher energy charge (relative ATP ratio over ADP and AMP), less 
      accumulation of glycogen, and potentially metabolite channeling. Furthermore, 
      Synechococcus 2973 has very limited flux through the TCA pathway with small pool 
      sizes of acetyl-CoA/TCA intermediates under all growth conditions. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study employed flux analysis to investigate phenotypic heterogeneity among 
      two cyanobacterial strains with near-identical genome background. The 
      flux/metabolite profiling, biomass composition analysis, and genetic modification 
      results elucidate a highly effective metabolic topology for CO(2) assimilatory 
      and biosynthesis in Synechococcus 2973. Comparisons across multiple Synechococcus 
      strains indicate faster metabolism is also driven by proportional increases in 
      both photosynthesis and key central pathway fluxes. Moreover, the flux 
      distribution in Synechococcus 2973 supports the use of its strong sugar phosphate 
      pathways for optimal bio-productions. The integrated methodologies in this study 
      can be applied for characterizing non-model microbial metabolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, khat chewing has become a common practice among high 
      school, college, and university students. Regular khat chewing is thought to be a 
      predisposing factor for different physical and mental health problems. It can 
      lead to absenteeism from work and classes. In Ethiopia, to our knowledge no 
      published study has investigated khat withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, this study 
      was conducted to determine the prevalence, withdrawal symptoms, and associated 
      factors of khat chewing among regular undergraduate students on the main campus 
      of Jimma University in Ethiopia. METHODS: The institution-based, cross-sectional 
      study was conducted in January 2016. Data were collected from 651 main campus 
      regular undergraduate students with a structured, self-administered 
      questionnaire, entered into Epidata 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 for 
      Windows. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to explore 
      associations and identify variables independently associated with khat chewing. 
      RESULTS: The study found that the lifetime and current prevalence of khat chewing 
      among students were 26.3% (95% CI: 24.3, 28.3) and 23.9% (95% CI: 21.94, 25.86), 
      respectively. About 25.7% of students started chewing after joining university, 
      and 60.5% of these students started during their first year. The main reason 
      given for starting khat chewing was for study purposes (54.6%), followed by 
      socialization purposes (42.3%). Among current khat chewers, 72.9% reported that 
      they had chewed khat for 1 year or more and 68.2% reported that they had 
      experienced various withdrawal symptoms. The most frequently reported withdrawal 
      symptoms were feeling depressed, craving, and feeling fatigued. Being male, 
      attending a place of worship daily/2-3 times per week, cannabis use, smoking 
      cigarettes, and having family members currently chewing khat were independently 
      associated with khat chewing. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that large numbers of 
      university students were currently chewing khat. In this study withdrawal 
      symptoms and factors that significantly affect khat chewing were identified. 
      Besides it gave new ideas regarding khat withdrawal symptoms in Ethiopia. It 
      serves as a critical role of providing information to form rational foundation 
      for public health policy, prevention and planning to bring change in contributing 
      factors for Khat chewing. The finding will be serving as base line information 
      for further study.

      challenges, and priorities for future research.

AB  - Advancing the production efficiency and profitability of aquaculture is dependent 
      upon the ability to utilize a diverse array of genetic resources. The ultimate 
      goals of aquaculture genomics, genetics and breeding research are to enhance 
      aquaculture production efficiency, sustainability, product quality, and 
      profitability in support of the commercial sector and for the benefit of 
      consumers. In order to achieve these goals, it is important to understand the 
      genomic structure and organization of aquaculture species, and their genomic and 
      phenomic variations, as well as the genetic basis of traits and their 
      interrelationships. In addition, it is also important to understand the 
      mechanisms of regulation and evolutionary conservation at the levels of genome, 
      transcriptome, proteome, epigenome, and systems biology. With genomic information 
      and information between the genomes and phenomes, technologies for marker/causal 
      mutation-assisted selection, genome selection, and genome editing can be 
      developed for applications in aquaculture. A set of genomic tools and resources 
      must be made available including reference genome sequences and their annotations 
      (including coding and non-coding regulatory elements), genome-wide polymorphic 
      markers, efficient genotyping platforms, high-density and high-resolution linkage 
      maps, and transcriptome resources including non-coding transcripts. Genomic and 
      genetic control of important performance and production traits, such as disease 
      resistance, feed conversion efficiency, growth rate, processing yield, behaviour, 
      reproductive characteristics, and tolerance to environmental stressors like low 
      dissolved oxygen, high or low water temperature and salinity, must be understood. 
      QTL need to be identified, validated across strains, lines and populations, and 
      their mechanisms of control understood. Causal gene(s) need to be identified. 
      Genetic and epigenetic regulation of important aquaculture traits need to be 
      determined, and technologies for marker-assisted selection, causal 
      gene/mutation-assisted selection, genome selection, and genome editing using 
      CRISPR and other technologies must be developed, demonstrated with applicability, 
      and application to aquaculture industries.Major progress has been made in 
      aquaculture genomics for dozens of fish and shellfish species including the 
      development of genetic linkage maps, physical maps, microarrays, single 
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, transcriptome databases and various stages 
      of genome reference sequences. This paper provides a general review of the 
      current status, challenges and future research needs of aquaculture genomics, 
      genetics, and breeding, with a focus on major aquaculture species in the United 
      States: catfish, rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, tilapia, striped bass, oysters, 
      and shrimp. While the overall research priorities and the practical goals are 
      similar across various aquaculture species, the current status in each species 
      should dictate the next priority areas within the species. This paper is an 
      output of the USDA Workshop for Aquaculture Genomics, Genetics, and Breeding held 
      in late March 2016 in Auburn, Alabama, with participants from all parts of the 
      United States.

AB  - Summaryplantcell;29/9/tpc.117.tt0917/FIG1F1fig1One of roots' key roles is to 
      secure access to water and nutrients for the plant, often in a highly 
      heterogeneous and challenging environment. To cope with such function, root 
      systems have evolved as highly plastic, responsive and diverse organs. However, 
      due to technical constraints, root research has long been stuck in its infancy. 
      This teaching tool discusses the relatively young field of root system 
      architecture quantification. It introduces the concepts of phenes (like genes, 
      but referring to the phenotype), and architectural concepts including morphology, 
      geometry, and topology. It concludes by discussing the practical considerations 
      linked to the root system architecture quantification (including growth and 
      sampling methods), and different data analysis methods. Posted September 20,

TI  - Ultra-rare genetic variation in common epilepsies: a case-control sequencing 
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite progress in understanding the genetics of rare epilepsies, 
      the more common epilepsies have proven less amenable to traditional 
      gene-discovery analyses. We aimed to assess the contribution of ultra-rare 
      genetic variation to common epilepsies. METHODS: We did a case-control sequencing 
      study with exome sequence data from unrelated individuals clinically evaluated 
      for one of the two most common epilepsy syndromes: familial genetic generalised 
      epilepsy, or familial or sporadic non-acquired focal epilepsy. Individuals of any 
      age were recruited between Nov 26, 2007, and Aug 2, 2013, through the multicentre 
      Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project and Epi4K collaborations, and samples were 
      sequenced at the Institute for Genomic Medicine (New York, USA) between Feb 6, 
      2013, and Aug 18, 2015. To identify epilepsy risk signals, we tested all 
      protein-coding genes for an excess of ultra-rare genetic variation among the 
      cases, compared with control samples with no known epilepsy or epilepsy 
      comorbidity sequenced through unrelated studies. FINDINGS: We separately compared 
      the sequence data from 640 individuals with familial genetic generalised epilepsy 
      and 525 individuals with familial non-acquired focal epilepsy to the same group 
      of 3877 controls, and found significantly higher rates of ultra-rare deleterious 
      variation in genes established as causative for dominant epilepsy disorders 
      (familial genetic generalised epilepsy: odd ratio [OR] 2·3, 95% CI 1·7-3·2, 
      p=9·1 × 10(-8); familial non-acquired focal epilepsy 3·6, 2·7-4·9, 
      p=1·1 × 10(-17)). Comparison of an additional cohort of 662 individuals with 
      sporadic non-acquired focal epilepsy to controls did not identify study-wide 
      significant signals. For the individuals with familial non-acquired focal 
      epilepsy, we found that five known epilepsy genes ranked as the top five genes 
      enriched for ultra-rare deleterious variation. After accounting for the control 
      carrier rate, we estimate that these five genes contribute to the risk of 
      epilepsy in approximately 8% of individuals with familial non-acquired focal 
      epilepsy. Our analyses showed that no individual gene was significantly 
      associated with familial genetic generalised epilepsy; however, known epilepsy 
      genes had lower p values relative to the rest of the protein-coding genes 
      (p=5·8 × 10(-8)) that were lower than expected from a random sampling of genes. 
      INTERPRETATION: We identified excess ultra-rare variation in known epilepsy 
      genes, which establishes a clear connection between the genetics of common and 
      rare, severe epilepsies, and shows that the variants responsible for epilepsy 
      risk are exceptionally rare in the general population. Our results suggest that 
      the emerging paradigm of targeting of treatments to the genetic cause in rare 
      devastating epilepsies might also extend to a proportion of common epilepsies. 
      These findings might allow clinicians to broadly explain the cause of these 
      syndromes to patients, and lay the foundation for possible precision treatments 
      in the future. FUNDING: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

AB  - The classic epileptic encephalopathies, including infantile spasms (IS) and 
      Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), are severe seizure disorders that usually arise 
      sporadically. De novo variants in genes mainly encoding ion channel and synaptic 
      proteins have been found to account for over 15% of patients with IS or LGS. The 
      contribution of autosomal recessive genetic variation, however, is less well 
      understood. We implemented a rare variant transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) 
      to search for autosomal recessive epileptic encephalopathy genes in a cohort of 
      320 outbred patient-parent trios that were generally prescreened for rare 
      metabolic disorders. In the current sample, our rare variant transmission 
      disequilibrium test did not identify individual genes with significantly 
      distorted transmission over expectation after correcting for the multiple tests. 
      While the rare variant transmission disequilibrium test did not find evidence of 
      a role for individual autosomal recessive genes, our current sample is 
      insufficiently powered to assess the overall role of autosomal recessive 
      genotypes in an outbred epileptic encephalopathy population.
